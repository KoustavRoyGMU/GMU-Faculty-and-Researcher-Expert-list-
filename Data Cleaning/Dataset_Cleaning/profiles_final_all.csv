 ",703-993-5168," Ilhan Izmirli grew up surrounded by books and a profound sense of deference for education, a practice, which, according to Oscar Wilde (1854 – 1900), “makes one rogue cleverer than another.” To Izmirli, the pursuit of knowledge is at once esoteric and abstract for the sole purpose of attaining intellectual maturity, cultural sensitivity, and social consciousness. As he continued academic study, he was equally attracted to literature, mathematics, music, and physics and was having a hard time deciding which one of these disciplines to study in college. Before graduating from high school, Izmirli was exposed to the vast universality of mathematics. The infiniteness that arose from relatively simple situations left him enthralled with serious computation. Inspired by his first encounter with tessellation of planar mathematics and its application in natural studies, Izmirli has devoted his research to mathematics and statistics education; philosophy of mathematics; philosophy of science; history of mathematics; relations between mathematics and other disciplines such as physics, philosophy, and music; and chaos theory. He has presented numerous papers on these and related topics in international conferences throughout the world.

Computer Science",N/A," Greg Stein wants to bring about a future in which robots act more intelligently in a dynamic and uncertain world and engender trust in the humans with whom they share it. Even as robots have started to populate our world, they are limited in the types of things they can do and struggle to accomplish even simple tasks in places that they've never been before. Greg's research is devoted to changing how robots think about uncertainty so that they can make predictions about their surroundings from experience and understand the role their actions play in shaping their environment. His work so far—nominated for best paper and awarded best oral presentation at the 2018 Conference on Robot Learning—has predominantly focused on effective navigation in previously-unseen buildings, and he is working on expanding his research to improve home-care robotics and self-driving vehicles. His ongoing work is devoted to imbuing autonomous agents with the ability to better explain their decision-making when faced with uncertainty, a critical capability if robots are to realize their full potential and safely operate alongside people. Greg believes that effective communication and mentorship are critical components of a successful research lab. As a graduate student, he was an active member of the community, and his work as a volunteer communication advisor and as a wellness coach helped him to become an effective communicator and to cope with the challenges of graduate school, experiences he works to pass along to his students.

A good example is to imagine a single human operator trying to control a swarm of 1000 robots. It is impossible for the human to send individual commands to each robot, but rather the human should send a high level command to the entire swarm. It is then up to the individual robots in the swarm to determine how to locally move within the swarm to ensure completion of the global task. A large motivation for the specific challenges he is interested in include minimizing energy or wireless communication, efficient computation of control strategies or decisions, and the use of sparse sensing and/or control.

He is a professor in the ECE Department at Mason, where he currently co-directs the Cryptographic Engineering Research Group – CERG - one of the largest and most widely recognized applied-cryptography groups in the United States. His major research projects have been devoted to the evaluation of cryptographic algorithms competing to become new American and international standards. Gaj and his team compare these ciphers from the point of view of their performance in hardware and embedded systems. His work was instrumental in selecting Rijndael as a new Advanced Encryption Standard - AES, and Keccak as a new cryptographic hash function standard – SHA-3. He also played a major role in performing and coordinating benchmarking of over 25 authenticated ciphers competing in the CAESAR contest. He is currently involved in evaluating candidates for two new U.S. federal standards in the areas of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Lightweight Cryptography (LWC). The former of these two standards is related to the rise of quantum computers, which may one day wipe out the majority of modern cryptography as we know it. As a result, researchers, such as Gaj, are working right now to find a suitable replacement. In his college years, Gaj wrote a book on the German Enigma machine and the techniques and machines used to break Hitler's code before and during World War II. Although his research interests shifted afterward to modern cryptography, he still incorporates Enigma's story into his classes on encryption and codebreaking. Gaj leads students to greater understanding and acuity in cryptographic engineering, advanced digital system design, software/hardware codesign, and electronic design automation in a variety of senior and graduate courses. Beyond the classroom, Gaj interacts with numerous international professionals and academic communities in his field of research.

There are many uses for operations research, but one of the most difficult problems that Rajesh Ganesan investigates is the sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. His operations research applications include decision making in cybersecurity, defense, health care and air traffic management. Ganesan focuses his research at the Center for Secure Information Systems on dynamic allocation of cybersecurity analyst resource to detect intrusions and maintain a desirable level of operational effectiveness. In one of his recent papers, he provided a framework for establishing and maintaining an effective cybersecurity analyst workforce to minimize cybersecurity risk.  His health care research work addresses a very important public policy and ethical problem: who, among those waiting, should be selected for a liver transplant, not only minimizing geographical disparity in access to livers but also extending organ life.   In a recent paper, Ganesan explored the use of a fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) model for determining convoy schedules and route clearance assignments in light of attack dangers faced by transportation networks where improvised explosive device (IED) attacks are common. There is an exigent need for a timely solution to this dangerous and enduring problem faced by US military personnel. Ganesan’s research has offered opportunities for meaningful improvements to the safety of convoys using RL algorithms; the same research could one day be applied to other safety and risk management processes in the civilian environment. At the Center for Air Transportation Systems Research (CATSR), Ganesan’s research is focused on air traffic management issues such as minimizing taxi waiting-time in busy airports. This work is very important due to the huge economic impact of delayed and cancelled flights on all stakeholders of the air transportation industry. Mason’s CATSR was founded in 2003.

254,Jeffrey Moran,"Assistant Professor, Affiliate faculty in Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering",703-993-5636," Jeffrey Moran's research interests lie in understanding and using micro-scale thermal-fluid transport phenomena to enable new solutions to fundamental challenges facing humanity, including sustainable energy, environmental remediation, and cancer treatment. His doctoral work helped explain the physical mechanism for the self-propulsion of ""catalytic micromotors,"" which are micrometer-size metallic rods (50 times smaller than the width of a human hair) that can ""swim"" and carry cargo through liquids. These rods are one subclass of ""active colloids,"" microscopic self-propelled particles, which show promise for such applications as enhanced oil recovery, manufacturing of micro- and nanometer-scale structures, and even targeted drug delivery in the human body. Moran received several awards, including the Young Researcher Award from the International Workshop on Micro/Nanomachines, the Shapiro Postdoctoral Fellowship Award from MIT, and a Graduate Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation. Outside of research, he is committed to science and engineering education in and out of the classroom. He has given workshops at local science museums and lectured (at both the general and technical levels) to university and high school students throughout the US and internationally.

260,Robert Handler,Professor and Director of Graduate Programs,703-993-3845,"Robert Handler received a PhD in mechanics from the University of Minnesota (1980). Most recently he was a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University. Previous to this he was a Research Mechanical Engineer at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C., where he was head of the Fluid Dynamics Section in the Remote Sensing Division. Throughout his career Dr. Handler has been actively involved in the study of turbulent fluid flows. His main achievement in this area was to uncover the fundamental structure of turbulent flows near the surfaces of ships or jet aircraft. The puzzling phenomenon of drag reduction associated with the injection of small amounts of polymer into turbulent flows of liquids has been a major focus of his work. He and his collaborators were the first to simulate this phenomenon using advanced computational methods. This knowledge might be used in the future to design optimal drag reducing agents, resulting in significant energy savings. In general, Dr. Handler gets his greatest pleasure by trying to understand phenomena which are currently poorly understood and counterintuitive. Along these lines, he has recently received an NSF grant to study the very puzzling phenomenon of fluid turbulence appearing in low speed flows caused by fluid elasticity. He also gets great enjoyment from teaching undergraduates about the strange behavior exhibited by fluids in motion.",N/A,N/A,https://cec.gmu.edu/profiles/rhandler,rhandler@gmu.edu,"https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/bbcswebdav/xid-216062023_1
