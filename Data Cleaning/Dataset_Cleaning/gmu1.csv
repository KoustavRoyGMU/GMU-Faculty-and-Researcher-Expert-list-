 ",703-993-5168," Ilhan Izmirli grew up surrounded by books and a profound sense of deference for education, a practice, which, according to Oscar Wilde (1854 – 1900), “makes one rogue cleverer than another.” To Izmirli, the pursuit of knowledge is at once esoteric and abstract for the sole purpose of attaining intellectual maturity, cultural sensitivity, and social consciousness. As he continued academic study, he was equally attracted to literature, mathematics, music, and physics and was having a hard time deciding which one of these disciplines to study in college. Before graduating from high school, Izmirli was exposed to the vast universality of mathematics. The infiniteness that arose from relatively simple situations left him enthralled with serious computation. Inspired by his first encounter with tessellation of planar mathematics and its application in natural studies, Izmirli has devoted his research to mathematics and statistics education; philosophy of mathematics; philosophy of science; history of mathematics; relations between mathematics and other disciplines such as physics, philosophy, and music; and chaos theory. He has presented numerous papers on these and related topics in international conferences throughout the world.

63,63,Gregory Stein,"Assistant Professor
Computer Science",," Greg Stein wants to bring about a future in which robots act more intelligently in a dynamic and uncertain world and engender trust in the humans with whom they share it. Even as robots have started to populate our world, they are limited in the types of things they can do and struggle to accomplish even simple tasks in places that they've never been before. Greg's research is devoted to changing how robots think about uncertainty so that they can make predictions about their surroundings from experience and understand the role their actions play in shaping their environment. His work so far—nominated for best paper and awarded best oral presentation at the 2018 Conference on Robot Learning—has predominantly focused on effective navigation in previously-unseen buildings, and he is working on expanding his research to improve home-care robotics and self-driving vehicles. His ongoing work is devoted to imbuing autonomous agents with the ability to better explain their decision-making when faced with uncertainty, a critical capability if robots are to realize their full potential and safely operate alongside people. Greg believes that effective communication and mentorship are critical components of a successful research lab. As a graduate student, he was an active member of the community, and his work as a volunteer communication advisor and as a wellness coach helped him to become an effective communicator and to cope with the challenges of graduate school, experiences he works to pass along to his students.

He is a professor in the ECE Department at Mason, where he currently co-directs the Cryptographic Engineering Research Group – CERG - one of the largest and most widely recognized applied-cryptography groups in the United States. His major research projects have been devoted to the evaluation of cryptographic algorithms competing to become new American and international standards. Gaj and his team compare these ciphers from the point of view of their performance in hardware and embedded systems. His work was instrumental in selecting Rijndael as a new Advanced Encryption Standard - AES, and Keccak as a new cryptographic hash function standard – SHA-3. He also played a major role in performing and coordinating benchmarking of over 25 authenticated ciphers competing in the CAESAR contest. He is currently involved in evaluating candidates for two new U.S. federal standards in the areas of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Lightweight Cryptography (LWC). The former of these two standards is related to the rise of quantum computers, which may one day wipe out the majority of modern cryptography as we know it. As a result, researchers, such as Gaj, are working right now to find a suitable replacement. In his college years, Gaj wrote a book on the German Enigma machine and the techniques and machines used to break Hitler's code before and during World War II. Although his research interests shifted afterward to modern cryptography, he still incorporates Enigma's story into his classes on encryption and codebreaking. Gaj leads students to greater understanding and acuity in cryptographic engineering, advanced digital system design, software/hardware codesign, and electronic design automation in a variety of senior and graduate courses. Beyond the classroom, Gaj interacts with numerous international professionals and academic communities in his field of research.
