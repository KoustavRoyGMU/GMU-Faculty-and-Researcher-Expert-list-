MyTime: Designing and Evaluating an Intervention for Smartphone Non-Use,"Alexis Hiniker, Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Kohon Tadayoshi, Julie Kientz",2016,Conference 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing System,"Though many people report an interest in self-limiting certain aspects of their phone use, challenges adhering to self-defined limits are common. We conducted a design exercise and online survey to map the design space of interventions for smartphone non-use and distilled these into a small taxonomy of intervention categories. Using these findings, we implemented ""MyTime,"" an intervention to support people in achieving goals related to smartphone non-use. We conducted a deployment study with 23 participants over two weeks and found that participants reduced their time with the apps they feel are a poor use of time by 21% while their use of the apps they feel are a good use of time remained unchanged. We found that a small taxonomy describes users' diverse set of desired behavior changes relating to smartphone non-use, and that these desired changes predict: 1) the hypothetical features they are …",115
"Human factors in model interpretability: Industry practices, challenges, and needs","Sungsoo Ray Hong, Jessica Hullman, Enrico Bertini",2020/5/28,Journal Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,"As the use of machine learning (ML) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. While scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like HCI, ML, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. This lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. To bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. Based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we …",99

Efficient elicitation approaches to estimate collective crowd answers,"John Joon Young Chung, Jean Y Song, Sindhu Kutty, Sungsoo Hong, Juho Kim, Walter S Lasecki",2019/11/7,Journal Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,"When crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. Unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. Despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. In this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. We investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. Annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking …",35

Traffigram: distortion for clarification via isochronal cartography,"Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Yea-Seul Kim, Jong-Chul Yoon, Cecilia R Aragon",2014/4/26,Conference ACM SIGCHI 2014,"Most geographic maps visually represent physical distance; however, travel time can in some cases be more important than distance because it directly indicates availability. The technique of creating maps from temporal data is known as isochronal cartography, and is a form of distortion for clarification. In an isochronal map, congestion expands areas, while ideal travel conditions make the map shrink in comparison to the actual distance scale of a traditional map. Although there have been many applications of this technique, detailed user studies of its efficacy remain scarce, and there are conflicting views on its practical value. To attempt to settle this issue, we utilized a user-centered design process to determine which features of isochronal cartography might be most usable in practice.

Visual representations of distance cartograms,"Sungsoo Hong, Cecilia Aragon, Min-Joon Yoo",2017/9/26,Patent office US,"Technology for generating high perceptual-quality distance cartograms, which use geo-contextual anchors to avoid topological violations, is disclosed. A system can calculate the travel times between a selected origin of the graph, and other locations within the graph based on a graph describing the transportation network within a region (eg, an urban setting) and data describing travel conditions. Other nodes are then shifted such that the distances between them and the origin are reflective of the travel times between them. When a shifted node violates the topology of the transportation network, which hamper a user's ability to utilize a map due to disruptions in the physical relations between adjacent nodes and map overlaps, the node is instead placed at an alternate location that does not result in a violation.

Designing Interactive Distance Cartograms to Support Urban Travelers,"Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Rafal Kocielnik, Min-Joon Yoo, Sarah Battersby, Juho Kim, Cecilia Aragon",2017/4,Journal IEEE PacificVis 2017,"A distance cartogram (DC) is a technique that alters distances between a user-specified origin and the other locations in a map with respect to travel time.

Such glance-ability is known to be useful for travelers who are mindful of travel time when finding their travel destinations. When constructing DC, however, uneven urban traffic conditions introduce excessive distortion and challenge user intuition.

FlatMagic: Improving Flat Colorization through AI-Driven Design for Digital Comic Professionals,"Chuan Yan, John Joon Young Chung, Yoon Kiheon, Yotam Gingold, Eytan Adar, Sungsoo Ray Hong",2022/4/29,Book Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems," Creating digital comics involves multiple stages, some creative and some menial. For example, coloring a comic requires a labor-intensive stage known as ‘flatting,’ or masking segments of continuous color, as well as creative shading, lighting, and stylization stages. The use of AI can automate the colorization process, but early efforts have revealed limitations—technical and UX—to full automation. Via a formative study of professionals, we identify flatting as a bottleneck and key target of opportunity for human-guided AI-driven automation. Based on this insight, we built FlatMagic, an interactive, AI-driven flat colorization support tool for Photoshop. Our user studies found that using FlatMagic significantly reduced professionals’ real and perceived effort versus their current practice.

Designing tools to support advanced users in new forms of social media interaction,"Hyunggu Jung, Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Perry Meas, Mark Zachry",2015/7,Conference ACM SIGDOC 2015,"Interface design practices in social media systems change rapidly, routinely presenting new tools and functionalities. In order to attract a broad base of users and acceptance of system enhancements, interface designs are typically highly conventional, building on best practices in HCI. In such systems, the needs of advanced users are often secondary. To probe how the design of tools should be adjusted to the needs of advanced users, we created CrediVis, a tool for visualizing multi-dimensional user data in Wikipedia. Through a two-round study of advanced users, we find that such users value specialized and complex tools designed to fit their needs. We further observed that although they value such advanced tools they prefer conventional rather than novel interface design. Our study suggests that tool design for advanced users must be closely aligned with needs that can be co-discovered with advanced users.",5

Towards Evaluating Exploratory Model Building Process with AutoML Systems,"Sungsoo Ray Hong, Sonia Castelo, Vito D'Orazio, Christopher Benthune, Aecio Santos, Scott Langevin, David Jonker, Enrico Bertini, Juliana Freire",2020/9/1,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.00449,"The use of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems are highly open-ended and exploratory. While rigorously evaluating how end-users interact with AutoML is crucial, establishing a robust evaluation methodology for such exploratory systems is challenging. First, AutoML is complex, including multiple sub-components that support a variety of sub-tasks for synthesizing ML pipelines, such as data preparation, problem specification, and model generation, making it difficult to yield insights that tell us which components were successful or not. Second, because the usage pattern of AutoML is highly exploratory, it is not possible to rely solely on widely used task efficiency and effectiveness metrics as success metrics. To tackle the challenges in evaluation, we propose an evaluation methodology that (1) guides AutoML builders to divide their AutoML system into multiple sub-system components, and (2) helps them reason about each component through visualization of end-users' behavioral patterns and attitudinal data. We conducted a study to understand when, how, why, and applying our methodology can help builders to better understand their systems and end-users.

Ambient, Ubiquitous and Intelligent Interaction","Remote controls are mainly used to control most of the CE devices in home environment these days. As the number of electronic devices increases in home, each device’s corresponding remote may also be added, and user frequently controls several devices at one time. This situation makes a user feel difficulty in finding desired remote control among many of other controllers. To alleviate this inconvenience, a technique for controlling multiple electronic devices with a single remote, well-known as a universal remote control technique, has attracted attention. Generally, when a user uses the universal remote control, she must input a key code of a desired device. If a user were to control several devices interchangeably, she may hang out pushing the key code for one device after the other. This kind of maneuver can be very tiresome, and it may lead to dropping the usability drastically. This paper propose the hardware, and software structure of Point and Control (PAC), which uses the metaphor of pointing a objective target, to select the device user intend to control. By using PAC, users can easily select and control the target device among many of candidates in real time with just simple behavior.",3

Interactive system for efficient video cartooning,"Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Jong-Chul Yoon, In-Kwon Lee, Siwoo Byun",2007/1/1,Conference MIRAGE 2007,"Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) can offer increased concentration and familiarity to the watcher. For this reason, many media such as movies, games, and commercials currently use the NPR method to deliver information. In this paper, we suggest an interactive system for video cartooning based on the mean-shift segmentation of image and video. In order to solve the problems of time complexity and memory allocation, the conventional problems of video mean-shift segmentation, this paper proposes several techniques such as foreground object based segmentation and sequential segmentation. We also propose the interactive correction technique to get enhanced results. For more cartoonic representation, we used spline curve approximation of segment boundaries in the final rendering results. With our method, we can easily create cartoon rendering output using the video streams such like home …",2
Going Beyond XAI: A Systematic Survey for Explanation-Guided Learning,"Yuyang Gao, Siyi Gu, Junji Jiang, Sungsoo Ray Hong, Dazhou Yu, Liang Zhao",2022/12/7,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.03954,"As the societal impact of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) grows, the goals for advancing DNNs become more complex and diverse, ranging from improving a conventional model accuracy metric to infusing advanced human virtues such as fairness, accountability, transparency (FaccT), and unbiasedness. Recently, techniques in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are attracting considerable attention, and have tremendously helped Machine Learning (ML) engineers in understanding AI models. However, at the same time, we started to witness the emerging need beyond XAI among AI communities; based on the insights learned from XAI, how can we better empower ML engineers in steering their DNNs so that the model's reasonableness and performance can be improved as intended? This article provides a timely and extensive literature overview of the field Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL), a domain of techniques that steer the DNNs' reasoning process by adding regularization, supervision, or intervention on model explanations. In doing so, we first provide a formal definition of EGL and its general learning paradigm. Secondly, an overview of the key factors for EGL evaluation, as well as summarization and categorization of existing evaluation procedures and metrics for EGL are provided. Finally, the current and potential future application areas and directions of EGL are discussed, and an extensive experimental study is presented aiming at providing comprehensive comparative studies among existing EGL models in various popular application domains, such as Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains.",1
Supporting Collaborative Sequencing of Small Groups through Visual Awareness,"Tae Soo Kim, Nitesh Goyal, Jeongyeon Kim, Juho Kim, Sungsoo Ray Hong",2021/4/22,Journal Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,"Collaborative Sequencing (CoSeq) is the process by which a group collaboratively constructs a sequence. CoSeq is ubiquitous, occurring across diverse situations like trip planning, course scheduling, or book writing. Building a consensus on a sequence is desirable to groups. However, accomplishing this requires groups to dedicate significant effort to comprehensively discuss preferences and resolve conflicts. Furthermore, as numerous decisions must be assessed to construct a sequence, this challenge can be exacerbated in CoSeq. However, little research has aimed to effectively support consensus building in CoSeq. As a first step to systematically understand and support consensus building in CoSeq, we conducted a formative study to gain insights into how visual awareness may facilitate the holistic recognition of preferences and the resolution of conflicts within a group. From the study, we identified design …",1
Understanding the role of user interface for multi-criteria decision-making in supporting exploratory usage of information systems,"Sungsoo Ray Hong, Rafal Kocilenik, Cecilia Aragon, Sarah Battersby, Juho Kim",2021/1/5,"Description dc. description. abstract Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) is one of the essential tasks people encounter in their everyday use of information systems. In MCDM, people weigh the relative importance of multiple decision criteria to assess decision candidates. Such an MCDM task is ubiquitous yet can be cognitively taxing without the explicit support of user interfaces (UIs). However, there has been a lack of approaches aiming at systemically understanding how the design of UIs can affect users' attitudes and behavior in performing their exploratory use of information systems under MCDM scenarios. To better understand the role of UIs in MCDM, we determine two factors in characterizing UI for MCDM;(1) the internal representation, the way that UI frames end-users in determining preferences of decision criteria (ie, individual, proportional, and pairwise quantifies), and (2) the external representation, the way that UI externalizes user preferences while the users interact with systems (1D and 2D layouts). We conducted two studies to understand how different design choices affect users' MCDM processes. We found 2D layout improves a set of attitudinal aspects in MCDM scenarios while using different quantifiers introduces a set of trade-offs.","dc. description. abstract Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) is one of the essential tasks people encounter in their everyday use of information systems.

Consensus Building in Collaborative Sequencing with Visual Awareness,"Tae Soo Kim, Sungsoo Hong, Nitesh Goyal, Jeongyeon Kim, Juho Kim",2020/4/25,Book Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"Collaborative Sequencing (CoSeq) is the process by which a group selects and arranges a set of items into a particular order. CoSeq is ubiquitous, occurring across diverse situations like trip planning or course scheduling. Although indicating preferences, communicating, and consensus building in CoSeq can be overwhelming for groups, little research has aimed at effectively supporting this process. To understand the design space of CoSeq, we ran a formative study to observe how participants utilize visualizations to strategically reduce their cognitive burden. We derived a novel design to enable sequence comparison using visualizations and evaluated its effect through a study. We found that attitudinal measures for the efficiency and effectiveness of the consensus building process were significantly improved with our design.",1

However, social media data are usually messy, disorganized, and noisy, which makes finding patterns in such data a challenging task. Visualization can help with the exploration of such massive data. Researchers studying social media often begin by reviewing related research. In this paper, we consider the idea that information from related research can be incorporated into social media visualization tools in order to spark creativity and guide exploration. To develop an effective overview of social media research with which to seed our tool, we conducted a content analysis of social media related papers and designed SparQs, a visual analytics tool to spark creativity in social media exploration.
