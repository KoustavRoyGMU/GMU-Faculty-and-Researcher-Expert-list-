Hippocampome. org: a knowledge base of neuron types in the rodent hippocampus,"Diek W Wheeler, Charise M White, Christopher L Rees, Alexander O Komendantov, David J Hamilton, Giorgio A Ascoli",2015/9/24,Journal Elife,"Hippocampome.org is a comprehensive knowledge base of neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex). Although the hippocampal literature is remarkably information-rich, neuron properties are often reported with incompletely defined and notoriously inconsistent terminology, creating a formidable challenge for data integration. Our extensive literature mining and data reconciliation identified 122 neuron types based on neurotransmitter, axonal and dendritic patterns, synaptic specificity, electrophysiology, and molecular biomarkers. All ∼3700 annotated properties are individually supported by specific evidence (∼14,000 pieces) in peer-reviewed publications. Systematic analysis of this unprecedented amount of machine-readable information reveals novel correlations among neuron types and properties, the potential connectivity of the full hippocampal circuitry, and outstanding knowledge gaps. User-friendly browsing and online querying of Hippocampome.org may aid design and interpretation of both experiments and simulations. This powerful, simple, and extensible neuron classification endeavor is unique in its detail, utility, and completeness.",133
Brightness induction: rate enhancement and neuronal synchronization as complementary codes,"Julia Biederlack, Miguel Castelo-Branco, Sergio Neuenschwander, Diek W Wheeler, Wolf Singer, Danko Nikolić",2006/12/21,Journal Neuron,"In cat visual cortex, we investigated with parallel recordings from multiple units the neuronal correlates of perceived brightness. The perceived brightness of a center grating was changed by varying the orientation or the relative spatial phase of a surrounding grating. Brightness enhancement by orientation contrast is associated with an increase of discharge rates of responses to the center grating but not with changes in spike synchronization. In contrast, if brightness enhancement is induced by phase offset, discharge rates are unchanged but synchronization increases between neurons responding to the center grating. The changes in synchronization correlate well with changes in perceived brightness that were assessed in parallel in human subjects using the same stimuli. These results indicate that in cerebral cortex the modulation of synchronicity of responses is used as a mechanism complementary to rate …",116
NeuroXidence: reliable and efficient analysis of an excess or deficiency of joint-spike events,"Gordon Pipa, Diek W Wheeler, Wolf Singer, Danko Nikolić",2008/8/1,Journal Journal of computational neuroscience,"We present a non-parametric and computationally efficient method named NeuroXidence that detects coordinated firing of two or more neurons and tests whether the observed level of coordinated firing is significantly different from that expected by chance.

Estimating use-dependent synaptic gain in autonomic ganglia by computational simulation and dynamic-clamp analysis,"Diek W Wheeler, Paul HM Kullmann, John P Horn",2004/11,Journal Journal of neurophysiology,"Biological gain mechanisms regulate the sensitivity and dynamics of signaling pathways at the systemic, cellular, and molecular levels.

Name-calling in the hippocampus (and beyond): coming to terms with neuron types and properties,"David J Hamilton, DW Wheeler, CM White, CL Rees, Alexander O Komendantov, Maurizio Bergamino, Giorgio A Ascoli",2017/3/1,Journal Brain informatics,"Widely spread naming inconsistencies in neuroscience pose a vexing obstacle to effective communication within and across areas of expertise. This problem is particularly acute when identifying neuron types and their properties. Hippocampome.org is a web-accessible neuroinformatics resource that organizes existing data about essential properties of all known neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation. Hippocampome.org links evidence supporting the assignment of a property to a type with direct pointers to quotes and figures. Mining this knowledge from peer-reviewed reports reveals the troubling extent of terminological ambiguity and undefined terms. Examples span simple cases of using multiple synonyms and acronyms for the same molecular biomarkers (or other property) to more complex cases of neuronal naming. New publications often use different terms without mapping them to previous terms. As a result, neurons of the same type are assigned disparate names, while neurons of different types are bestowed the same name. Furthermore, non-unique properties are frequently used as names, and several neuron types are not named at all. In order to alleviate this nomenclature confusion regarding hippocampal neuron types and properties, we introduce a new functionality of Hippocampome.org: a fully searchable, curated catalog of human and machine-readable definitions, each linked to the corresponding neuron and property terms. Furthermore, we extend our robust approach to providing each neuron type with an informative name and unique identifier by mapping all encountered synonyms and homonyms.",30
Quantitative firing pattern phenotyping of hippocampal neuron types,"Alexander O Komendantov, Siva Venkadesh, Christopher L Rees, Diek W Wheeler, David J Hamilton, Giorgio A Ascoli",2019/11/29,Journal Scientific Reports,"Systematically organizing the anatomical, molecular, and physiological properties of cortical neurons is important for understanding their computational functions.

A model for pleiotropic muscarinic potentiation of fast synaptic transmission,"Hermann Schobesberger, Diek W Wheeler, John P Horn",2000/4/1,Journal Journal of neurophysiology,The predominant form of muscarinic excitation in the forebrain and in sympathetic ganglia arises from m1 receptors coupled to the Gq/11 signal transduction pathway. Functional components of this system have been most completely mapped in frog sympathetic B neurons. Presynaptic stimulation of the B neuron produces a dual-component muscarinic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) mediated by suppression of voltage-dependent M-type K+ channels and activation of a voltage-insensitive cation current. Evidence from mammalian systems suggests that the cation current is mediated by cyclic GMP-gated channels. This paper describes the use of a computational model to analyze the consequences of pleiotropic muscarinic signaling for synaptic integration. The results show that the resting potential of B neurons is a logarithmic function of the leak conductance over a broad range of experimentally …,25

The situation is not dissimilar to the state of Chemistry prior to Mendeleev's tabulation of the elements. We propose that the patterns of presence or absence of axons and dendrites within known anatomical parcels may serve as the key principle to define neuron types. Just as the positions of the elements in the periodic table indicate their potential to combine into molecules, axonal and dendritic distributions provide the blueprint for network connectivity. Furthermore, among the features commonly employed to describe neurons, morphology is considerably robust to experimental conditions.

Simple models of quantitative firing phenotypes in hippocampal neurons: Comprehensive coverage of intrinsic diversity,"Siva Venkadesh, Alexander O Komendantov, Diek W Wheeler, David J Hamilton, Giorgio A Ascoli",2019/10/28,Journal PLoS computational biology,"Patterns of periodic voltage spikes elicited by a neuron help define its dynamical identity. Experimentally recorded spike trains from various neurons show qualitatively distinguishable features such as delayed spiking, spiking with or without frequency adaptation, and intrinsic bursting. Moreover, the input-dependent responses of a neuron not only show different quantitative features, such as higher spike frequency for a stronger input current injection, but can also exhibit qualitatively different responses, such as spiking and bursting under different input conditions, thus forming a complex phenotype of responses. In previous work, the comprehensive knowledge base of hippocampal neuron types Hippocampome.org systematically characterized various spike pattern phenotypes experimentally identified from 120 neuron types/subtypes. In this paper, we present a complete set of simple phenomenological models that quantitatively reproduce the diverse and complex phenotypes of hippocampal neurons. In addition to point-neuron models, we created compact multi-compartment models with up to four compartments, which will allow spatial segregation of synaptic integration in network simulations. Electrotonic compartmentalization observed in our compact multi-compartment models is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations.

Application to recordings in prefrontal cortex of two monkeys revealed that locking of spikes was differentially modulated with two different frequency bands depending on behavioral performance.",19
Molecular fingerprinting of principal neurons in the rodent hippocampus: A neuroinformatics approach,"DJ Hamilton, CM White, CL Rees, DW Wheeler, GA Ascoli",2017/9/10,Journal Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,"Neurons are often classified by their morphological and molecular properties.

Here, we mined literature to search for information regarding the phase-timing dynamics of over 100 hippocampal/entorhinal neuron types defined in Hippocampome.org. We identified missing and unresolved pieces of knowledge (e.g., the preferred theta phase for a specific neuron type) and complemented the dataset with our own new data.

Entrainment control in a noisy neural system,"Diek W Wheeler, WC Schieve",2003/4/25,Journal Physical Review E,"The open-plus-closed-loop (OPCL) entrainment control put forth by Jackson and Grosu [Physica D 85, 1 (1995)] is applied to an effective-neuron system as a way to extract stable limit cycles from a chaotic attractor, analogous to the retrieval of memories from a memory searching state. Additive Gaussian white noise, representing the natural noise inherent in any real dynamical system, is added to the entrainment control mechanism. Moderate levels of additive noise have little effect on successful entrainment, as reflected in phase-space plots and Lyapunov exponents. All three Lyapunov exponents are negative, which suggests parallels between OPCL control and chaotic synchronization.",4

Single-unit recordings revisited: Activity in recurrent microcircuits,"Raul C Mureşan, Gordon Pipa, Diek W Wheeler",2005/9/11,Conference International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks,"We investigated the relevance of single-unit recordings in the context of dynamical neural systems with recurrent synapses. The present study focuses on modeling a relatively small, biologically-plausible network of neurons. In the absence of any input, the network activity is self-sustained due to the resonating properties of the neurons. Recording of single units reveals an increasingly complex response to stimulation as one proceeds higher into the processing stream hierarchy. Results suggest that classical analysis methods, using rate and averaging over time, fail to describe the dynamics of the system, and instead hide the relevant information embedded in the complex states of the network. We conclude that single-unit recordings, which are still extensively used in experimental neuroscience, need to be more carefully interpreted.",3

First published June 22, 2004; 10.1152/jn. 00470.2004. Biological gain mechanisms regulate the sensitivity and dynamics of signaling pathways at the systemic, cellular, and molecular levels. In the sympathetic nervous system, gain in sensorymotor feedback loops is essential for homeostatic regulation of blood pressure and body temperature. This study shows how synaptic convergence and plasticity can interact to generate synaptic gain in autonomic ganglia and thereby enhance homeostatic control. Using a conductance-based computational model of an idealized sympathetic neuron, we simulated the postganglionic response to noisy patterns of presynaptic activity and found that a threefold amplification in postsynaptic spike output can arise in ganglia, depending on the number and strength of nicotinic synapses, the presynaptic firing rate, the extent of presynaptic facilitation, and the expression of muscarinic and peptidergic excitation. The simulations also showed that postsynaptic refractory periods serve to limit synaptic gain and alter postsynaptic spike timing. Synaptic gain was measured by stimulating dissociated bullfrog sympathetic neurons with 1–10 virtual synapses using a dynamic clamp. As in simulations, the threshold synaptic conductance for nicotinic excitation of firing was typically 10–15 nS, and synaptic gain increased with higher levels of nicotinic convergence. Unlike the model, gain in neurons sometimes declined during stimulation. This postsynaptic effect was …",
