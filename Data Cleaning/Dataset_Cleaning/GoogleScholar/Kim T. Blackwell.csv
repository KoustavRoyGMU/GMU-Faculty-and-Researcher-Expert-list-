Modelling the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity using systems biology approaches,"Jeanette Hellgren Kotaleski, Kim T Blackwell",2010/4,Source Nature Reviews Neuroscience,"Synaptic plasticity is thought to underlie learning and memory, but the complexity of the interactions between the ion channels, enzymes and genes that are involved in synaptic plasticity impedes a deep understanding of this phenomenon. Computer modelling has been used to investigate the information processing that is performed by the signalling pathways involved in synaptic plasticity in principal neurons of the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum. In the past few years, new software developments that combine computational neuroscience techniques with systems biology techniques have allowed large-scale, kinetic models of the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation and long-term depression. We highlight important advancements produced by these quantitative modelling efforts and introduce promising approaches that use advancements in live-cell imaging.",212
Transient calcium and dopamine increase PKA activity and DARPP-32 phosphorylation,"Maria Lindskog, MyungSook Kim, Martin A Wikström, Kim T Blackwell, Jeanette Hellgren Kotaleski",2006/9,Journal PLoS computational biology,"Reinforcement learning theorizes that strengthening of synaptic connections in medium spiny neurons of the striatum occurs when glutamatergic input (from cortex) and dopaminergic input (from substantia nigra) are received simultaneously. Subsequent to learning, medium spiny neurons with strengthened synapses are more likely to fire in response to cortical input alone. This synaptic plasticity is produced by phosphorylation of AMPA receptors, caused by phosphorylation of various signalling molecules. A key signalling molecule is the phosphoprotein DARPP-32, highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons. DARPP-32 is regulated by several neurotransmitters through a complex network of intracellular signalling pathways involving cAMP (increased through dopamine stimulation) and calcium (increased through glutamate stimulation). Since DARPP-32 controls several kinases and phosphatases involved in striatal synaptic plasticity, understanding the interactions between cAMP and calcium, in particular the effect of transient stimuli on DARPP-32 phosphorylation, has major implications for understanding reinforcement learning. We developed a computer model of the biochemical reaction pathways involved in the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 on Thr34 and Thr75. Ordinary differential equations describing the biochemical reactions were implemented in a single compartment model using the software XPPAUT. Reaction rate constants were obtained from the biochemical literature. The first set of simulations using sustained elevations of dopamine and calcium produced phosphorylation levels of DARPP-32 similar to that measured …",132
The role of type 4 phosphodiesterases in generating microdomains of cAMP: large scale stochastic simulations,"Rodrigo F Oliveira, Anna Terrin, Giulietta Di Benedetto, Robert C Cannon, Wonryull Koh, MyungSook Kim, Manuela Zaccolo, Kim T Blackwell",2010/7/22,Journal PloS one,"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and its main effector Protein Kinase A (PKA) are critical for several aspects of neuronal function including synaptic plasticity. Specificity of synaptic plasticity requires that cAMP activates PKA in a highly localized manner despite the speed with which cAMP diffuses. Two mechanisms have been proposed to produce localized elevations in cAMP, known as microdomains: impeded diffusion, and high phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. This paper investigates the mechanism of localized cAMP signaling using a computational model of the biochemical network in the HEK293 cell, which is a subset of pathways involved in PKA-dependent synaptic plasticity. This biochemical network includes cAMP production, PKA activation, and cAMP degradation by PDE activity. The model is implemented in NeuroRD: novel, computationally efficient, stochastic reaction-diffusion software, and is constrained by intracellular cAMP dynamics that were determined experimentally by real-time imaging using an Epac-based FRET sensor (H30). The model reproduces the high concentration cAMP microdomain in the submembrane region, distinct from the lower concentration of cAMP in the cytosol. Simulations further demonstrate that generation of the cAMP microdomain requires a pool of PDE4D anchored in the cytosol and also requires PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PDE4D which increases its activity. The microdomain does not require impeded diffusion of cAMP, confirming that barriers are not required for microdomains. The simulations reported here further demonstrate the utility of the new stochastic reaction-diffusion algorithm for exploring …",122
Gap junctions between striatal fast-spiking interneurons regulate spiking activity and synchronization as a function of cortical activity,"Johannes Hjorth, Kim T Blackwell, Jeanette Hellgren Kotaleski",2009/4/22,Journal Journal of Neuroscience,"Striatal fast-spiking (FS) interneurons are interconnected by gap junctions into sparsely connected networks. As demonstrated for cortical FS interneurons, these gap junctions in the striatum may cause synchronized spiking, which would increase the influence that FS neurons have on spiking by the striatal medium spiny (MS) neurons. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is characterized by changes in synchrony or periodicity, thus gap junctions between FS interneurons may modulate synchrony and thereby influence behavior such as reward learning and motor control. To explore the roles of gap junctions on activity and spike synchronization in a striatal FS population, we built a network model of FS interneurons. Each FS connects to 30–40% of its neighbors, as found experimentally, and each FS interneuron in the network is activated by simulated corticostriatal synaptic inputs. Our simulations show that the …",113
Quantitative estimate of synaptic inputs to striatal neurons during up and down states in vitro,"Kim T Blackwell, Uwe Czubayko, Dietmar Plenz",2003/10/8,Journal Journal of Neuroscience,"Up states are prolonged membrane potential depolarizations critical for synaptic integration and action potential generation in cortical and striatal neurons. They commonly result from numerous concurrent synaptic inputs, whereas neurons reside in a down state when synaptic inputs are few. By quantifying the composition, frequency, and amplitude of synaptic inputs for both states, we provide important constraints for state transitions in striatal network dynamics.",98

A comparative voltage and current-clamp analysis of feedback and feedforward synaptic transmission in the striatal microcircuit in vitro,"Nicholas Gustafson, Elakkat Gireesh-Dharmaraj, Uwe Czubayko, Kim T Blackwell, Dietmar Plenz",2006/2,Journal Journal of neurophysiology,"Striatal spiny projection (SP) neurons control movement initiation by integrating cortical inputs and inhibiting basal ganglia outputs. Central to this control lies a “microcircuit” that consists of a feedback pathway formed by axon collaterals between GABAergic SP neurons and a feedforward pathway from fast spiking (FS) GABAergic interneurons to SP neurons. Here, somatically evoked postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) and currents (PSCs) were compared for both pathways with dual whole cell patch recording in voltage- and current-clamp mode using cortex-striatum-substantia nigra organotypic cultures.

Pattern-recognition by an artificial network derived from biologic neuronal systems,"Daniel L Alkon, KT Blackwell, GS Barbour, AK Rigler, TP Vogl",1990/3,Journal Biological Cybernetics,"A novel artificial neural network, derived from neurobiological observations, is described and examples of its performance are presented. This DYnamically STable Associative Learning (DYSTAL) network associatively learns both correlations and anticorrelations, and can be configured to classify or restore patterns with only a change in the number of output units. DYSTAL exhibits some particularly desirable properties: computational effort scales linearly with the number of connections, i.e., it is0(N) in complexity; performance of the network is stable with respect to network parameters over wide ranges of their values and over the size of the input field; storage of a very large number of patterns is possible; patterns need not be orthogonal; network connections are not restricted to multi-layer feed-forward or any other specific structure; and, for a known set of deterministic input patterns, the network weights can …",88
"Calcium: amplitude, duration, or location?","RC Evans, KT Blackwell",2015/2,Source The Biological Bulletin,"Calcium plays a role in long-term plasticity by triggering postsynaptic signaling pathways for both the strengthening (LTP) and weakening (LTD) of synapses. Since these are opposing processes, several hypotheses have been developed to explain how calcium can trigger LTP in some situations and LTD in others. These hypotheses fall broadly into three categories, based on the amplitude of calcium concentration, the duration of the calcium elevation, and the location of the calcium influx. Here we review the experimental evidence for and against each of these hypotheses and the recent computational models utilizing each. We argue that with new experimental techniques for the precise visualization of calcium and new computational techniques for the modeling of calcium diffusion, it is time to take a new look at the location hypothesis.",70
S top! border ahead: A utomatic detection of subthalamic exit during deep brain stimulation surgery,"Dan Valsky, Odeya Marmor‐Levin, Marc Deffains, Renana Eitan, Kim T Blackwell, Hagai Bergman, Zvi Israel",2017/1,Journal Movement Disorders,"Microelectrode recordings along preplanned trajectories are often used for accurate definition of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) borders during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for Parkinson's disease. Usually, the demarcation of the STN borders is performed manually by a neurophysiologist. The exact detection of the borders is difficult, especially detecting the transition between the STN and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Consequently, demarcation may be inaccurate, leading to suboptimal location of the DBS lead and inadequate clinical outcomes.",66
Postsynaptic signal transduction models for long-term potentiation and depression,"Tiina Manninen, Katri Hituri, Jeanette Hellgren Kotaleski, Kim T Blackwell, Marja-Leena Linne",2010/12/13,Source Frontiers in computational neuroscience,"More than a hundred biochemical species, activated by neurotransmitters binding to transmembrane receptors, are important in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). To investigate which species and interactions are critical for synaptic plasticity, many computational postsynaptic signal transduction models have been developed. The models range from simple models with a single reversible reaction to detailed models with several hundred kinetic reactions. In this study, more than a hundred models are reviewed, and their features are compared and contrasted so that similarities and differences are more readily apparent. The models are classified according to the type of synaptic plasticity that is modeled (LTP or LTD) and whether they include diffusion or electrophysiological phenomena. Other characteristics that discriminate the models include the phase of synaptic plasticity modeled (induction, expression, or maintenance) and the simulation method used (deterministic or stochastic). We find that models are becoming increasingly sophisticated, by including stochastic properties, integrating with electrophysiological properties of entire neurons, or incorporating diffusion of signaling molecules. Simpler models continue to be developed because they are computationally efficient and allow theoretical analysis. The more complex models permit investigation of mechanisms underlying specific properties and experimental verification of model predictions. Nonetheless, it is difficult to fully comprehend the evolution of these models because (1) several models are not described in detail in the publications, (2) only a few models …",66
The effects of NMDA subunit composition on calcium influx and spike timing-dependent plasticity in striatal medium spiny neurons,"Rebekah C Evans, Teresa Morera-Herreras, Yihui Cui, Kai Du, Tom Sheehan, Jeanette Hellgren Kotaleski, Laurent Venance, Kim T Blackwell",2012/4/19,Journal PLoS computational biology,"Calcium through NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is necessary for the long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength; however, NMDARs differ in several properties that can influence the amount of calcium influx into the spine. These properties, such as sensitivity to magnesium block and conductance decay kinetics, change the receptor's response to spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) protocols, and thereby shape synaptic integration and information processing. This study investigates the role of GluN2 subunit differences on spine calcium concentration during several STDP protocols in a model of a striatal medium spiny projection neuron (MSPN). The multi-compartment, multi-channel model exhibits firing frequency, spike width, and latency to first spike similar to current clamp data from mouse dorsal striatum MSPN. We find that NMDAR-mediated calcium is dependent on GluN2 subunit type, action potential timing, duration of somatic depolarization, and number of action potentials. Furthermore, the model demonstrates that in MSPNs, GluN2A and GluN2B control which STDP intervals allow for substantial calcium elevation in spines. The model predicts that blocking GluN2B subunits would modulate the range of intervals that cause long term potentiation. We confirmed this prediction experimentally, demonstrating that blocking GluN2B in the striatum, narrows the range of STDP intervals that cause long term potentiation. This ability of the GluN2 subunit to modulate the shape of the STDP curve could underlie the role that GluN2 subunits play in learning and development.",65

Temporal sensitivity of protein kinase a activation in late-phase long term potentiation,"MyungSook Kim, Ted Huang, Ted Abel, Kim T Blackwell",2010/2/26,Journal PLoS computational biology,"Protein kinases play critical roles in learning and memory and in long term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity. The induction of late-phase LTP (L-LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus requires several kinases, including CaMKII and PKA, which are activated by calcium-dependent signaling processes and other intracellular signaling pathways. The requirement for PKA is limited to L-LTP induced using spaced stimuli, but not massed stimuli. To investigate this temporal sensitivity of PKA, a computational biochemical model of L-LTP induction in CA1 pyramidal neurons was developed. The model describes the interactions of calcium and cAMP signaling pathways and is based on published biochemical measurements of two key synaptic signaling molecules, PKA and CaMKII. The model is stimulated using four 100 Hz tetani separated by 3 sec (massed) or 300 sec (spaced), identical to experimental L-LTP induction protocols. Simulations show that spaced stimulation activates more PKA than massed stimulation, and makes a key experimental prediction, that L-LTP is PKA-dependent for intervals larger than 60 sec. Experimental measurements of L-LTP demonstrate that intervals of 80 sec, but not 40 sec, produce PKA-dependent L-LTP, thereby confirming the model prediction. Examination of CaMKII reveals that its temporal sensitivity is opposite that of PKA, suggesting that PKA is required after spaced stimulation to compensate for a decrease in CaMKII. In addition to explaining the temporal sensitivity of PKA, these simulations suggest that the use of several kinases for memory storage allows each to respond optimally to different …",63
A new approach to hand-written character recognition,"Kim T Blackwell, Thomas P Vogl, SD Hyman, Garth S Barbour, Daniel L Alkon",1992/6/1,Journal Pattern Recognition,"A novel, biologically motivated, computationally efficient approach to the classification of hand-written characters is described.

Similar training on hand-printed Kanji characters results in learning to read 40 people's handprinting of 160 characters to 99.8% accuracy (a task analogous to learning the latin characters in 40 different fonts) and reading different people's handprinting with 90% accuracy.",62
Colocalization of protein kinase A with adenylyl cyclase enhances protein kinase A activity during induction of long-lasting long-term-potentiation,"Myungsook Kim, Alan Jung Park, Robbert Havekes, Andrew Chay, Leonardo Antonio Guercio, Rodrigo Freire Oliveira, Ted Abel, Kim T Blackwell",2011/6/30,Journal PLoS computational biology,"The ability of neurons to differentially respond to specific temporal and spatial input patterns underlies information storage in neural circuits. One means of achieving spatial specificity is to restrict signaling molecules to particular subcellular compartments using anchoring molecules such as A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). Disruption of protein kinase A (PKA) anchoring to AKAPs impairs a PKA-dependent form of long term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. To investigate the role of localized PKA signaling in LTP, we developed a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of the signaling pathways leading to PKA activation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Simulations investigated whether the role of anchoring is to locate kinases near molecules that activate them, or near their target molecules. The results show that anchoring PKA with adenylyl cyclase (which produces cAMP that activates PKA) produces significantly greater PKA activity, and phosphorylation of both inhibitor-1 and AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit on S845, than when PKA is anchored apart from adenylyl cyclase. The spatial microdomain of cAMP was smaller than that of PKA suggesting that anchoring PKA near its source of cAMP is critical because inactivation by phosphodiesterase limits diffusion of cAMP. The prediction that the role of anchoring is to colocalize PKA near adenylyl cyclase was confirmed by experimentally rescuing the deficit in LTP produced by disruption of PKA anchoring using phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Additional experiments confirm the model prediction that disruption of anchoring impairs S845 phosphorylation produced by forskolin-induced synaptic …",60
Subcellular location of PKA controls striatal plasticity: stochastic simulations in spiny dendrites,"Rodrigo F Oliveira, MyungSook Kim, Kim T Blackwell",2012/2/9,Journal PLoS computational biology,"Dopamine release in the striatum has been implicated in various forms of reward dependent learning. Dopamine leads to production of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which are involved in striatal synaptic plasticity and learning. PKA and its protein targets are not diffusely located throughout the neuron, but are confined to various subcellular compartments by anchoring molecules such as A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). Experiments have shown that blocking the interaction of PKA with AKAPs disrupts its subcellular location and prevents LTP in the hippocampus and striatum; however, these experiments have not revealed whether the critical function of anchoring is to locate PKA near the cAMP that activates it or near its targets, such as AMPA receptors located in the post-synaptic density. We have developed a large scale stochastic reaction-diffusion model of signaling pathways in a medium spiny projection neuron dendrite with spines, based on published biochemical measurements, to investigate this question and to evaluate whether dopamine signaling exhibits spatial specificity post-synaptically. The model was stimulated with dopamine pulses mimicking those recorded in response to reward. Simulations show that PKA colocalization with adenylate cyclase, either in the spine head or in the dendrite, leads to greater phosphorylation of DARPP-32 Thr34 and AMPA receptor GluA1 Ser845 than when PKA is anchored away from adenylate cyclase. Simulations further demonstrate that though cAMP exhibits a strong spatial gradient, diffusible DARPP-32 facilitates the spread of PKA activity, suggesting that additional …",52
The effect of white and filtered noise on contrast detection thresholds,Kim T Blackwell,1998/1/1,Journal Vision Research,"Models of the dipper effect seen in contrast discrimination experiments predict that small amounts of noise should facilitate detection of a subthreshold sinusoidal grating. Although facilitation of chromatic sine waves has been measured with chromatic or luminance noise, a facilitory effect of luminance sinusoidal gratings has not been measured, most likely because the stimulus characteristics were not tuned for revealing facilitation. The present study measures contrast detection thresholds (CDTs) of sinusoidal gratings in two-dimensional, static, band-limited white noise and low-pass and high-pass filtered noise using a two-interval forced-choice paradigm. The results show facilitation in near threshold white noise of middle frequency sinusoidal gratings, and facilitation in filtered noise of sinusoidal gratings whose frequency is far outside the pass band of the noise. Based on these results, a model of contrast …",52
Synchronized firing of fast-spiking interneurons is critical to maintain balanced firing between direct and indirect pathway neurons of the striatum,"Sriraman Damodaran, Rebekah C Evans, Kim T Blackwell",2014/2/15,Journal Journal of neurophysiology,"The inhibitory circuits of the striatum are known to be critical for motor function, yet their contributions to Parkinsonian motor deficits are not clear. Altered firing in the globus pallidus suggests that striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the direct (D1 MSN) and indirect pathway (D2 MSN) are imbalanced during dopamine depletion. Both MSN classes receive inhibitory input from each other and from inhibitory interneurons within the striatum, specifically the fast-spiking interneurons (FSI). To investigate the role of inhibition in maintaining striatal balance, we developed a biologically-realistic striatal network model consisting of multicompartmental neuron models: 500 D1 MSNs, 500 D2 MSNs and 49 FSIs.

Ryanodine receptor modulation of in vitro associative learning in Hermissenda crassicornis,"Kim T Blackwell, Daniel L Alkon",1999/3/20,Journal Brain research,"Classical conditioning of the mollusc, Hermissenda crassicornis, is a model system used to study cellular correlates of associative learning. Paired presentation of light and turbulence, but not unpaired presentations, causes Hermissenda to contract its foot in response to light alone. Intracellular recordings from the type B photoreceptors of the Hermissenda eye reveal a learning specific increase of input resistance, and a reduction of voltage-dependent potassium currents, both of which depend on an elevation of intracellular calcium. Two previously demonstrated sources of calcium are influx through voltage-dependent channels, and release of calcium from intracellular stores through the IP3 receptor channel. Both modeling studies and identification of memory-related genes using RNA fingerprinting suggest that a third source of calcium, release from intracellular stores through the ryanodine receptor, may be …",47
Modulation of spike-timing dependent plasticity: towards the inclusion of a third factor in computational models,"Alexandre Foncelle, Alexandre Mendes, Joanna Jędrzejewska-Szmek, Silvana Valtcheva, Hugues Berry, Kim T Blackwell, Laurent Venance",2018/7/3,Source Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience,"In spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) change in synaptic strength depends on the timing of pre- vs. postsynaptic spiking activity. Since STDP is in compliance with Hebb’s postulate, it is considered one of the major mechanisms of memory storage and recall. STDP comprises a system of two coincidence detectors with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation often posited as one of the main components. Numerous studies have unveiled a third component of this coincidence detection system, namely neuromodulation and glia activity shaping STDP. Even though dopaminergic control of STDP has most often been reported, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, nitric oxide (NO), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) also has been shown to effectively modulate STDP. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that astrocytes, via the release or uptake of glutamate, gate STDP expression. At the most fundamental level, the timing properties of STDP are expected to depend on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the underlying signaling pathways. However in most cases, due to technical limitations experiments grant only indirect access to these pathways. Computational models carefully constrained by experiments, allow for a better qualitative understanding of the molecular basis of STDP and its regulation by neuromodulators. Recently, computational models of calcium dynamics and signaling pathway molecules have started to explore STDP emergence in ex and in vivo-like conditions. These models are expected to reproduce better at least part of the complex modulation of STDP as an emergent property …",46
Sensitivity to theta-burst timing permits LTP in dorsal striatal adult brain slice,"Sarah L Hawes, Fawad Gillani, Rebekah C Evans, Elizabeth A Benkert, Kim T Blackwell",2013/11/1,Journal Journal of neurophysiology,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory afferents to the dorsal striatum likely occurs with learning to encode new skills and habits, yet corticostriatal LTP is challenging to evoke reliably in brain slice under physiological conditions. Here we test the hypothesis that stimulating striatal afferents with theta-burst timing, similar to recently reported in vivo temporal patterns corresponding to learning, evokes LTP. Recording from adult mouse brain slice extracellularly in 1 mM Mg2+, we find LTP in dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum is preferentially evoked by certain theta-burst patterns. In particular, we demonstrate that greater LTP is produced using moderate intraburst and high theta-range frequencies, and that pauses separating bursts of stimuli are critical for LTP induction. By altering temporal pattern alone, we illustrate the importance of burst-patterning for LTP induction and demonstrate that corticostriatal long-term …",46
Multimodal plasticity in dorsal striatum while learning a lateralized navigation task,"Sarah L Hawes, Rebekah C Evans, Benjamin A Unruh, Elizabeth E Benkert, Fawad Gillani, Theodore C Dumas, Kim T Blackwell",2015/7/22,Journal Journal of Neuroscience,"Growing evidence supports a critical role for the dorsal striatum in cognitive as well as motor control. Both lesions and in vivo recordings demonstrate a transition in the engaged dorsal striatal subregion, from dorsomedial to dorsolateral, as skill performance shifts from an attentive phase to a more automatic or habitual phase. What are the neural mechanisms supporting the cognitive and behavioral transitions in skill learning? To pursue this question, we used T-maze training during which rats transition from early, attentive (dorsomedial) to late habitual (dorsolateral) performance. Following early or late training, we performed the first direct comparison of bidirectional synaptic plasticity in striatal brain slices, and the first evaluation of striatal synaptic plasticity by hemisphere relative to a learned turn.

Desynchronization of fast-spiking interneurons reduces β-band oscillations and imbalance in firing in the dopamine-depleted striatum,"Sriraman Damodaran, John R Cressman, Zbigniew Jedrzejewski-Szmek, Kim T Blackwell",2015/1/21,Journal Journal of Neuroscience,"Oscillations in the β-band (8–30 Hz) that emerge in the output nuclei of the basal ganglia during Parkinson's disease, along with an imbalanced activation of the direct and indirect pathways, have been linked to the hypokinetic motor output associated with the disease. Although dopamine depletion causes a change in cellular and network properties in the striatum, it is unclear whether abnormal activity measured in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata is caused by abnormal striatal activity. Here we use a computational network model of medium spiny neurons (MSNs)—fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), based on data from several mammalian species, and find that robust β-band oscillations and imbalanced firing emerge from implementation of changes to cellular and circuit properties caused by dopamine depletion.

Approaches and tools for modeling signaling pathways and calcium dynamics in neurons,KT Blackwell,2013/11/15,Source Journal of neuroscience methods,"Signaling pathways are cascades of intracellular biochemical reactions that are activated by transmembrane receptors, and ultimately lead to transcription in the nucleus. In neurons, both calcium permeable synaptic and ionic channels as well as G protein coupled receptors initiate activation of signaling pathway molecules that interact with electrical activity at multiple spatial and time scales. At small temporal and spatial scales, calcium modifies the properties of ionic channels, whereas at larger temporal and spatial scales, various kinases and phosphatases modify the properties of ionic channels, producing phenomena such as synaptic plasticity and homeostatic plasticity. The elongated structure of neuronal dendrites and the organization of multi-protein complexes by anchoring proteins imply that the spatial dimension must be explicit.

Calcium dynamics predict direction of synaptic plasticity in striatal spiny projection neurons,"Joanna Jędrzejewska‐Szmek, Sriraman Damodaran, Daniel B Dorman, Kim T Blackwell",2017/4,Journal European Journal of Neuroscience,"The striatum is a major site of learning and memory formation for sensorimotor and cognitive association. One of the mechanisms used by the brain for memory storage is synaptic plasticity – the long‐lasting, activity‐dependent change in synaptic strength. All forms of synaptic plasticity require an elevation in intracellular calcium, and a common hypothesis is that the amplitude and duration of calcium transients can determine the direction of synaptic plasticity. The utility of this hypothesis in the striatum is unclear in part because dopamine is required for striatal plasticity and in part because of the diversity in stimulation protocols. To test whether calcium can predict plasticity direction, we developed a calcium‐based plasticity rule using a spiny projection neuron model with sophisticated calcium dynamics including calcium diffusion, buffering and pump extrusion.

Signaling pathways involved in striatal synaptic plasticity are sensitive to temporal pattern and exhibit spatial specificity,"BoHung Kim, Sarah L Hawes, Fawad Gillani, Lane J Wallace, Kim T Blackwell",2013/3/14,Journal PLoS computational biology,"The basal ganglia is a brain region critically involved in reinforcement learning and motor control. Synaptic plasticity in the striatum of the basal ganglia is a cellular mechanism implicated in learning and neuronal information processing. Therefore, understanding how different spatio-temporal patterns of synaptic input select for different types of plasticity is key to understanding learning mechanisms. In striatal medium spiny projection neurons (MSPN), both long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD) require an elevation in intracellular calcium concentration; however, it is unknown how the post-synaptic neuron discriminates between different patterns of calcium influx. Using computer modeling, we investigate the hypothesis that temporal pattern of stimulation can select for either endocannabinoid production (for LTD) or protein kinase C (PKC) activation (for LTP) in striatal MSPNs. We implement a stochastic model of the post-synaptic signaling pathways in a dendrite with one or more diffusionally coupled spines. The model is validated by comparison to experiments measuring endocannabinoid-dependent depolarization induced suppression of inhibition. Using the validated model, simulations demonstrate that theta burst stimulation, which produces LTP, increases the activation of PKC as compared to 20 Hz stimulation, which produces LTD. The model prediction that PKC activation is required for theta burst LTP is confirmed experimentally. Using the ratio of PKC to endocannabinoid production as an index of plasticity direction, model simulations demonstrate that LTP exhibits spine level spatial specificity, whereas LTD is more …",28
Dynamically stable associative learning neural system with one fixed weight,"Daniel L Alkon, Thomas P Vogl, Kim L Blackwell",1993/6/22,Patent office US,"A dynamically stable associative learning neural network system include a plurality of synapses (122, 22-28), a non-linear function circuit (30) and an adaptive weight circuit (150) for adjusting the weight of each synapse based upon the present signal and the prior history of signals applied to the input of the particular synapse and the present signal and the prior history of signals applied to the input of a predetermined set of other collateral synapses.

Modeling intracellular signaling underlying striatal function in health and disease,"Anu G Nair, Omar Gutierrez-Arenas, Olivia Eriksson, Alexandra Jauhiainen, Kim T Blackwell, Jeanette H Kotaleski",2014/1/1,Source Progress in molecular biology and translational science,"Striatum, which is the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, integrates cortical and thalamic glutamatergic inputs with dopaminergic afferents from the substantia nigra pars compacta. The combination of dopamine and glutamate strongly modulates molecular and cellular properties of striatal neurons and the strength of corticostriatal synapses. These actions are performed via intracellular signaling networks, containing several intertwined feedback loops. Understanding the role of dopamine and other neuromodulators requires the development of quantitative dynamical models for describing the intracellular signaling, in order to provide precise unambiguous descriptions and quantitative predictions.

Using potassium currents to solve signal-to-noise problems in inhibitory feedforward networks of the striatum,"J Hellgren Kotaleski, Dietmar Plenz, Kim T Blackwell",2006/1,Journal Journal of neurophysiology,"Fast-spiking (FS) interneurons provide the main route of feedforward inhibition from cortex to spiny projection neurons in the striatum. A steep current-firing frequency curve and a dense local axonal arbor suggest that even small excitatory inputs could translate into powerful feedforward inhibition, although such an arrangement is also sensitive to amplification of spurious synaptic inputs. We show that a transient potassium (KA) current allows the FS interneuron to strike a balance between sensitivity to correlated input and robustness to noise, thereby increasing its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). First, a compartmental FS neuron model was created to match experimental data from striatal FS interneurons in cortex–striatum–substantia nigra organotypic cultures.

β-adrenergic signaling broadly contributes to LTP induction,"Joanna Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek, Vincent Luczak, Ted Abel, Kim T Blackwell",2017/7/24,Journal PLoS computational biology,"Long-lasting forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) represent one of the major cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory. One of the fundamental questions in the field of LTP is why different molecules are critical for long-lasting forms of LTP induced by diverse experimental protocols. Further complexity stems from spatial aspects of signaling networks, such that some molecules function in the dendrite and some are critical in the spine. We investigated whether the diverse experimental evidence can be unified by creating a spatial, mechanistic model of multiple signaling pathways in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Our results show that the combination of activity of several key kinases can predict the occurrence of long-lasting forms of LTP for multiple experimental protocols. Specifically Ca2+/calmodulin activated kinase II, protein kinase A and exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac) together predict the occurrence of LTP in response to strong stimulation (multiple trains of 100 Hz) or weak stimulation augmented by isoproterenol. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that activation of the β-adrenergic receptor either via canonical (Gs-coupled) or non-canonical (Gi-coupled) pathways underpins most forms of long-lasting LTP. Simulations make the experimentally testable prediction that a complete antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptor will likely block long-lasting LTP in response to strong stimulation. Collectively these results suggest that converging molecular mechanisms allow CA1 neurons to flexibly utilize signaling mechanisms best tuned to temporal pattern of synaptic input to achieve long-lasting LTP and memory storage.",25
An efficient stochastic diffusion algorithm for modeling second messengers in dendrites and spines,Kim T Blackwell,2006/10/15,Journal Journal of neuroscience methods,"Intracellular signaling pathways, which encompass both biochemical reactions and second messenger diffusion, interact non-linearly with neuronal membrane properties in their role as essential intermediaries for synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. Computational modeling is a productive approach for investigating these phenomena; however, most current strategies for modeling neurons exclude signaling pathways. To overcome this deficiency, a new algorithm is presented to simulate stochastic diffusion in a highly efficient manner. The gain in speed is obtained by considering collections of molecules, instead of tracking the movement of individual molecules. The probability of a molecule leaving a spatially discrete compartment is used to create a lookup table that stores the probability of km molecules leaving the compartment as a function of the total number of molecules in the compartment.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) in patients with Parkinson’s disease and dystonia improves motor symptoms and quality of life. Traditionally, pallidal borders have been demarcated by electrophysiological microelectrode recordings (MERs) during DBS surgery. However, detection of pallidal borders can be challenging due to the variability of the firing characteristics of neurons encountered along the trajectory. MER can also be time-consuming and therefore costly. Here we show the feasibility of real-time machine learning classification of striato-pallidal borders to assist neurosurgeons during DBS surgery.

We built a biochemically detailed model of post-synaptic plasticity describing CaMKII, PKA, and PKC pathways and their contribution to synaptic potentiation or depression. We developed a statistical AMPA-receptor-tetramer model, which permits the estimation of the AMPA-receptor-mediated maximal synaptic conductance based on numbers of GluR1s and GluR2s predicted by the biochemical signalling model. We show that our model reproduces neuromodulator-gated spike-timing-dependent plasticity as observed in the visual cortex and can be fit to data from many cortical areas, uncovering the biochemical contributions of the pathways pinpointed by the underlying experimental studies.

Control of βAR- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Receptor-Dependent cAMP Dynamics in Hippocampal Neurons,"Andrew Chay, Ilaria Zamparo, Andreas Koschinski, Manuela Zaccolo, Kim T Blackwell",2016/2/22,Journal PLOS Computational Biology,"Norepinephrine, a neuromodulator that activates β-adrenergic receptors (βARs), facilitates learning and memory as well as the induction of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Several forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral CA1 synapse require stimulation of both βARs and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). To understand the mechanisms mediating the interactions between βAR and NMDAR signaling pathways, we combined FRET imaging of cAMP in hippocampal neuron cultures with spatial mechanistic modeling of signaling pathways in the CA1 pyramidal neuron. Previous work implied that cAMP is synergistically produced in the presence of the βAR agonist isoproterenol and intracellular calcium. In contrast, we show that when application of isoproterenol precedes application of NMDA by several minutes, as is typical of βAR-facilitated LTP experiments, the average amplitude of the cAMP response to NMDA is attenuated compared with the response to NMDA alone. Models simulations suggest that, although the negative feedback loop formed by cAMP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and type 4 phosphodiesterase may be involved in attenuating the cAMP response to NMDA, it is insufficient to explain the range of experimental observations. Instead, attenuation of the cAMP response requires mechanisms upstream of adenylyl cyclase. Our model demonstrates that Gs-to-Gi switching due to PKA phosphorylation of βARs as well as Gi inhibition of type 1 adenylyl cyclase may underlie the experimental observations. This suggests that signaling by β-adrenergic receptors depends on temporal pattern …",21
Modeling calcium concentration and biochemical reactions,Kim T Blackwell,2005/11/7,"Journal Brains, Minds, and Media [Internet]","Almost all regions of the brain receive one or more neuromodulatory inputs, and disrupting these inputs produces deficits in neuronal function. Neuromodulators act through intracellular second messenger pathways to influence the electrical properties of neurons, integration of synaptic inputs, spatio-temporal firing dynamics of neuronal networks, and, ultimately, systems behavior. Second messengers pathways consist of series of bimolecular reactions, enzymatic reactions, and diffusion. Calcium is the second messenger molecule with the most effectors, and thus is highly regulated by buffers, pumps and intracellular stores. Computational modeling provides an innovative, yet practical method to evaluate the spatial extent, time course and interaction among second messenger pathways, and the interaction of second messengers with neuron electrical properties. These processes occur both in compartments where the number of molecules are large enough to describe reactions deterministically (eg cell body), and in compartments where the number of molecules is small enough that reactions occur stochastically (eg spines).–In this tutorial, I explain how to develop models of second messenger pathways and calcium dynamics. The first part of the tutorial explains the equations used to model bimolecular reactions, enzyme reactions, calcium release channels, calcium pumps and diffusion.

Reconstructions of the patterns from the preprocessed versions are quite impressive. Preliminary results yield nearly 90% correct classification of exemplars of 40 different Kanji characters, and also indicate that reconstruction requires more information than classification.

Hermissenda learns to associate light with turbulence: prior to learning, naive animals move toward light (phototaxis) and contract their foot in response to turbulence; after learning, conditioned animals delay phototaxis in response to light. The photoreceptors of the eye, which receive monosynaptic inputs from statocyst hair cells, are both sensory neurons and the first site of sensory convergence.

Dynamic modulation of spike timing-dependent calcium influx during corticostriatal upstates,"Rebekah C Evans, Yash M Maniar, Kim T Blackwell",2013/10/1,Journal Journal of neurophysiology,"The striatum of the basal ganglia demonstrates distinctive upstate and downstate membrane potential oscillations during slow-wave sleep and under anesthetic.

Calcium is essential for synaptic plasticity in the striatum, and these large calcium transients during the upstates may control which synapses undergo plastic changes. To investigate the mechanisms that underlie the relationship between calcium and AP timing, we have developed a realistic biophysical model of a medium spiny neuron (MSN).

We show that dopamine oppositely shapes responses to convergent excitatory inputs in mouse striosome and matrix striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Activation of postsynaptic D1 dopamine receptors promoted the generation of long-lasting synaptically evoked “up-states” in matrix SPNs but opposed it in striosomes, which were more excitable under basal conditions.

Calcium waves and closure of potassium channels in response to GABA stimulation in Hermissenda type B photoreceptors,KT Blackwell,2002/2/1,Journal Journal of neurophysiology,"Classical conditioning of Hermissenda crassicornisrequires the paired presentation of a conditioned stimulus (light) and an unconditioned stimulus (turbulence). Light stimulation of photoreceptors leads to production of diacylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C, and inositol triphosphate (IP3), which releases calcium from intracellular stores. Turbulence causes hair cells to release GABA onto the terminal branches of the type B photoreceptor. One prior study has shown that GABA stimulation produces a wave of calcium that propagates from the terminal branches to the soma and raises the possibility that two sources of calcium are required for memory storage.

Since developing a biophysically realistic, single neuron model is exceedingly difficult, software has been developed for automatically adjusting parameters of computational neuronal models. The ideal optimization software should work with commonly used neural simulation software; thus, we present software which works with models specified in declarative format for the MOOSE simulator. Experimental data can be specified using one of two different file formats. The fitness function is customizable as a weighted combination of feature differences. The optimization itself uses the covariance matrix adaptation-evolutionary strategy, because it is robust in the face of local fluctuations of the fitness function, and deals well with a high-dimensional and discontinuous fitness landscape. We demonstrate the versatility of the software by creating several model examples of each of four types of neurons (two subtypes of spiny projection neurons and two subtypes of globus pallidus neurons) by tuning to current clamp data. Optimizations reached convergence within 1,600–4,000 model evaluations (200–500 generations × population size of 8).

Angular separation in neural networks,"John M Irvine, Kim T Blackwell, DL Alkon, TP Vogl",1994,Journal J. Artificial networks,"An important property of any neural network is its ability to distinguish between separate sets of inputs. This capability to separate input sets of various types determines the classes of problems the network can address in principle. The single layer perceptron is limited to problems which are linearly separable [1, 2]. It cannot, for example, solve the XOR problem. Similarly, a two-layer perceptron can sep-arate a convex set from its complement. Arbitrary sets, which can be approximated by finite unions and intersections of convex sets, are separable for three layer feed-forward perceptrons (3). These properties of separability follow from the fact that the sum of weighted inputs from a receptive field is the scalar quantity processed by the next layer. The network, in effect, separates the input space into sets determined by the hypersurfaces implied by the weights. An alternative theoretical basis for an artificial neural network is to aggregate the inputs by computing the “similarity” between a “learned” pattern and the inputs. We explore the theoretical properties of a two-layer inhomogeneous net-work which stores additional learned patterns as required (see Figure 1). The network uses some measure of similarity to compare the inputs to the learned pattern. Each node in the hidden layer contains a set of values that represent the patterns learned by the network. In the simplest case, the output of a neuron in the final layer will be the maximum (over all hidden units connected to that neuron) of the similarity between the input values and the learned values.

The effect of intensity and duration on the light-induced sodium and potassium currents in the Hermissenda type B photoreceptor,Kim T Blackwell,2002/5/15,Journal Journal of Neuroscience,"Light duration and intensity influence classical conditioning inHermissenda through their effects on the light-induced currents. Furthermore, the contribution of voltage-dependent potassium currents to the long-lasting depolarization in type B photoreceptors depends on light-induced currents active at resting potentials. Thus, the present study measures the effect of holding potential, duration, and intensity on the light-induced currents in discontinuous single-electrode voltage clamp mode. Three distinct current components are distinguished by their temporal and voltage characteristics and sensitivity to pharmacological agents. One current component is a transient sodium current, INalgt; another is a plateau sodium current,Iplateau, which persists for the duration of the light stimulus. Substitution of trimethylammonium chloride for sodium reduces both currents equally, suggesting thatIplateau represents partial …",10
Pattern matching in a model of dendritic spines,"Kim T Blackwell, TP Vogl, Daniel L Alkon",1998/2/1,Journal Network: Computation in Neural Systems,"Pattern matching, the ability to recognize and maximally respond to an input pattern that is similar to a previously learned pattern, is an essential step in any learning process. To investigate the properties of pattern matching in biological neurons, and in particular the role of a calcium-dependent potassium conductance, a circuit model of a small area of dendritic membrane with a number of dendritic spines is developed. Circuit model simulations show that dendritic membrane depolarization is greater in response to a previously learned pattern of synaptic inputs than in response to a novel pattern of synaptic inputs. These simulations, in combination with an analysis of the circuit model equations, reveal that when a synaptic input pattern is similar to the learned pattern of synaptic inputs, the total dendritic depolarization is a linear combination of dendritic depolarization contributed by individual spines.

Inhibition enhances spatially-specific calcium encoding of synaptic input patterns in a biologically constrained model,"Daniel B Dorman, Joanna Jędrzejewska-Szmek, Kim T Blackwell",2018/10/25,Journal Elife,"Synaptic plasticity, which underlies learning and memory, depends on calcium elevation in neurons, but the precise relationship between calcium and spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs is unclear. Here, we develop a biologically realistic computational model of striatal spiny projection neurons with sophisticated calcium dynamics, based on data from rodents of both sexes, to investigate how spatiotemporally clustered and distributed excitatory and inhibitory inputs affect spine calcium. We demonstrate that coordinated excitatory synaptic inputs evoke enhanced calcium elevation specific to stimulated spines, with lower but physiologically relevant calcium elevation in nearby non-stimulated spines. Results further show a novel and important function of inhibition—to enhance the difference in calcium between stimulated and non-stimulated spines. These findings suggest that spine calcium dynamics encode synaptic input patterns and may serve as a signal for both stimulus-specific potentiation and heterosynaptic depression, maintaining balanced activity in a dendritic branch while inducing pattern-specific plasticity.",9

Ionic currents underlying difference in light response between type A and type B photoreceptors,Kim T Blackwell,2006/5,Journal Journal of neurophysiology,"In Hermissenda crassicornis, the memory of light associated with turbulence is stored as changes in intrinsic and synaptic currents in both type A and type B photoreceptors. These photoreceptor types exhibit qualitatively different responses to light and current injection, and these differences shape the spatiotemporal firing patterns that control behavior. Thus the objective of the study was to identify the mechanisms underlying these differences. The approach was to develop a type B model that reproduced characteristics of type B photoreceptors recorded in vitro, and then to create a type A model by modifying a select number of ionic currents. Comparison of type A models with characteristics of type A photoreceptors recorded in vitro revealed that type A and type B photoreceptors have five main differences, three that have been characterized experimentally and two that constitute hypotheses to be tested with …",9

Dystal is an ANN which does not suffer this degradation. Dystal is an ANN based on properties of associative learning found in biological neural networks. To verify these theoretical properties of Dystal, the authors implement Dystal on MasPar, a massively parallel machine. They show that the execution time is independent of both the separability of the patterns and the number of output units, and that the training time is linear with the number of patterns in the training data set. That is, the number of iterations through the training set to achieve learning is small and independent of pattern content or training set size.< >",9
Calcium-dependent inactivation of calcium channels in the medial striatum increases at eye opening,"Rebekah C Evans, Greta Ann Herin, Sarah Louise Hawes, Kim T Blackwell",2015/4,Journal Journal of Neurophysiology,"Influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) is essential for striatal function and plasticity. VGCCs expressed in striatal neurons have varying kinetics, voltage dependences, and densities resulting in heterogeneous subcellular calcium dynamics. One factor that determines the calcium dynamics in striatal medium spiny neurons is inactivation of VGCCs. Aside from voltage-dependent inactivation, VGCCs undergo calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI): inactivating in response to an influx of calcium. CDI is a negative feedback control mechanism; however, its contribution to striatal neuron function is unknown. Furthermore, although the density of VGCC expression changes with development, it is unclear whether CDI changes with development.

Studies have demonstrated a requirement for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in L-LTP produced by a diversity of temporal stimulation patterns. Multiple signaling pathways converge to activate ERK, with different pathways being required for different stimulation patterns. To answer whether and how different temporal patterns select different signaling pathways for ERK activation, we developed a computational model of five signaling pathways (including two novel pathways) leading to ERK activation during L-LTP induction. We show that calcium and cAMP work synergistically to activate ERK and that stimuli given with large intertrial intervals activate more ERK than shorter intervals. Furthermore, these pathways contribute to different dynamics of ERK activation. These results suggest that signaling pathways with different temporal sensitivities facilitate ERK activation to diversity of temporal patterns.",7

To investigate sources of calcium elevation, a model of calcium dynamics in the photoreceptor was developed.

Typically, hypothesis-driven modeling brings a question into focus so that a model is constructed to investigate a specific hypothesis about how the system works or why certain phenomena are observed. Data-driven modeling, on the other hand, follows a more unbiased approach, with model construction informed by the computationally intensive use of data. At the same time, researchers employ models at different biological scales and at different levels of abstraction. Combining these models while validating them against experimental data increases understanding of the multiscale brain. However, a lack of interoperability, transparency, and reusability of both models and the workflows used to construct them creates barriers for the integration of models representing different biological scales and built using different modeling philosophies. We argue that the same imperatives that drive resources and policy for data – such as the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles – also support the integration of different modeling approaches. The FAIR principles require that data be shared in formats that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Applying these principles to models and modeling workflows, as well as the data used to constrain and validate them, would allow researchers to find, reuse, question, validate, and extend published models, regardless of whether they are implemented phenomenologically or mechanistically, as a few equations or as a multiscale, hierarchical system.

The model's output, membrane potential, an indirect measure of firing frequency, closely parallels the behavioral and electrophysiologic outputs of Hermissenda in response to the same input stimuli presented during and after associative learning. The parallelism of the computer modeled and the biologic outputs suggests that the model captures the features necessary and sufficient for associative learning.",24
Synaptic plasticity is predicted by spatiotemporal firing rate patterns and robust to in vivo-like variability,"Daniel B Dorman, Kim T Blackwell",2022/10/1,Journal Biomolecules,"Synaptic plasticity, the experience-induced change in connections between neurons, underlies learning and memory in the brain. Most of our understanding of synaptic plasticity derives from in vitro experiments with precisely repeated stimulus patterns; however, neurons exhibit significant variability in vivo during repeated experiences. Further, the spatial pattern of synaptic inputs to the dendritic tree influences synaptic plasticity, yet is not considered in most synaptic plasticity rules. Here, we investigate how spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns produce plasticity with in vivo-like conditions using a data-driven computational model with a plasticity rule based on calcium dynamics. Using in vivo spike train recordings as inputs to different size clusters of spines, we show that plasticity is strongly robust to trial-to-trial variability of spike timing. In addition, we derive general synaptic plasticity rules describing how spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs control the magnitude and direction of plasticity. Synapses that strongly potentiated have greater firing rates and calcium concentration later in the trial, whereas strongly depressing synapses have hiring firing rates early in the trial. The neighboring synaptic activity influences the direction and magnitude of synaptic plasticity, with small clusters of spines producing the greatest increase in synaptic strength. Together, our results reveal that calcium dynamics can unify diverse plasticity rules and reveal how spatiotemporal firing rate patterns control synaptic plasticity.",
"Protein Kinase C, Models of",Kim T Blackwell,2022/6/12,Book Encyclopedia of Computational Neuroscience,"How to answer this question? We first assume that the oscillation is a limit cycle–a trajectory through state space that is repeated reliably every cycle. The phase of a limit cycle, defined over an interval of 0–1 or 0–2π, describes the current state of the oscillator. A common example of this process is the second hand of a clock. The period of the oscillation (1 min) describes how long it takes for one complete traversal of the limit cycle; the phase is mapped to the location the second hand is currently pointing to. Assuming a limit cycle oscillation, we make a second assumption–perturbations to the oscillation move the state of an oscillator forward (advance) or backward (delay) along the limit cycle. The phase response curve (PRC) is a function that characterizes how the limit cycle is",

Prediction of Neural Diameter From Morphology to Enable Accurate Simulation,"Jonathan D Reed, Kim T Blackwell",2021/6/3,Journal Frontiers in Neuroinformatics,"Accurate neuron morphologies are paramount for computational model simulations of realistic neural responses. Over the last decade, the online repository NeuroMorpho.Org has collected over 140,000 available neuron morphologies to understand brain function and promote interaction between experimental and computational research. Neuron morphologies describe spatial aspects of neural structure; however, many of the available morphologies do not contain accurate diameters that are essential for computational simulations of electrical activity. To best utilize available neuron morphologies, we present a set of equations that predict dendritic diameter from other morphological features. To derive the equations, we used a set of NeuroMorpho.org archives with realistic neuron diameters, representing hippocampal pyramidal, cerebellar Purkinje, and striatal spiny projection neurons. Each morphology is separated into initial, branching children, and continuing nodes. Our analysis reveals that the diameter of preceding nodes, Parent Diameter, is correlated to diameter of subsequent nodes for all cell types. Branching children and initial nodes each required additional morphological features to predict diameter, such as path length to soma, total dendritic length, and longest path to terminal end. Model simulations reveal that membrane potential response with predicted diameters is similar to the original response for several tested morphologies. We provide our open source software to extend the utility of available NeuroMorpho.org morphologies, and suggest predictive equations may supplement morphologies that lack dendritic diameter and …",
Endocannabinoids and dopamine balance basal ganglia output,"Lilach Gorodetski, Yocheved Loewenstern, Anna Faynveitz, Izhar Bar-Gad, Kim T Blackwell, Alon Korngreen",2021/3/17,Journal Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,"The entopeduncular nucleus is one of the basal ganglia's output nuclei, thereby controlling basal ganglia information processing. Entopeduncular nucleus neurons integrate GABAergic inputs from the Striatum and the globus pallidus, together with glutamatergic inputs from the subthalamic nucleus. We show that endocannabinoids and dopamine interact to modulate the long-term plasticity of all these primary afferents to the entopeduncular nucleus. Our results suggest that the interplay between dopamine and endocannabinoids determines the balance between direct pathway (striatum) and indirect pathway (globus pallidus) in entopeduncular nucleus output. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, despite the lack of axon collaterals, information is transferred between neighboring neurons in the entopeduncular nucleus via endocannabinoid diffusion. These results transform the prevailing view of the entopeduncular nucleus as a feedforward “relay” nucleus to an intricate control unit, which may play a vital role in the process of action selection.",
Regulation of Axon Growth by Alpha 7 Nicotinic Receptor Calcium Transients at the Growth Cone,"E Bak, J Jedrzejewska-Szmek, J King, K Blackwell, N Kabbani",2017/2/3,Journal Biophysical Journal,"Cell surface receptors of the growth cone (GC) transmit extracellular information that is essential for synaptogenesis and proper brain wiring.

Molecular dependence of hippocampal bidirectional plasticity,"Joanna Jędrzejewska-Szmek, Andrew Chay, Kim T Blackwell",2014/7,Journal BMC Neuroscience,"Both CaMKII and PKA are activated by calcium bound calmodulin, CaMKII directly, and PKA indirectly via adenylyl cyclase production of cAMP. The adenylyl cyclase is also activated by stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptor (bAR). Curiously, not all forms of cAMP dependent LTP require PKA. Specifically, LTP induced with isoproterenol (ISO) bath application followed by 100 Hz stimulation is PKA independent [1, 2], whereas both ISO followed by 3 min of 5 Hz [2] and four trains of 100 Hz stimulation do require PKA [3]. Furthermore, recent experiments suggest a novel bAR signaling pathway, in which PKA phosphorylation prevents activation of G protein subtype s (Gs), and switches the bAR to the Gi subtype of G [4], leading to recruitment of another memory kinase: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). To investigate how temporal pattern of synaptic activation determines which signaling pathways are activated, we employed a multi-compartmental stochastic reactiondiffusion model of calcium and cAMP activated signaling pathways. We investigated two model variants, one which took into account only bARcoupling to Gs, and the other which included the novel switching pathway. We performed simulations of four trains of 100 Hz, and isoproterenol application followed by either 1 train of 100 Hz or 3 min of 5 Hz, all of which produce long lasting LTP. We also simulated 3 stimulation paradigms which do not produce LTP, including 1 Hz stimulation which produces LTD.",

Signaling Pathways Involved in Striatal Synaptic Plasticity are Sensitive to Temporal Pattern,"B Kim, SL Hawes, F Gillani, LJ Wallace, KT Blackwell",2013,Journal of this article was funded in part by the George Mason University Libraries Open Access Publishing Fund. The funders had no role in study design,"The basal ganglia is a brain region critically involved in reinforcement learning and motor control. Synaptic plasticity in the striatum of the basal ganglia is a cellular mechanism implicated in learning and neuronal information processing. Therefore, understanding how different spatio-temporal patterns of synaptic input select for different types of plasticity is key to understanding learning mechanisms. In striatal medium spiny projection neurons (MSPN), both long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD) require an elevation in intracellular calcium concentration; however, it is unknown how the post-synaptic neuron discriminates between different patterns of calcium influx. Using computer modeling, we investigate the hypothesis that temporal pattern of stimulation can select for either endocannabinoid production (for LTD) or protein kinase C (PKC) activation (for LTP) in striatal MSPNs. We implement a stochastic model of the post-synaptic signaling pathways in a dendrite with one or more diffusionally coupled spines. The model is validated by comparison to experiments measuring endocannabinoid-dependent depolarization induced suppression of inhibition. Using the validated model, simulations demonstrate that theta burst stimulation, which produces LTP, increases the activation of PKC as compared to 20 Hz stimulation, which produces LTD. The model prediction that PKC activation is required for theta burst LTP is confirmed experimentally. Using the ratio of PKC to endocannabinoid production as an index of plasticity direction, model simulations demonstrate that LTP exhibits spine level spatial specificity, whereas LTD is more …",
Dissecting Inhibitory Control of Striatal Projection Neurons,"D Sriraman, K Blackwell",2011,Journal Front. Neuroinform. Conference Abstract: 4th INCF Congress of Neuroinformatics. doi: 10.3389/conf. fninf,"The striatum is the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia and is involved in processing inputs from the cortex and thalamus. This processing is carried out by GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons (MSPN) that comprise 90-95% of the neuronal population in the rodent striatum (Bolam and Bennett, 1993). These neurons project to the basal ganglia output structures, the globus pallidus and substantia nigra; therefore understanding striatal processing will help elucidate further the factors affecting basal ganglia function. GABAergic inhibition plays a very important role in the modulation of the MSPN network (Tepper et al., 2008). Among the different GABAergic interneurons in the striatum, the fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) provide strong feedforward inhibition of the MSPNs (Koos & Tepper, 1999; Tepper et al., 2008), whereas MSPNs provide widespsread but weak feedback inhibition of each other.

Signaling pathways underlying striatal synaptic plasticity and reward learning,Kim T Blackwell,2008/7,Journal BMC Neuroscience,"Operant conditioning is a form of associative learning in which rewarding an animal's response increases the likelihood of eliciting the response. The ability to use appropriately timed rewards to shape complex behaviour inspires scientists in psychology, neurophysiology, and modeling. Temporal difference models and experimental results agree that reward elicits dopamine release in the striatum and that striatal spiny projection neurons learn the association between the motor response and reward. Nonetheless, critical aspects of operant conditioning behavior have not been replicated. In particular, if synaptic plasticity underlies learning, then the temporal interval between dopamine and cortical inputs should be critical in producing plasticity of cortico-striatal synapses. To investigate the mechanisms whereby glutamate and dopamine interact to produce plasticity, we develop a computer model of the signaling pathways activated by dopamine and glutamate in the spiny projection neuron of the striatum. In the model, dopamine activates adenylyl cyclase, which produces the diffusible molecule, cAMP, which binds to PKA. Glutamate produces an elevation in intracellular calcium, which binds to calmodulin and activates CaMKII. These pathways interact through DARPP32. Model simulations show that simultaneous dopamine and glutamate produce a synergistic increase in PKA activation and DARPP32 phosphorylation consistent with the requirement for both dopamine and glutamate for learning behavior. We are presently developing a multicompartment model in which the reactions and diffusion implicit in these signaling pathways are …",

To explore this issue, we built a network model of FSNs. Each FSN connects to 30–40% of its neighbours, as found experimentally, and each FSN in the network is activated by simulated up-state synaptic inputs. Simulation experiments show that the proportion of synchronous spikes in coupled FSNs increases with gap junction conductance. Proximal gap junctions increase the synchronization more than distal gap junctions.

Striatal spiny projection (SP) neurons control movement initiation by integrating cortical inputs and inhibiting basal ganglia outputs. Central to this control lies a “microcircuit” that consists of a feedback pathway formed by axon collaterals between GABAergic SP neurons and a feedforward pathway from fast spiking (FS) GABAergic interneurons to SP neurons. Here, somatically evoked postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) and currents (PSCs) were compared for both pathways with dual whole cell patch recording in voltage-and current-clamp mode using cortex-striatum-substantia nigra organotypic cultures. On average, feedforward inputs were 1 ms earlier, more reliable, and about twice as large in amplitude compared with most feedback inputs. On the other hand, both pathways exhibited widely varying, partially overlapping amplitude distributions. This variability was already established for single FS neurons targeting many SP neurons. In response to precisely timed action potential bursts, feedforward and feedback inputs consistently showed short-term depression 50–70% in voltage-clamp, although feedback inputs also displayed strong augmentation in current-clamp in line with previous reports. The augmentation of feedback inputs was absent in gramicidin D perforated-patch recording, which also showed the …",

Propagation of calcium waves in the Hermissenda type B photoreceptor,Kim T Blackwell,2001/6/1,Journal Neurocomputing,Hermissenda crassicornis is a seaslug that can be classically conditioned to associate light (the conditioned stimulus) with turbulence (the unconditioned stimulus). Of particular importance is discovering what aspect of the light and turbulence interaction within the type B photoreceptor mediates memory storage. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that calcium released by phototransduction combines non-linearly with calcium resulting from GABA stimulation by evaluating whether GABA can produce a calcium wave that reaches the soma.

Voltage clamp data suggests that two currents generate the light response: a transient sodium current, previously modeled as an IP3-gated sodium current, and a smaller, prolonged current that is sensitive to calcium. A model of the calcium-sensitive light-induced current is developed and included in a model with previously characterized light-induced and voltage-dependent currents.

CHANNEL MODEL OF SECOND MESSENGER MEDIATED TRANSFORMATION OF GABA INDUCED CURRENTS,"KT Blackwell, TP Vogl, DL Alkon","Hermissenda crassicornis exhibits Pavlovian conditioning in response to repeated presentations of paired light and turbulence stimuli. The behavioral changes are correlated with a change in electrical properties of the B photoreceptor cell. In response to turbulence, the hair cell releases GABA onto the terminal branches of the B cell. After repeated stimulation of the B cell using a light flash paired with GABA, the net GABA induced currents change from inhibitory to excitatory. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the change in GABA induced currents from net inhibitory to net excitatory, channel models of the GABA induced currents are developed. The similarity of measured and modeled currents supports the hypothesis that the transformation of GABA currents depends on second messenger mediated events such as phosphorylation.","Scholar articles CHANNEL MODEL OF SECOND MESSENGER MEDIATED TRANSFORMATION OF GABA INDUCED CURRENTSKT Blackwell, TP Vogl, DL AlkonRelated articles All 2 versions ","Hermissenda crassicornis exhibits Pavlovian conditioning in response to repeated presentations of paired light and turbulence stimuli.
