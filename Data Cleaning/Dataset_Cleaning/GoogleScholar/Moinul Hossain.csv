Off-sensing and route manipulation attack: A cross-layer attack in cognitive radio based wireless mesh networks,"Moinul Hossain, Jiang Xie",2018/4/16,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2018-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,"Cognitive Radio (CR) has garnered much attention in the last decade, while the security issues are not fully studied yet. Existing research on attacks and defenses in CR - based networks focuses mostly on individual network layers, whereas cross-layer attacks remain fortified against single-layer defenses. In this paper, we shed light on a new vulnerability in cross-layer routing protocols and demonstrate how a perpetrator can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate traffic flow around it. We propose this cross-layer attack in CR-based wireless mesh networks (CR-WMNs), which we call off-sensing and route manipulation (OS-RM) attack. In this cross-layer assault, off-sensing attack is launched at the lower layers as the point of attack but the final intention is to manipulate traffic flow around the perpetrator. We also introduce a learning strategy for a perpetrator, so that it can gather information from the collaboration with …",15
Third eye: Context-aware detection for hidden terminal emulation attacks in cognitive radio-enabled IoT networks,"Moinul Hossain, Jiang Xie",2020/1/21,Journal IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,"Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been drawing increasing attention because it has a great potential to positively impact human life in a broad range of applications. Nonetheless, the dense deployment of multiple co-located IoT networks that may follow different wireless protocols will essentially bring new network vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack scenario in co-located cognitive radio (CR) enabled IoT networks, where a reactive attacker can emulate the radiation pattern of a hidden terminal (the attacker is from a different network) and can interfere with the transmissions from its hidden counterparts, namely the hidden terminal emulation (HTE) attack. As the dense deployment of IoT nodes-from different networks and technologies-will naturally create such hidden terminal scenarios among IoT devices of different networks, it provides the HTE attacker plausible deniability to …",14
Impact of off-sensing attacks in cognitive radio networks,"Moinul Hossain, Jiang Xie",2017/12/4,Conference GLOBECOM 2017-2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference,"Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising solution to solve the spectrum scarcity problem. It enables opportunistic access to the available licensed spectrum for secondary users (SUs). However, CR networks (CRNs) possess security vulnerabilities and are susceptible to attacks. One of the most common attacks in CRNs, under which perpetrators exploit channel availability, is Primary User Emulation (PUE) attack. Here, a perpetrator mimics the signal characteristics of a benign primary user (PU) and transmits the signal to prevent SUs to access the spectrum. Researchers have proposed many solutions based on periodic sensing of the spectrum. However, all of the existed solutions have a strong assumption that the perpetrator's transmission coincides with the sensing intervals of SUs. In this paper, we introduce a new room of vulnerability in the conventional sensing approaches, where a perpetrator attacks only when …",10
Covert spectrum handoff: An attack in spectrum handoff processes in cognitive radio networks,"Moinul Hossain, Jiang Xie",2018/12/9,Conference 2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),"Spectrum handoff is an integral part of a cognitive radio-based network (CRN). It ensures the operational integrity of opportunistic spectrum access, the avoidance of harmful interference with licensed or primary users (PUs), and the delay requirement during a handoff. However, due to the random nature of PU activity, interference between primary and secondary users (SUs) are difficult to prevent. Proactive spectrum handoff aims to control this harmful interference between PUs and SUs by predicting the future activity of PUs and initiating spectrum handoff before a PU reappears. Though a few security aspects of CRNs attracted attention of researchers, vulnerabilities in the distributed proactive spectrum handoff process remain unstudied. In this paper, we introduce a vulnerability in the proactive spectrum handoff process and demonstrate how a selfish attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve personal gain …",9
Performance analysis of RLS and VSS-LMS channel estimation techniques for 4G MIMO OFDM systems,"Moinul Hossain, SM Farhad, Md Tauseef Riasat",2012/12/22,Conference 2012 15th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT),"In this paper recursive least (RLS) square and variable step size least mean (VSS-LMS) square adaptive channel estimator are described for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Both the techniques uses adaptive estimator which are capable of updating the parameters of estimator continuously and therefore knowledge of channel and noise statistics are not necessary, only knowledge of receive signal is required. From the simulation result it is observed that RLS CE method works better in terms of quick convergence rate than VSS-LMS CE for MIMO OFDM system. In addition, the utilization of more multiple antennas at the transmitter and/or receiver provides a much higher performance compared with fewer antennas.",9
Detection of hidden terminal emulation attacks in cognitive radio-enabled IoT networks,"Moinul Hossain, Jiang Xie",2019/5/20,Conference ICC 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),"Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been drawing increasing attention in that it has a great potential to positively impact human life in a broad range of applications.

Hide and seek: A defense against off-sensing attack in cognitive radio networks,"Moinul Hossain, Jiang Xie",2019/4/29,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2019-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,"In a cognitive radio-based network (CRN), secondary users opportunistically access underutilized spectrum resources and stop utilizing these resources when licensed or primary users reappear. Recently, a new attack, off-sensing (OS), has shed light on a vulnerability in the FCC policy of CRN. OS-attack utilizes the off-sensing interval of a victim to perpetrate the attack and to manipulate the victim's spectrum availability. However, prior work on OS-attack considers a deterministic approach that is unrealistic and is futile to fortify against conventional defense techniques. In this paper, we propose a new random approach, the random-OS attack, which adapts to realistic scenarios and is difficult to detect using conventional techniques. Then, we propose a novel safeguard approach based on the Markov decision process to defend the proposed attack, namely hide and seek. We also introduce an OS-attack detection …",8

A wireless video streaming system based on OFDMA with multi-layer H. 264 coding and adaptive radio resource allocation,"Sheikh Md Rabiul Islam, Moinul Hossain",2011/11/3,Conference 2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing,"With the advancement of video-compression technology and the wide deployment of wireless networks, there is an increasing demand for wireless video communication services, and many design challenges remain to be overcome. In this work, an adaptive framework is proposed and simulated for multi-user video transmission over OFDMA-based communication system for the efficient streaming of multi-layered H.264 video over wireless channels. The aim of the proposed method is to combine adaptive sub-carrier allocation and bit loading with the transmission of the H.264 SVC(Scalable Video Coding ) encoded video sequences in order to increase the number of supported users in the system and provide the best quality of service(QoS) to the sub-carriers.

Hidden terminal emulation: An attack in dense IoT networks in the shared spectrum operation,"Moinul Hossain, Jiang Xie",2019/12/9,Conference 2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),"The Internet of Things (IoT) has been rapidly taking steps towards commercialization. However, the dense deployment of IoT nodes - that may follow different wireless technologies - in the shared spectrum creates a new challenge to solve: secure coordination among co-located IoT nodes from different IoT networks. In this paper, we shed light on this unique challenge, and we illustrate how this challenge has the potential to create a novel vulnerability where an attacker can pose as a hidden terminal (by manipulating its radiation patterns) and interfere with transmissions from its hidden counterparts, namely hidden terminal emulation (HTE) attack. As the dense deployment of IoT nodes will aggravate such hidden terminal interference, it facilitates the HTE attacker plausible deniability to interfere with its hidden counterparts.

Jump and Wobble: A Defense Against Hidden Terminal Emulation Attack in Dense IoT Networks,"Moinul Hossain, Jiang Xie",2021,Conference IEEE International Conference on Communications,"The unprecedented growth in Internet of Things (IoT) deployment is making it difficult to safeguard IoT infrastructures against novel security threats. Recently, a new attack, hidden terminal emulation (HTE), has shed light on a vulnerability in the co-located and dense IoT networks, where the attacker emulates a hidden node from an external co-located network. HTE attack exploits the heterogeneity among different IoT networks, the shared nature of spectrum access, and the proximity to the victim IoT device in a dense IoT scenario to interrupt the victim’s communication. Prior work on HTE attack, however, considers an omniscient attack model, which has strong assumptions. In contrast, we propose a constrained attack model, which considers the sensing constraints of an attacker. Afterward, we propose a novel safeguard approach based on the Markov decision process to counteract the proposed attack model …",2
Intent-aware Permission Architecture: A Model for Rethinking Informed Consent for Android Apps,"Md. Rahman, Elizabeth Miller, Moinul Hossain, Aisha Ali-Gombe",2022/2,Conference International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy - ICISSP,"As data privacy continues to be a crucial human-right concern as recognized by the UN, regulatory agencies have demanded developers obtain user permission before accessing user-sensitive data. Mainly through the use of privacy policies statements, developers fulfill their legal requirements to keep users abreast of the requests for their data.

Nonetheless, recent research has shown that service providers hardly make full disclosure when requesting data in these statements. Neither is the current permission model designed to provide adequate informed consent. Often users have no clear understanding of the reason and scope of usage of the data request.

PACMAN Attack: A Mobility-Powered Attack in Private 5G-Enabled Industrial Automation System,"Md. Rahman, Moinul Hossain, Jiang Xie",2023,Conference IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),"3GPP has introduced Private 5G to support the next-generation industrial automation system (IAS) due to the versatility and flexibility of 5G architecture. Besides the 3.5GHz CBRS band, unlicensed spectrum bands, like 5GHz, are considered as an additional medium because of their free and abundant nature. However, while utilizing the unlicensed band, industrial equipment must coexist with incumbents, e.g., Wi-Fi, which could introduce new security threats and resuscitate old ones. In this paper, we propose a novel attack strategy conducted by a mobility-enabled malicious Wi-Fi access point (mmAP), namely \textit{PACMAN} attack, to exploit vulnerabilities introduced by heterogeneous coexistence. A mmAP is capable of moving around the physical surface to identify mission-critical devices, hopping through the frequency domain to detect the victim's operating channel, and launching traditional MAC layer-based attacks. The multi-dimensional mobility of the attacker makes it impervious to state-of-the-art detection techniques that assume static adversaries. In addition, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) based framework to intelligently design an attacker's multi-dimensional mobility in space and frequency. Mathematical analysis and extensive simulation results exhibit the adverse effect of the proposed mobility-powered attack.",

Security Assessment of Dynamic Spectrum Access in Emerging Wireless Networks,Moinul Hossain,2020,Institution The University of North Carolina at Charlotte,"The proliferation of wireless technologies in a licensed manner has resulted in the scarcity of the radio spectrum. Therefore, spectrum availability has become a challenge for new and existing wireless technologies. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed a new spectrum sharing strategy, ie, dynamic spectrum access (DSA), to opportunistically access the underutilized spectrum resources of licensed users and to fairly share the unlicensed spectrum with others. Cognitive Radio (CR) works as a promising technology to enable this opportunistic or dynamic spectrum access. Moreover, DSA and CR also work as fundamental building blocks of future spectrum coexistence, which aims to improve spectrum equity. This dissertation serves as a means to achieve secure and fair coexistence of different wireless technologies in the same spectrum—whether licensed or unlicensed.",
