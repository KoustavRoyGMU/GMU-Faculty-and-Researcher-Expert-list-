Feasibility of wearable sensing for in-home finger rehabilitation early after stroke,"Quentin Sanders, Vicky Chan, Renee Augsburger, Steven C Cramer, David J Reinkensmeyer, An H Do",2020/4/15,Journal IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,"Wearable grip sensing shows potential for hand rehabilitation, but few studies have studied feasibility early after stroke. Here, we studied a wearable grip sensor integrated with a musical computer game (MusicGlove). Among the stroke patients admitted to a hospital without limiting complications, 13% had adequate hand function for system use. Eleven subjects used MusicGlove at home over three weeks with a goal of nine hours of use. On average they achieved 4.1 ± 3.2 (SD) hours of use and completed 8627 ± 7500 grips, an amount comparable to users in the chronic phase of stroke measured in a previous study. The rank-order usage data were well fit by distributions that arise in machine failure theory. Users operated the game at high success levels, achieving note-hitting success >75% for 84% of the 1061 songs played. They changed game parameters infrequently (31% of songs), but in a way that logically …",14
Design and control of a novel grip amplifier to support pinch grip with a minimal soft hand exoskeleton,"Quentin Sanders, Shusuke Okita, Joan Lobo-Prat, Diogo Schwerz De Lucena, Brendan W Smith, David J Reinkensmeyer",2018/8/26,Conference 2018 7th IEEE International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (Biorob),"Hand exoskeletons could potentially improve hand use after stroke but are typically obtrusive and non-intuitive. Here, we provide a rationale for a control strategy suitable for a minimalistic hand exoskeleton. We also report on pilot testing of the strategy, and on a soft actuator design for implementing the strategy. The strategy is based on four experimental observations from studies conducted in our laboratory with unimpaired individuals and stroke survivors. First, using only a pinch grip, unimpaired people can achieve a substantial level of hand function when measured with clinical assessments. Second, the level of achieved function corresponds well with what is necessary to drive daily hand use, as measured by a novel wearable sensor with stroke survivors. Third, even people with severe hand impairment after stroke have a well-preserved ability to control isometric finger flexion force, even though they cannot …",3
Design of a wearable robot to enable bimanual manipulation after stroke,"Sumner Norman, Wesley Tang, Quentin Sanders, Yasemin Sarigul-Klijn",2016,"Journal Southern California Robotics Symposium (La Jolla, CA)","Individuals often suffer from hemiparesis after stroke, and often cannot use their hands together to achieve bimanual functions. Many lack the ability to extend the fingers in one hand. Wearable robots could potentially enable finger extension, but many devices are limited due to their size, and focus on multiple finger assistance. We developed a wearable Robotic Hand Extension Device (RHED) that utilizes the user’s residual capacity for finger flexion while providing robotassisted extension for the thumb and index finger. Use of a Bowden cable allows the majority of mass to be placed on the user’s forearm, while also preventing cable slack during wrist manipulation. A magnetic ring on the unimpaired hand and a threeaxis magnetometer on the impaired arm facilitate intuitive, touch-free gesture commands. The user can choose different postures of the impaired hand, including the four permutations of the open and closed thumb and index finger. By selecting an appropriate hand posture via gesture command, the user can incorporate the impaired arm into a supporting role, facilitating bimanual activities such as jar opening and toothpaste uncapping. Finally we attempt to validate force production of the exoskeleton by simulating the index finger using the Hill model of muscle.",2

Force acquisition frequency is less impaired compared to grip strength or hand dexterity in individuals with chronic stroke,"Quentin Sanders, Vicky Chan, Oliver Stoller, David Reinkensmeyer",2022/8/19,Journal Experimental Brain Research,"Despite numerous studies that show force regulation is impaired after stroke, two recent studies suggest that the ability to regulate submaximal, isometric grip forces may remain substantially intact. Here we asked how this aspect of hand motor control, measured for both a power grip and pinch grip, compares to two other key aspects of hand function–grip strength and dexterity. For 20 individuals with a range of hand impairment levels in the chronic phase of stroke (Age: 62 ± 16.0 years, Time post stroke: 958.3 ± 966.5 days, Sex: 19 M 1F) we quantified the average rate of target acquisition for force targets in the range of 3 to 30% maximum voluntary contraction as participants used the two different grips to squeeze a force sensor to control a cursor on a screen. The same force sensor was used to assess subject grip strength for the two grips, while dexterity was assessed using the Box and Blocks Test (BBT), and …",
Hand Rehabilitation After Stroke: Understanding and Optimizing the Usage of Wearable Robotic Technologies,Quentin Sanders,2020,"Institution University of California, Irvine","The hand is a highly complex machine as evidenced by its mechanical structure and the large amount of cortical resources it requires for both sensation and motor control. Stroke is a pervasive, global problem that causes disability by damaging hand neural control systems. Movement practice can help drive the changes in neural connectivity needed to restore these systems, however, stroke patients typically undertake limited amounts of movement practice. The premise of this dissertation is that mechanical engineering techniques, and, specifically, the appropriate design of robotic therapy technologies based on an engineering-informed understanding of human hand mechanics and function, can improve the biomedical situation for individuals after a stroke.",
Grip Amplifier: A Residual Force Control Strategy to Support Pinch Grip with a Minimalistic Hand Exoskeleton,Quentin Sanders,2018,"Institution University of California, Irvine","Hand exoskeletons could potentially improve hand use after stroke, but are typically obtrusive, and lack intuitive control. Here we propose a grip force strategy suitable for a minimalistic hand exoskeleton based on three key concepts. First, people achieve substantial hand functionality when using only pinch grip. Second, people who have a stroke retain isometric force control ability. Third, force generation is highly correlated between fingers after a stroke. From these observations we developed a control strategy based on measuring the isometric flexion force produced by digits 3-5 against the palm to control the force of an exoskeleton assisting in pinch grip. We implemented this “residual force control” strategy (RFCS) using the FINGER exoskeleton with ten unimpaired participants. Participants performed five sets of five lifts with no exoskeleton, with the exoskeleton donned on but powered off, and with the RFCS …",

Participants performed five sets of five lifts with no exoskeleton, with the exoskeleton donned on but powered off, and with the RFCS using two amplification gains. When using the RFCS participants were asked to maximize the contribution of the robot to object force, and we displayed the percent robot contribution using a computer monitor after each set. Participants were able to use the RFCS to lift the object, significantly increasing the contribution of force by the robot as the sets progressed. However, the grip force became larger and less dynamic compared to when participants were not wearing the exoskeleton. This suggests that unimpaired subjects could intuitively use this strategy to pick up an object and learn to amplify their grip force with practice. However, the strategy alters the normal grip force control strategy.",
