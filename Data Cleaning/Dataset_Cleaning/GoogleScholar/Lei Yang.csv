Accuracy vs. efficiency: Achieving both through fpga-implementation aware neural architecture search,"Weiwen Jiang, Xinyi Zhang, Edwin H-M Sha, Lei Yang, Qingfeng Zhuge, Yiyu Shi, Jingtong Hu",2019/6/2,Book Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019,"A fundamental question lies in almost every application of deep neural networks: what is the optimal neural architecture given a specific data set? Recently, several Neural Architecture Search (NAS) frameworks have been developed that use reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithm to search for the solution. However, most of them take a long time to find the optimal architecture due to the huge search space and the lengthy training process needed to evaluate each candidate. In addition, most of them aim at accuracy only and do not take into consideration the hardware that will be used to implement the architecture. This will potentially lead to excessive latencies beyond specifications, rendering the resulting architectures useless. To address both issues, in this paper we use Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) as a vehicle to present a novel hardware-aware NAS framework, namely FNAS, which …",130
Hardware/software co-exploration of neural architectures,"Weiwen Jiang, Lei Yang, Edwin Hsing-Mean Sha, Qingfeng Zhuge, Shouzhen Gu, Sakyasingha Dasgupta, Yiyu Shi, Jingtong Hu",2020/4/8,Journal IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,"We propose a novel hardware and software co-exploration framework for efficient neural architecture search (NAS). Different from existing hardware-aware NAS which assumes a fixed hardware design and explores the NAS space only, our framework simultaneously explores both the architecture search space and the hardware design space to identify the best neural architecture and hardware pairs that maximize both test accuracy and hardware efficiency. Such a practice greatly opens up the design freedom and pushes forward the Pareto frontier between hardware efficiency and test accuracy for better design tradeoffs. The framework iteratively performs a two-level (fast and slow) exploration. Without lengthy training, the fast exploration can effectively fine-tune hyperparameters and prune inferior architectures in terms of hardware specifications, which significantly accelerates the NAS process. Then, the slow …",114

However, it remains an open problem how to integrate NAS with Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), despite them being the most powerful AI accelerating platforms. The major bottleneck comes from the large design freedom associated with ASIC designs. Moreover, with the consideration that multiple DNNs will run in parallel for different workloads with diverse layer operations and sizes, integrating heterogeneous ASIC sub-accelerators for distinct DNNs in one design can significantly boost performance, and at the same time further complicate the design space.

Standing on the shoulders of giants: Hardware and neural architecture co-search with hot start,"Weiwen Jiang, Lei Yang, Sakyasingha Dasgupta, Jingtong Hu, Yiyu Shi",2020/10/2,Journal IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,"Hardware and neural architecture co-search that automatically generates artificial intelligence (AI) solutions from a given dataset are promising to promote AI democratization; however, the amount of time that is required by current co-search frameworks is in the order of hundreds of GPU hours for one target hardware. This inhibits the use of such frameworks on commodity hardware. The root cause of the low efficiency in existing co-search frameworks is the fact that they start from a “cold” state (i.e., search from scratch). In this article, we propose a novel framework, namely, HotNAS, that starts from a “hot” state based on a set of existing pretrained models (also known as model zoo) to avoid lengthy training time. As such, the search time can be reduced from 200 GPU hours to less than 3 GPU hours. In HotNAS, in addition to hardware design space and neural architecture search space, we further integrate a …",54

We 1) give an intuitive gender bias judgement method by comparing the different relation degree between the genders and the occupation according to the attention scores, 2) design a gender bias detector by modifying the attention module, 3) insert the gender bias detector into different positions of the model to present the internal gender bias flow, and 4) draw the consistent gender bias conclusion by scanning the entire Wikipedia, a BERT pretraining dataset. We observe that 1) the attention matrices, Wq and Wk introduce much more gender bias than other modules (including the embedding layer) and 2) the bias degree changes periodically inside of the model (attention matrix Q, K, V, and the remaining part of the attention layer (including the fully-connected layer, the residual connection, and the layer normalization module) enhance the gender bias while the averaged attentions reduces the bias).",5
Co-exploration of graph neural network and network-on-chip design using automl,"Daniel Manu, Shaoyi Huang, Caiwen Ding, Lei Yang",2021/6/22,Book Proceedings of the 2021 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI,"Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have exhibited high efficiency in several graph-based machine learning tasks. Compared with the neural networks for computer vision or speech tasks (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks), GNNs have much higher requirements on communication due to the complicated graph structures; however, when applying GNNs for real-world applications, say in recommender systems (e.g. Uber Eats), it commonly has the real-time requirements. To deal with the tradeoff between the complicated architecture and the high-demand timing performance, both GNN architecture and hardware accelerator need to be optimized. Network-on-Chip (NoC), derived for efficiently managing the high-volume of communications, naturally becomes one of the top candidates to accelerate GNNs.

Contention minimized bypassing in SMART NoC,"Peng Chen, Weichen Liu, Mengquan Li, Lei Yang, Nan Guan",2020/1/13,Conference 2020 25th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC),"SMART, a recently proposed dynamically reconfigurable NoC, enables single-cycle long-distance communication by building single-bypass paths. However, such a single-cycle single-bypass path will be broken when contention occurs. Thus, lower-priority packets will be buffered at intermediate routers with blocking latency from higher-priority packets, and extra router-stage latency to rebuild remaining path, reducing the bypassing benefits that SMART offers. In this paper, we for the first time propose an effective routing strategy to achieve nearly contention-free bypassing in SMART NoC. Specifically, we identify two different routes for communication pairs: direct route, with which data can reach the destination in a single bypass; and indirect route, with which data can reach the destination in two bypasses via an intermediate router.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, contrastive learning (CL) and masked autoencoders (MAE), can leverage the unlabeled data to pre-train models, followed by fine-tuning with limited labels. However, combining SSL and FL has unique challenges. For example, CL requires diverse data but each device only has limited data.

Isolation of Physical and Logical Views of Dark-Silicon Many-Core Systems for Reliability and Performance Co-Optimization,"Lei Yang, Weichen Liu, Weiwen Jiang, Mengquan Li, Jie Wang",2015,"Conference Embedded System Technology: 13th National Conference, ESTC 2015, Beijing, China, October 10–11, 2015, Revised Selected Papers 13","A fraction of a many-core chip has to become powered off in order to maintain allowable power budget and safe temperature in the dark silicon era. Techniques have been developed to selectively activate cores in distributed physical locations to avoid temperature hotspot. It results in the unexpected increase of communication overhead due to longer average distance between active cores on Network-on-Chip (NoC). We propose a physical and logical isolated framework based on Folded Torus-like NoC for heterogeneous many-core systems to achieve the guaranteed temperature reliability and satisfied application performance requirement. Physically distributed cores are interconnected through folded torus-like NoC and organized in clusters to enable logically condensed intercommunications within it. Compared to traditional mesh-like systems, the proposed folded torus-like organization can achieve on …",
