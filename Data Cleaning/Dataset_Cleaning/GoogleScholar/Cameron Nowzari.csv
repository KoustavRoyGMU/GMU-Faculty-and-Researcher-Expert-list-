Analysis and control of epidemics: A survey of spreading processes on complex networks,"Cameron Nowzari, Victor M Preciado, George J Pappas",2016/1/27,Source IEEE Control Systems Magazine,"This article reviews and presents various solved and open problems in the development, analysis, and control of epidemic models. The proper modeling and analysis of spreading processes has been a long-standing area of research among many different fields, including mathematical biology, physics, computer science, engineering, economics, and the social sciences. One of the earliest epidemic models conceived was by Daniel Bernoulli in 1760, which was motivated by studying the spread of smallpox [1]. In addition to Bernoulli, there were many different researchers also working on mathematical epidemic models around this time [2]. These initial models were quite simplistic, and the further development and study of such models dates back to the 1900s [3]-[6], where still-simple models were studied to provide insight into how various diseases can spread through a population. In recent years, there has been …",618
Event-triggered communication and control of networked systems for multi-agent consensus,"Cameron Nowzari, Eloy Garcia, Jorge Cortés",2019/7/1,Journal Automatica,"This article provides an introduction to event-triggered coordination for multi-agent average consensus. We provide a comprehensive account of the motivations behind the use of event-triggered strategies for consensus, the methods for algorithm synthesis, the technical challenges involved in establishing desirable properties of the resulting implementations, and their applications in distributed control. We pay special attention to the assumptions on the capabilities of the network agents and the resulting features of the algorithm execution, including the interconnection topology, the evaluation of triggers, and the role of imperfect information. The issues raised in our discussion transcend the specific consensus problem and are indeed characteristic of cooperative algorithms for networked systems that solve other coordination tasks. As our discussion progresses, we make these connections clear, highlighting general …",353
Distributed event-triggered coordination for average consensus on weight-balanced digraphs,"Cameron Nowzari, Jorge Cortés",2016/6/1,Journal Automatica,"This paper proposes a novel distributed event-triggered algorithmic solution to the multi-agent average consensus problem for networks whose communication topology is described by weight-balanced, strongly connected digraphs. The proposed event-triggered communication and control strategy does not rely on individual agents having continuous or periodic access to information about the state of their neighbors. In addition, it does not require the agents to have a priori knowledge of any global parameter to execute the algorithm. We show that, under the proposed law, events cannot be triggered an infinite number of times in any finite period (i.e., no Zeno behavior), and that the resulting network executions provably converge to the average of the initial agents’ states exponentially fast. We also provide weaker conditions on connectivity under which convergence is guaranteed when the communication …",241
Self-triggered coordination of robotic networks for optimal deployment,"Cameron Nowzari, Jorge Cortés",2012/6/1,Journal Automatica,"This paper studies a deployment problem for a group of robots where individual agents operate with outdated information about each other’s locations. Our objective is to understand to what extent outdated information is still useful and at which point it becomes essential to obtain new, up-to-date information. We propose a self-triggered coordination algorithm based on spatial partitioning techniques with uncertain information. We analyze its correctness in synchronous and asynchronous scenarios, and establish the same convergence guarantees that a synchronous algorithm with perfect information at all times would achieve. The technical approach combines computational geometry, set-valued stability analysis, and event-based systems.",170
Optimal resource allocation for control of networked epidemic models,"Cameron Nowzari, Victor M Preciado, George J Pappas",2015/9/25,Journal IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems,"This paper proposes and analyzes a generalized epidemic model over arbitrary directed graphs with heterogeneous nodes. The proposed model, called the generalized-susceptible exposed infected vigilant, subsumes a large number of popular epidemic models considered in the literature as special cases. Using a mean-field approximation, we derive a set of ODEs describing the spreading dynamics, provide a careful analysis of the disease-free equilibrium, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for global exponential stability. Building on this analysis, we consider the problem of containing an initial epidemic outbreak under budget constraints. More specifically, we consider a collection of control actions (e.g., administering vaccines/antidotes, limiting the traffic between cities, or running awareness campaigns), for which we are given suitable cost functions. In this context, we develop an optimization …",129
"Zeno-free, distributed event-triggered communication and control for multi-agent average consensus","Cameron Nowzari, Jorge Cortés",2014/6/4,Conference 2014 American Control Conference,"This paper studies a distributed event-triggered communication and control strategy that solves the multi-agent average consensus problem. The proposed strategy does not rely on the continuous or periodic availability of information to an agent about the state of its neighbors, but instead prescribes isolated event times where both communication and controller updates occur. In addition, all parameters required for its implementation can be locally determined by the agents. We show that the resulting network executions are guaranteed to converge to the average of the initial agents' states, establish that events cannot be triggered an infinite number of times in any finite time period (i.e., no Zeno behavior), and characterize the exponential rate of convergence. We also provide sufficient conditions for convergence in scenarios with time-varying communication topologies. Simulations illustrate our results.",90
Optimal resource allocation for competitive spreading processes on bilayer networks,"Nicholas J Watkins, Cameron Nowzari, Victor M Preciado, George J Pappas",2016/9/9,Journal IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems,"We consider a competitive epidemic process in a bilayer network, and develop a framework to find an optimal allocation of control resources to eliminate one of the epidemics. We consider the SI 1  SI 2  S model, a recent generalization of the popular SIS model to the case of two competitive epidemics. We start our analysis by extending the standard SI 1  SI 2  S formulation with homogeneous parameters to a heterogeneous setting with edge-dependent infection rates, and node-dependent recovery rates. We then find necessary and sufficient conditions under which the mean-field approximation of a chosen epidemic process stabilizes to extinction exponentially quickly. Leveraging this result, we develop a framework for the solution of two optimization problems. In the first, we find an optimal allocation of control resources in order to eradicate the chosen epidemic at a minimum cost. In the second, we are given a …",61
Team-triggered coordination for real-time control of networked cyber-physical systems,"Cameron Nowzari, Jorge Cortés",2015/4/13,Journal IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"This paper studies the real-time implementation of distributed controllers on networked cyber-physical systems. We build on the strengths of event- and self-triggered control to synthesize a unified approach, termed team-triggered, where agents make promises to one another about their future states and are responsible for warning each other if they later decide to break them. The information provided by these promises allows individual agents to autonomously schedule information requests in the future and sets the basis for maintaining desired levels of performance at lower implementation cost. We establish provably correct guarantees for the distributed strategies that result from the proposed approach and examine their robustness against delays, packet drops, and communication noise. The results are illustrated in simulations of a multi-agent formation control problem.",56
Lightweight node-level malware detection and network-level malware confinement in iot networks,"Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao, Hossein Sayadi, Hosein Mohammadi Makrani, Cameron Nowzari, Setareh Rafatirad, Houman Homayoun",2019/3/25,"Conference 2019 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)","The sheer size of IoT networks being deployed today presents an ""attack surface"" and poses significant security risks at a scale never before encountered. In other words, a single device/node in a network that becomes infected with malware has the potential to spread malware across the network, eventually ceasing the network functionality. Simply detecting and quarantining the malware in IoT networks does not guarantee to prevent malware propagation. On the other hand, use of traditional control theory for malware confinement is not effective, as most of the existing works do not consider real-time malware control strategies that can be implemented using uncertain infection information of the nodes in the network or have the containment problem decoupled from network performance. In this work, we propose a two-pronged approach, where a runtime malware detector (HaRM) that employs Hardware …",54
Online planning for energy-efficient and disturbance-aware uav operations,"Nicola Bezzo, Kartik Mohta, Cameron Nowzari, Insup Lee, Vijay Kumar, George Pappas",2016/10/9,Conference 2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),"In this paper we consider an online planning problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations. Specifically, a UAV has the task of reaching a goal from a set of possible goals while minimizing the amount of energy required. Due to unforeseen disturbances, it is possible that initially attractive goals might end up being very expensive during the execution. Thus, two main problems are investigated here: i) how to predict and plan the motion of the UAV at run time to minimize its energy consumption and ii) when to schedule next replanning time to avoid unnecessary periodic re-evaluation executions. Our approach considers a nonlinear model of the system for which a model predictive controller is used to determine the desired control inputs for each possible goal. These control inputs are then used to estimate the energy required to reach the different goals. Finally, a self-triggered scheduling policy determines …",52
Robust economic model predictive control of continuous-time epidemic processes,"Nicholas J Watkins, Cameron Nowzari, George J Pappas",2019/5/27,Journal IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"In this paper, we develop a robust economic model predictive controller for the containment of stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-vigilant (SEIV) epidemic processes, which drives the process to extinction quickly, while minimizing the rate at which control resources are used. The study we present here is significant in that it addresses the problem of efficiently controlling general stochastic epidemic systems without relying on mean-field approximation, which is an important issue in the theory of stochastic epidemic processes. This enables us to provide rigorous convergence guarantees on the stochastic epidemic model itself, improving over the mean-field type convergence results of most prior work. There are two primary technical difficulties addressed in treating this problem: 1) constructing a means of tractably approximating the evolution of the process so that the designed approximation is robust to the …",44
Periodic event-triggered average consensus over directed graphs,"Xiangyu Meng, Lihua Xie, Yeng Chai Soh, Cameron Nowzari, George J Pappas",2015/12/15,Conference 2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"This paper considers a multi-agent consensus problem over strongly connected and balanced directed graphs. Unlike many works that consider continuous or periodic communication and control strategies, we are interested in developing an event-triggered algorithm to reduce the overall load of the network in terms of limited communication and control updates. Furthermore, we focus on a sampled-data implementation that allows agents in a communication network to determine whether locally sampled information should be discarded or broadcasted to neighbors. This formulation allows us to automatically rule out Zeno behavior that is often a challenge in distributed event-triggered systems. We show that all agents eventually rendezvous at the centroid of their initial formation given an appropriate selection of the local sampling period and event-triggering parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the …",37
Data-driven network resource allocation for controlling spreading processes,"Shuo Han, Victor M Preciado, Cameron Nowzari, George J Pappas",2015/11/11,Journal IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,"We propose a mathematical framework, based on conic geometric programming, to control a susceptible-infected-susceptible viral spreading process taking place in a directed contact network with unknown contact rates. We assume that we have access to time series data describing the evolution of the spreading process observed by a collection of sensor nodes over a finite time interval. We propose a data-driven robust optimization framework to find the optimal allocation of protection resources (e.g., vaccines and/or antidotes) to eradicate the viral spread at the fastest possible rate. In contrast to current network identification heuristics, in which a single network is identified to explain the observed data, we use available data to define an uncertainty set containing all networks that are coherent with empirical observations. Through Lagrange duality and convexification of the uncertainty set, we are able to relax the …",34
Stability analysis of generalized epidemic models over directed networks,"Cameron Nowzari, Victor M Preciado, George J Pappas",2014/12/15,Conference 53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,"In this paper we propose a generalized version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Vigilant (SEIV) disease spreading model over arbitrary directed graphs. In the standard SEIV model there is only one infectious state. Our model instead allows for the exposed state to also be infectious to healthy individuals. This model captures the fact that infected individuals may act differently when they are aware of their infection. For instance, when the individual is aware of the infection, different actions may be taken, such as staying home from work, causing less chance for spreading the infection. This model generalizes the standard SEIV model which is already known to generalize many other infection spreading models available. We use tools from nonlinear stability analysis to suggest a coordinate transformation that allows us to study the stability of the origin of a relevant linear system. We provide a necessary and …",33
Robust dynamic event-triggered coordination with a designable minimum interevent time,"James Berneburg, Cameron Nowzari",2020/9/1,Journal IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"This article revisits the classical multiagent average consensus problem for which many different event-triggered control strategies have been proposed over the last decade. Many of the earliest versions of these works conclude asymptotic stability without proving that Zeno behavior, or deadlocks, do not occur along the trajectories of the system. More recent works that resolve this issue either: propose the use of a dwell time that forces interevent times to be lower bounded away from zero but sacrifice asymptotic convergence in exchange for practical convergence (or convergence to a neighborhood); guarantee non-Zeno behaviors and asymptotic convergence but do not provide a positive minimum interevent time guarantee; or are not fully distributed. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of these works provide no form of robustness analysis on the event-triggering strategy. More specifically, if arbitrarily small …",28
Self-triggered time-varying convex optimization,"Mahyar Fazlyab, Cameron Nowzari, George J Pappas, Alejandro Ribeiro, Victor M Preciado",2016/12/12,Conference 2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"In this paper, we propose a self-triggered algorithm to solve a class of convex optimization problems with time-varying objective functions. It is known that the trajectory of the optimal solution can be asymptotically tracked by a continuous-time state update law. Unfortunately, implementing this requires continuous evaluation of the gradient and the inverse Hessian of the objective function which is not amenable to digital implementation. Alternatively, we draw inspiration from self-triggered control to propose a strategy that autonomously adapts the times at which it makes computations about the objective function, yielding a piece-wise affine state update law. The algorithm does so by predicting the temporal evolution of the gradient using known upper bounds on higher order derivatives of the objective function. Our proposed method guarantees convergence to arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal trajectory in …",28
Multi-agent coordination with asynchronous cloud access,"Cameron Nowzari, George J Pappas",2016/7/6,Conference 2016 American Control Conference (ACC),"In this work we study a multi-agent coordination problem in which agents are only able to communicate intermittently with the cloud. To minimize the amount of required communication, we are interested in developing a self-triggered algorithm that determines when communication with the cloud is necessary. Unlike the overwhelming majority of similar works that propose distributed event- and/or self-triggered control laws, this work doesn't assume agents can be `listening' continuously. In other words, when an event is triggered by one agent, neighboring agents will not be aware of this until the next time they establish communication with the cloud. Each time an agent communicates with the cloud, it must determine the next time to reestablish communication while guaranteeing the completion of some global task. We show that our self-triggered coordination algorithm guarantees that the system asymptotically …",27
Deep multi-attributed graph translation with node-edge co-evolution,"Xiaojie Guo, Liang Zhao, Cameron Nowzari, Setareh Rafatirad, Houman Homayoun, Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao",2019/11/8,Conference 2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),"Generalized from image and language translation, graph translation aims to generate a graph in the target domain by conditioning an input graph in the source domain. This promising topic has attracted fast-increasing attention recently. Existing works are limited to either merely predicting the node attributes of graphs with fixed topology or predicting only the graph topology without considering node attributes, but cannot simultaneously predict both of them, due to substantial challenges: 1) difficulty in characterizing the interactive, iterative, and asynchronous translation process of both nodes and edges and 2) difficulty in discovering and maintaining the inherent consistency between the node and edge in predicted graphs.

Optimal resource allocation for competing epidemics over arbitrary networks,"Nicholas J Watkins, Cameron Nowzari, Victor M Preciado, George J Pappas",2015/7/1,Conference 2015 American Control Conference (ACC),"This paper studies an SI 1 SI 2 S spreading model of two competing behaviors over a bilayer network. In particular, we address the problem of determining resource allocation strategies that ensure the extinction of one behavior while not necessarily ensuring the extinction of the other, and pose a marketing problem in which such a model can be of use. Our discussion begins by extending the SI 1 SI 2 S model to node-dependent infection and recovery parameters and generalized graph topologies, contrasting prior work. We then find conditions under which a chosen epidemic becomes extinct. We show that a distribution of resources which realizes this goal always exists for some budget under mild assumptions. We address the case in which the available budget is not sufficient for extinction by establishing analytic means for mitigating the spreading rate of the unwanted behavior. We demonstrate a method for …",22

Asynchronous periodic event-triggered coordination of multi-agent systems,"Yaohua Liu, Cameron Nowzari, Zhi Tian, Qing Ling",2017/12/12,Conference 2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"This paper proposes an asynchronous periodic event-triggered communication and control law to solve the multi-agent consensus problem. In contrast with similar works on periodic event-triggered coordination, we do not assume a common sampling period among the agents. Since agents can only take actions (e.g., broadcast a message, update a control signal) at their own sampling times, agents in general do not have the luxury of being able to immediately react to new information received by neighbors as is often assumed in similar works. This type of model is much more pragmatic as it better accounts for different pieces of hardware/software operating at different frequencies. We provide sufficient conditions under which the proposed algorithm guarantees that the agents converge to a consensus state. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",16
A general class of spreading processes with non-Markovian dynamics,"Cameron Nowzari, Masaki Ogura, Victor M Preciado, George J Pappas",2015/12/15,Conference 2015 54th IEEE conference on decision and control (CDC),"In this paper we propose a general class of models for spreading processes we call the SI*V * model.

As a result, this generalizes an extremely large number of models studied in the literature including the MSEIV, MSEIR, MSEIS, SEIV, SEIR, SEIS, SIV, SIRS, SIR, and SIS models. Furthermore, we show how the SI*V * model allows us to model non-Poisson spreading processes letting us capture much more complicated dynamics than existing works such as information spreading through social networks or the delayed incubation period of a disease like Ebola.

Asynchronous distributed event-triggered coordination for multiagent coverage control,"Mohanad Ajina, Daniel Tabatabai, Cameron Nowzari",2020/1/23,Journal IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,"This article revisits a multiagent deployment problem where agents are restricted from requesting information from other agents as well as sending acknowledgments when information is received. These communication constraints relax the assumptions of instantaneous communication and synchronous actions by agents (request and response actions). In this article, we propose a fully asynchronous communication aware solution to the multiagent deployment problem that uses an event-triggered broadcasting strategy. Unlike all existing triggered solutions, our event-triggered broadcasting algorithm relies on agents to decide when to broadcast (push) information to others in the network without the need for a response from other agents. In addition, the proposed strategy determines how best to move when up-to-date information is unavailable and cannot be requested. The algorithm is capable of achieving similar …",14
Self-triggered pursuit of a single evader,"Saad A Aleem, Cameron Nowzari, George J Pappas",2015/12/15,Conference 2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"This paper studies a continuous-time pursuit-evasion problem involving a single pursuer and a single evader on a plane.

To this end, we propose a self-triggered control strategy such that the pursuer can autonomously decide, based on out-dated information, when new samples of the evader's position is required in order to satisfy desired performance metrics. Our proposed algorithm guarantees capture of the evader in finite time with a finite number of sporadic updates without sacrificing any performance in terms of guaranteed time to capture as compared to classic algorithms that assume continuous information is available at all times.

We develop an observation model for the epidemic process, and demonstrate that if the set of observed nodes is sufficiently well structured, then the random variables which denote the process' infections are conditionally independent given the observations. We then leverage the attained conditional independence property to construct tractable mechanisms for the inference and prediction of the process state, avoiding the need to use mean field approximations or combinatorial representations.

In contrast to current network identification heuristics, in which a single network is identified to explain the observed data, we use available data to define an uncertainty set containing all networks that are coherent with empirical observations. Our characterization of this uncertainty set of networks is tractable in the context of conic geometric programming, recently proposed by Chandrasekaran and Shah, which allows us to efficiently find the optimal allocation of resources to control the worst-case spread that can take place in the uncertainty set of networks. We illustrate our approach in a transportation network from which we collect partial data about the dynamics of a hypothetical epidemic outbreak over a finite period of time.",9

Self-triggered optimal servicing in dynamic environments with acyclic structure,"Cameron Nowzari, Jorge Cortés",2012/12/20,Journal IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,This paper considers a class of scenarios where targets emerge from some known location and move towards some unknown destinations in a weighted acyclic digraph. A decision maker with knowledge of the target positions must decide when preparations should be made at any given destination for their arrival. The decision maker faces a timing tradeoff: early decisions mean more time for preparation at the cost of higher uncertainty in the target's true destination while later decisions mean less uncertainty at the cost of having less time to prepare. We show how this problem can be formulated as an optimal stopping problem on a Markov chain. This sets the basis for the introduction of the best investment algorithm which prescribes when investments must be made conditioned on the target's motion along the digraph. We establish the optimality of this prescription and examine its robustness against changes in …,7
Self-triggered and team-triggered control of networked cyber-physical systems,"Cameron Nowzari, Jorge Cortés",2015/2/23,Journal Event-Based Control and Signal Processing,"This chapter presents extensions to event-triggered control called self-triggered and team-triggered control. Unlike event-triggered controllers that prescribe an action when an appropriate ‘event’has occurred, self-triggered controllers prescribe a time in the future at which an action should take place. The benefit of this is that continuous or periodic monitoring of the event is no longer required. This is especially useful in networked scenarios where the events of subsystems may depend on the state of other subsystems in the network because persistent communication is not required. However, self-triggered algorithms can generally yield conservative decisions on when actions should take place to properly guarantee the desired stability results. Consequently, we also introduce the team-triggered control approach that combines ideas from both event-and selftriggered control to help overcome these limitations.",6

On the effects of collision avoidance on emergent swarm behavior,"Chris Taylor, Colin Luzzi, Cameron Nowzari",2020/7/1,Conference 2020 American Control Conference (ACC),"Swarms of autonomous agents, through their decentralized and robust nature, show great promise as a future solution to the myriad missions of business, military, and humanitarian relief. The diverse nature of mission sets creates the need for swarm algorithms to be deployed on a variety of hardware platforms. Certain swarm behaviors have been demonstrated on platforms where collisions between agents are harmless, but on many platforms collisions are prohibited since they would damage the agents involved. The available literature typically assumes that collisions can be avoided by adding a collision avoidance algorithm on top of an existing swarm behavior. Through an illustrative example in our experience replicating a particular behavior, we show that this can be difficult to achieve since the swarm behavior can be disrupted by the collision avoidance.

A robust moment closure for general continuous-time epidemic processes,"Nicholas J Watkins, Cameron Nowzari, George J Pappas",2018/12/17,Conference 2018 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"We develop a robust moment closure for a general class of continuous-time epidemic spreading processes, the elements of which are prevalent in the literature. Our moment closure method takes as input a general stochastic compartmental spreading process defined for n agents and m compartments, and produces a system of 2nm differential equations whose solutions provide nontrivial approximations to the marginal compartmental membership probabilities for each agent.

An event-triggered virtual force algorithm for multi-agent coverage control with obstacles,"Mohanad Ajina, Cameron Nowzari",2018/6/27,Conference 2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC),"In this work, we propose an event-triggered algorithm based on a virtual force deployment approach to address the multi-agent coverage control problem in the presence of obstacles.

In particular, most works that consider this problem assume agents are in constant communication with each other. Instead, the event-triggered algorithm we propose allows agents to decide for themselves when communication is necessary while still achieving the primary goal of covering the environment and ensuring collisions are avoided.

In contrast to prior work, the methods developed describe a dynamics which bound the exact moment dynamics, without explicitly requiring a priori knowledge of non-negative (or non-positive) covariance between pairs of system variables. Moreover, we provide systems which provide both upper- and lower- bounds on the process moments. We then show that when system variables are shown to be non-negatively (or non-positively) correlated for all time in the system's evolution, we may leverage the knowledge to create better approximating systems. We then apply the technique to several previously studied compartmental spreading processes, and compare the bounding systems' performance to the standard approximations studied in prior literature.",4

However, these results only apply to undirected communication networks and are tied to specific Lyapunov functions.

This problem is motivated by the pressing need for algorithms that are able to efficiently and reliably operate on overcrowded wireless networks or otherwise poor-performing RF environments. We develop a self-triggered coordination algorithm that guarantees convergence to the desired set of states with probability 1. The algorithm is developed by using ideas from event/self-triggered coordination and allows agents to autonomously decide for themselves when to broadcast information, at which frequency and power, and how to move based on information received from other agents in the network.

Stochastic vs. deterministic modeling for the spread of covid-19 in small networks,"Mohammad Mubarak, James Berneburg, Cameron Nowzari",2021/5/25,Conference 2021 American Control Conference (ACC),"This paper proposes and analyzes a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) spreading model on networks.

What is now the individual risk to the different people living in this nursing home? If the home has access to two rapid COVID-19 viral tests, who should they be given to and why? In order to answer questions like this, we need to study stochastic models rather than deterministic ones.

Stability of control systems with feedback from energy harvesting sensors,"Nicholas J Watkins, Konstantinos Gatsis, Cameron Nowzari, George J Pappas",2017/12/7,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.02847,"In this paper, we study the problem of certifying the stability of a closed loop system which receives feedback from an energy harvesting sensor. This is important, as energy harvesting sensors are recharged stochastically, and may only be able to provide feedback intermittently. Thus, stabilizing plants with feedback provided by energy harvesting sensors is challenging in that the feedback signal is only available stochastically, complicating the analysis of the closed-loop system. As the main contribution of the paper, we show that for a broad class of energy harvesting processes and transmission policies, the system can be modeled as a Markov jump linear system (MJLS), which thereby enables a rigorous stability analysis. We discuss the types of transmission policies and energy harvesting processes which can be accommodated in detail, demonstrating the generality of the results.",2
Robust prediction and control of continuous-time epidemic processes,"Nicholas J Watkins, Cameron Nowzari, George J Pappas",2017/7,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.00742,"In this paper, we develop robust mechanisms for the prediction and control of a networked epidemic process. The work presented here is significant in that it addresses a longstanding open question in the field of control of networked epidemic processes by circumventing the need to heuristically approximate the system studied by mean-field models. This enables us to provide rigorous stochastic convergence guarantees on the epidemic model itself, improving over the mean-field type convergence results of most prior work. The prediction dynamics we construct follow from combining a multivariate comparison lemma, and the Fréchet approximation of joint probabilities. The controller we construct uses the prediction dynamics to compute control actions which guarantee exponential decay in the level of exposure and infection in the spreading graph, which in simulation are often less costly than heuristic control methods. As an application, we use the developed framework for optimizing the use of quarantines in containing the spread of an epidemic.",2

Proper modeling and analysis of spreading processes has been a longstanding area of research among many different fields including mathematical biology, physics, computer science, engineering, economics, and the social sciences. One of the earliest epidemic models conceived was by Daniel Bernoulli in 1760, which was motivated by studying the spreading of smallpox [1]. In addition to Bernoulli, there were many different researchers also working on mathematical epidemic models around this time [2]. These initial models were quite simplistic and the further development and study of such models dates back to the 1900s [3]–[6], where still simple models were studied to provide insight as to how various diseases can spread through a population. In recent years, we have seen a resurgence of interest in these problems as the concept of ‘networks’ becomes increasingly prevalent in modeling many different aspects of our world today. A more comprehensive review of the history of mathematical epidemiology can be found in [7],[8].",2
An agent-based distributed control policy for networked sir epidemics,"Mohammad Mubarak, Cameron Nowzari",2022/9/13,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.06250,"This paper revisits a longstanding problem of interest concerning the distributed control of an epidemic process on human contact networks.

A potentially even larger problem is such policies are notoriously brittle when confronted with small disturbances or uncooperative agents in the network. Unlike the vast majority of related works in this area, we employ a bottom-up agent-based modeling and control approach where we are inspired by principles of self-organization and emergence to better understand how effectively \textit{simple} control strategies can address this problem. More specifically, rather than attempting to design top-down (either centralized or decentralized) optimal control strategies, we aim to understand how simple strategies work in different conditions. More specifically, based on the \textbf{locally} available information to a particular person, how should that person make use of this information to better protect their self? How can that person socialize as much as possible while ensuring some desired level of safety? We show the optimal solution of this problem to be a form of threshold on the chance of infection of the neighbors of that person. Simulations illustrate our results.",1

When these conditions are not satisfied, we show how very simple simulators can still be used to both (i) design new multi-robot systems, and (ii) guide real-world swarming experiments towards certain emergent behaviors when the gap is very large. The key ideas are an iterative simulator-in-the-design-loop in which real-world experiments, simulator modifications, and simulated experiments are intimately coupled in a way that minds the gap without needing to shrink it, as well as the use of minimally viable phase diagrams to guide real world experiments.

In this chapter, we describe a bio-inspired framework for optimal allocation of resources to prevent spreading processes in complex cyber-physical networks. Our motivation is recent advancement on the problem of containing epidemics in human contact networks. The most popular dynamic epidemic model is the susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) model [5, 6]. In this model, a given population is divided into two compartments. The first compartment, called “susceptible”(S), contains individuals who are healthy, but susceptible to becoming infected. The second compartment is called “infected”(I) and contains individuals who are infected and able to recover from the disease. Individuals can transition from S to I as they become infected, and from I to S as they recover. In addition to the SIS model, there are many other models able to model more realistic spreading processes. This is often done by adding extra compartments representing a variety of disease stages. There are many works that analyze variations of the SIS model, such as extensions to higher number of disease states [7–13], or explicit modeling of birth and mortality rates [14, 15]. Stability results are obtained in [15–17] using Lyapunov analysis, or in [18] using Volterra integral models.

The available literature typically assumes that collisions can be avoided by adding a collision avoidance algorithm on top of an existing swarm behavior. Through an illustrative example in our experience replicating a particular behavior, we show that this can be difficult to achieve since the swarm behavior can be disrupted by collision avoidance.
