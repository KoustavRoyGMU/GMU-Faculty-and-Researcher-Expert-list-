Information behavior of international students settling in an unfamiliar geo‐spatial environment,"Chi Young Oh, Brian S Butler, Myeong Lee",2014/1/1,Journal Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology,"This paper presents the findings from a project about how international students seek and acquire information during their settlement in an unknown geo‐spatial environment. Through semi‐structured interviews, questionnaires, and cognitive mapping with twenty international students, this study examines their information needs, information sources, and settlement experiences in the host country. Findings of the study include their (1) focus on acquiring basic, survival‐related information; (2) active use of internet‐based information sources including online/mobile maps; (3) information behavior of wandering around and information encountering; (4) co‐national social networks playing a key role as information sources. Implications are discussed in ways to further our understanding of international students’ information behavior and promote its improvement.",36
Making Sense of Risk Information amidst Uncertainty: Individuals’ Perceived Risks Associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Kathleen H Pine, Myeong Lee, Samantha A Whitman, Yunan Chen, Kathryn Henne",2021/5/6,Book Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems," During a global pandemic such as COVID-19, laypeople bear a large burden of responsibility for assessing risks associated with COVID-19 and taking action to manage risks in their everyday lives, yet epidemic-related information is characterized by uncertainty and ambiguity. People perceive risks based on partial, changing information. We draw on crisis informatics research to examine the multiple types of risk people perceive in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, the information sources that inform perceptions of COVID-19 risks, and the challenges that people have in getting the information they need to understand risks, using qualitative interviews with individuals across the United States. Participants describe multiple pandemic-related threats, including illness, secondary health conditions, economic, socio-behavioral, and institutional risks.

How are Information Deserts Created? A Theory of Local Information Landscapes,"Myeong Lee, Brian S Butler",2019,Journal Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology (JASIST),"To understand information accessibility issues, research has examined human and technical factors by taking a socio‐technical view. While this view provides a profound understanding of how people seek, use, and access information, it often overlooks the larger structure of the information landscapes that shape people's information access. However, theorizing the information landscape of a local community at the community level is challenging because of the diverse contexts and users. One way to minimize the complexity is to focus on the materiality of information. By highlighting the material aspects of information, it becomes possible to understand the community‐level structure of local information. This paper develops a theory of local information landscapes (LIL theory) to conceptualize the material structure of local information. LIL theory adapts a concept of the virtual as an ontological view of the local …",22
Identifying Urban Neighborhood Names through User-Contributed Online Property Listings,"Grant McKenzie, Zheng Liu, Yingjie Hu, Myeong Lee",2018/9/26,Journal ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,"Neighborhoods are vaguely defined, localized regions that share similar characteristics. They are most often defined, delineated and named by the citizens that inhabit them rather than municipal government or commercial agencies. The names of these neighborhoods play an important role as a basis for community and sociodemographic identity, geographic communication and historical context. In this work, we take a data-driven approach to identifying neighborhood names based on the geospatial properties of user-contributed rental listings. Through a random forest ensemble learning model applied to a set of spatial statistics for all n-grams in listing descriptions, we show that neighborhood names can be uniquely identified within urban settings. We train a model based on data from Washington, DC, and test it on listings in Seattle, WA, and Montréal, QC. The results indicate that a model trained on housing data from one city can successfully identify neighborhood names in another. In addition, our approach identifies less common neighborhood names and suggestions of alternative or potentially new names in each city. These findings represent a first step in the process of urban neighborhood identification and delineation.",15
Heuristics for assessing computational archival science (CAS) research: the case of the Human Face of Big Data project,"Myeong Lee, Yuheng Zhang, Shiyun Chen, Edel Spencer, Jhon Dela Cruz, Hyeonggi Hong, Richard Marciano",2017/12/11,"Conference Big Data (Big Data), 2017 IEEE International Conference on","Computational Archival Science (CAS) has been proposed as a trans-disciplinary field that combines computational and archival thinking. To provide grounded evidence, a foundational paper explored eight initial themes that constitute potential building blocks [1]. In order for a CAS community to emerge, further studies are needed to test this framework. While the foundational paper for CAS provides a conceptual and theoretical basis of this new field, there is still a need to articulate useful guidelines and checkpoints that validate a CAS research agenda. In this position paper, we propose heuristics for assessing emerging CAS-related studies that researchers from traditional fields can use in their research design stage. The Human Face of Big Data project, a digital curation and interface design project for urban renewal data, is presented and analyzed to demonstrate the validity of the suggested heuristics.

Toward an Ecology Theory of Creativity in IT Products: A Study of Mobile Device Industry,"Ping Wang, Myeong Lee, Xu Meng, Brian Butler",2016,Conference Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS),"In a creative process, divergent thinking needs to be stimulated to generate novel ideas; yet these ideas must be synthesized to produce something valuable. Hence to foster creativity in developing IT products, creators need to manage the tension between novelty and value. Since the forces affecting the novelty-value tension often exist outside a creator's group or organization, we apply organizational ecology theory to propose an industry-level, ecological model for understanding the novelty of IT products. Analyzing data on 2,903 mobile devices developed by 156 firms worldwide over a tenyear period, we found that legitimation of the products in a market niche and competition between market niches enhanced product novelty. However, not all kinds of competition stimulated novelty. Competition within each niche hampered novelty. This ecological perspective contributes to creative IT/IS research and has the potential to bridge studies of creativity and digital innovation.",8
Towards understanding communication behavior changes during floods using cell phone data,"Lingzi Hong, Myeong Lee, Afra Mashhadi, Vanessa Frias-Martinez",2018,"Conference Social Informatics: 10th International Conference, SocInfo 2018, St. Petersburg, Russia, September 25-28, 2018, Proceedings, Part II 10","Natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods or tornadoes affect millions of individuals every year. As a result, governments spend millions of dollars in emergency response allocating resources to mitigate the damages. Effective resource allocation requires a deep understanding of how humans react when a disaster takes place. Due to the multiplicity of human behavior, however, it is not trivial to understand human behaviors at large scale during and after the disaster. In this paper, we explore the use of Call Detail Records (CDR) data to model people’s responses to flooding events from the communication perspective in Senegal. Specifically, we examine how different levels of flooding affect call volumes and communication network features. Our results show that individuals are more active in calling behaviors during flooding events than under normal conditions, which might imply their support-seeking …",7
Human Mobility during COVID-19 in the Context of Mild Social Distancing: Implications for Technological Interventions,"Myeong Lee, Seongkyu Lee, Seonghoon Kim, Noseong Park",2020/6/28,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.16965,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought both tangible and intangible damage to our society. Many researchers studied about its societal impacts in the countries that had implemented strong social distancing measures such as stay-at-home orders. Among them, human mobility has been studied extensively due to its importance in flattening the curve. However, mobility has not been actively studied in the context of mild social distancing. Insufficient understanding of human mobility in diverse contexts might provide limited implications for any technological interventions to alleviate the situation. To this end, we collected a dataset consisting of more than 1M daily smart device users in the third-largest city of South Korea, which has implemented mild social distancing policies. We analyze how COVID-19 shaped human mobility in the city from geographical, socio-economic, and socio-political perspectives. We also examine mobility changes for points of interest and special occasions such as transportation stations and the case of legislative elections. We identify a typology of populations through these analyses as a means to provide design implications for technological interventions. This paper contributes to social sciences through in-depth analyses of human mobility and to the CSCW community with new design challenges and potential implications.",5
Delay of routine health care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A theoretical model of individuals’ risk assessment and decision making,"Prakriti Shukla, Myeong Lee, Samantha Whitman, Kathleen Pine",2022/6/22,Journal Social Science & Medicine,"Delaying routine health care has been prevalent during the COIVD-19 pandemic. Macro-level data from this period reveals that U.S. patients under-utilized routine health care services such as primary care visits, preventative tests, screenings, routine optometry care, dental appointments, and visits for chronic disease management. Yet, there is a gap in research on how and why patients understand risks associated with seeking or delaying routing health care during an infectious disease pandemic. Our research addresses this gap based on semi-structured interviews with 40 participants living in regions across the United States. By building upon Unger-Saldaña and Infante-Castañeda's model of delayed health care, we extend this model by articulating how health care delays happen during an infectious disease pandemic. Specifically, we show how perceptions of uncertainty and subjective risk assessments …",4
A Tool for Estimating and Visualizing Poverty Maps,"Myeong Lee, Rachael Dottle, Carlos Espino, Imam Subkhan, Ariel Rokem, Afra Mashhadi",2017,Conference NetMob '17,""" Poverty maps"" are designed to simultaneously display the spatial distribution of welfare and different dimensions of poverty determinants. The plotting of such information on maps however heavily relies on data that is collected through infrequent national household surveys and censuses. However, due to the high cost associated with this type of data collection process, poverty maps are often inaccurate in capturing the current deprivation status. In this paper, we address this challenge by means of a methodology that relies on alternative data sources from which to derive up-to-date poverty indicators, at a very fine level of spatial granularity. We validate our methodology for the city of Milano and demonstrate how it could be used to implement a poverty mapping tool for policy makers.",4
This Is Not Just a Café: Toward Capturing the Dynamics of Urban Places,"Myeong Lee, Rosta Farzan, Brian S Butler",2016/4/16,Conference CitiLab@ ICWSM,"Social media has provided a huge amount of user-generated data in capturing urban dynamics. Among them, place-level human behavior has been largely detected through people’s check-in records at certain places. Conventionally, places are characterized by a set of pre-defined features, often specified by the owner of the places. In this paper, we argue that capturing socially-meaningful features and dynamics of an urban place may also be done by analyzing human activity traces. We explore the activity-centered representation of urban places as a foundation for understanding local neighborhoods at scale. We analyze activities from several venues using data from MeetUp, a popular local event organizing service. Then, Yelp’s business information was used to triangulate the analysis. The results suggest that strategies based on local event data have great potential for modeling socially-meaningful urban places at scale.",4
Crowdsourcing Behavior in Reporting Civic Issues: The Case of Boston’s 311 Systems,"Myeong Lee, Jieshu Wang, Shawn Janzen, Susan Winter, John Harlow",2021/8,Journal Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings (AOM),"Many cities in the United States use civic technologies like 311 systems as part of their public service systems for monitoring non-emergency civic issues. These systems have enhanced the city’s monitoring capability by diversifying communication channels. However, the data created through these systems is often biased because of differences in people’s use of technology (ie, digital divide) and individuals’ behavioral patterns in providing types of information to the systems. If civic data is used by local governments in making informed decisions, these data-driven services could be skewed towards the heavy technology users, and not reflect citizens’ diverse needs. If individuals share similar behavioral patterns or cultural norms by neighborhood in reporting civic issues, socio-economic or regional inequality could be exacerbated due to the uneven provision of service. This paper aims to explore these aspects of civic technologies by examining the relationship between community characteristics, individuals’ data contribution behavior, and the formation of data types. We report results based on Boston’s 311 data as a case study.",3
A theoretical analysis of independent business owners' preferences for informal information sources,"Joel Chan, Jonathan Brier, Zahra Farhadi, Myeong Lee, Shawn Janzen, Wei‐Wei Chi, Andrew Fellows, Susan Winter",2020/10,Journal Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology,"Independent business owners often prefer informal information sources to formal ones such as library collections. Part of these preferences is rational because contextual and application‐oriented information is usually available from informal sources, which are theoretically the best matches for this kind of information. This suggests that, in addition to outreach strategies, efforts to integrate informal sources of business‐relevant information can improve public libraries' ability to support independent business owners' information needs. Through interviews with business information providers and users, we explore the multi‐dimensional space of information needs in independent businesses.",2

Toward identifying values and tensions in designing a historically-sensitive data platform: a case-study on urban renewal,"Myeong Lee, Shiyun Chen, Yuheng Zhang, Edel Spencer, Richard Marciano",2018,"Conference Transforming Digital Worlds: 13th International Conference, iConference 2018, Sheffield, UK, March 25-28, 2018, Proceedings 13","Urban renewal was a national initiative from the 1960s through the 70s aimed at improving so-called “blighted” areas, and resulted in the displacement of many vibrant communities. While the underlying mechanisms of urban renewal have been examined, there have been very few data-driven, evidence-based studies that take into account the histories and interests of former residents. The “Human Face of Big Data” project started as a digital curation effort to design and develop a web-based platform that provides insights and analytics into the mechanisms of this process. However, it was found from user feedback that designing these kinds of platforms is not trivial; rather it needed to be carefully approached as diverse values and tensions exist surrounding the design of a historically-sensitive data system.

"Towards a Socio-technical System of Culturally Responsive Teaching: The Interplay between Individuals, Communities and Resources","Taylor Stevens, Myeong Lee, Olga Gkountouna",2022/3/28,"Conference ACM CHI Workshop on ""There is no justice, just us"": Making Mosaics of Justice in Social Justice HCI","Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT) is a set of instructional practices that acknowledges and incorporates students’ identities and backgrounds into the classroom in a way that makes learning more effective and relevant for culturally, rhetorically, and ethnically diverse students. CRT helps to create a space where (1) all students are respected and empowered, and (2) their differences are acknowledged, discussed, and incorporated in a meaningful manner. This not only fosters a culturally responsive classroom, but one that supports social justice. Both CRT and social justice in education aim to expand students’ perspectives of people from diverse backgrounds, to help them relate and empathize with others, and also embrace their own identities. Researchers discovered that educators face challenges with both CRT- and social justice-informed teaching, such as cultural unfamiliarity and a lack of training. As a means to overcome these challenges and facilitate CRT- and justice-informed education, we propose the design of a socio-technical system of CRT practices by creating a ""CRT agency"" between teachers in diverse locations and expertise.",1
The Effects of Socioeconomic Deprivation on Public Library Book Circulation: A Community-level Study,"Jongwook Lee, Woojin Kang, Myeong Lee",2021,Journal Journal of the Korean Society for Library and Information Science,"This study analyzes the effects of community-level socioeconomic deprivations (SED) on public libraries' book circulation in the Seoul metropolitan area. The study design draws upon the theory of local information landscapes, which explains the relationship between community characteristics and information behavior. Using four-year (2015-2018) open government and public library circulation data, we constructed a socioeconomic deprivation index by adjusting a multi-dimensional deprivation index and generated other variables. Multi-level robust linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between SED and public library circulation. In addition, we tested the moderating effects of the library collection size and the number of libraries per unit area, respectively, on library circulation. The results show that there is a significant negative relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and library circulation rate. Also, we found that the size of the library collection negatively moderates the effects of SED in areas with a large number of books, and the number of libraries per unit area was positvely related to the library book circulation, not moderating the effects of SED. These findings suggest that public libraries and policymakers should consider community characteristics in designing strategic plans for public libraries.",1

However, such technical efficiency from digital channel use, to our surprise, exacerbated the disparities between high-income and low-income communities in request volume. This unexpected finding may be explained by the uneven channel use trajectories and distributions of repeat users in different communities, as our additional analysis shows. These results not only have exposed previously hidden inequalities but also may help reconcile different theories of distributive justice. Practically speaking, technical efficiency and social justice should be balanced when employing digital technology in coproducing government services.",

Toward Understanding Civic Data Bias in 311 Systems: An Information Deserts Perspective,"Myeong Lee, Jieshu Wang, Erik Johnston, John Harlow, Eric Gordon, Shawn Janzen, Susan Winter",2020,"Publisher CSCW Workshop on Civic Technologies: Research, Practice, and Open Challenges","While civic technologies for public issues and services such as 311 systems are widely adopted in many U.S. cities, the impact of the emerging civic technologies and their data-level dynamics are unclear. Because the provision patterns of civic issues to technological systems are different across neighborhoods and populations, it is difficult for city officials to understand whether the provided data itself reflects civic issues. Also, the disparities in the information provided to civic technologies in different neighborhoods may exacerbate the existing inequality. To understand how civic data is created and how people's use of civic technologies plays a role as an intermediary process in shaping community performances, we take an information deserts perspective in studying 311 systems. The concept of information deserts is informed by a material understanding of local information landscapes, making it possible to distinguish local information's structural features from its social-construction process. Based on this theoretical lens, we suggest new opportunities for civic technology and data research.",

The ways people perceive geospatial places can be characterized in terms of their tendency to rely on specific landmarks or symbolic addresses. In this study, we use an online survey and an online place recognition game to test the hypothesis that high-context individuals will perceive urban places in terms of landmarks rather than symbolic addresses. The results suggest that high-and low-context is not …",

On Information Deserts: A Research Agenda for Local Community Information Landscapes,Myeong Lee,"To understand information accessibility issues, it is necessary to consider not only human information behavior, but also how information is created and provisioned to social entities and infrastructures. This need for holistic approaches becomes more apparent in local community settings because community-related information is largely embedded in urban places and technical infrastructures, ie, community-level material entities. This paper proposes a research agenda based on a conceptual model of local community information landscapes that takes socio-technical views in different scales to better understand the phenomena and issues surrounding information accessibility. Specifically, the proposed model adopts a concept of the virtual (de Souza e Silva & Sutko, 2011) for the ontological view of interplays between urban infrastructures, places, and people and explains how information inequalities can be …",Scholar articles On Information Deserts: A Research Agenda for Local Community Information LandscapesM LeeRelated articles ,"To understand information accessibility issues, it is necessary to consider not only human information behavior, but also how information is created and provisioned to social entities and infrastructures.
