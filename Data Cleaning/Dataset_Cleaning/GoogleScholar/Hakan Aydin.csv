Imprecise computation and Increased-Reward-with-Increased-Service models fall within the scope of this-framework. In this paper, we address the reward-based scheduling problem for periodic tasks.

Specifically, the primary and backup tasks are first mapped in a mixed manner to both processors. Then, the POED algorithm is used to schedule the mixed tasks on each processor, where primary tasks are executed as soon as possible while backup tasks as late as possible to reduce the overlapped execution of primary and backup copies of the same task and thus reduce energy consumption. The online scheme that considers the additional slack from the cancellation of backup tasks and early completion of primary tasks is further explored.

We also propose a new and simple priority assignment policy called CPRatio that considers both task criticality and timing constraints to improve the schedulability of mixed-criticality task sets.

Optimal Speed Scaling Algorithms under Speed Change Constraints,"Zhi Zhang, Fei Li, Hakan Aydin",2011/9/2,"Conference High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC), 2011 IEEE 13th International Conference on","In this paper, we investigate energy-aware real-time scheduling algorithms with speed change constraints. A processor is equipped with variable clock frequency (speedy) feature and is used to schedule a set of given jobs with deadlines. Each speed change involves time/energy overhead and recent studies show that it also impacts negatively the processor's lifetime reliability. Motivated by this, we study theoretical energy-aware scheduling problems with consideration of number and cost of speed changes. We associate a cost with each speed change to reflect its negative impact on the processor's lifetime reliability. We design speed schedules to satisfy all jobs' deadlines and optimize the energy consumption and the total cost incurred due to speed changes. Four related problems based on this framework are considered. We develop algorithms that perform arbitrarily close to the optimal and we also analyze …",7
Flexible real-time transmission scheduling for wireless networks with non-deterministic workloads,"Arda Gumusalan, Robert Simon, Hakan Aydin",2018/5/1,Journal Ad Hoc Networks,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are increasingly used in industrial applications such as the Internet-of-Things, Smart City technologies and critical infrastructure monitoring. Industrial WSNs often operate in a cluster or star configuration. To ensure real-time and predictable performance, link access is typically managed using time-slotted superframe methods. These methods generally use static and potentially inefficient slot assignments. In this paper, we propose to dynamically readjust time slot lengths as a technique to minimize overall energy consumption. Our approach combines real-time performance guarantees with energy conservation methods through a set of dynamic modulation based adaptive packet transmission scheduling algorithms that are designed to reclaim unused slot times. To support our reclaiming method in a wireless environment we introduce a novel low-power listening technique called …",6

Dynamic modulation scaling enabled multi-hop topology control for time critical wireless sensor networks,"Arda Gumusalan, Robert Simon, Hakan Aydin",2019,Journal Wireless Networks,"The previous work on connection driven topology control has shown that it has significant potential to reduce energy consumption of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Dynamic Modulation Scaling (DMS) which is a technique that manages transmission power levels in order to change the number of bits encoded per symbol has a direct impact on connection driven topology control. In this paper we investigate the transmission scheduling of multi-hop real-time WSNs equipped with DMS enabled radio chips while taking the effect of DMS on topology control into account. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper that addresses this issue. The current work on DMS enabled WSN tend to rely on theoretical DMS models to predict network performance metrics.

On minimizing expected energy usage of embedded wireless systems with probabilistic workloads,"Maryam Bandari, Robert Simon, Hakan Aydin",2016/9/30,Journal Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems,"A large number of embedded wireless systems must handle complex and time-varying computational and communication workloads. Further, a significant number of these systems support real-time applications. Most of the existing energy management studies for such systems have focused on relatively simple scenarios that assume deterministic workloads, and only consider a limited range of energy management techniques, such as Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS). Our paper addresses these deficiencies by proposing a general purpose probabilistic workload model for computation and communication. To account for the importance of radio energy consumption, we also analyse Dynamic Modulation Scaling (DMS), an often overlooked method for energy management. We define several energy control algorithms, including an optimal combined DVS–DMS approach, and evaluate these algorithms under a wide …",4

Competitive analysis of energy-constrained real-time scheduling,"Vinay Devadas, Fei Li, Hakan Aydin",2009/7/1,Conference 2009 21st Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems,"In this paper, we undertake the competitive analysis of the online real-time scheduling problems under a given hard energy constraint. Specifically, we derive worst-case performance bounds that apply to any online algorithm, when compared to an optimal algorithm that has the knowledge of the input sequence in advance. First, by focusing on uniform value-density settings, we prove that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive factor greater than 1 - e max /E, where e max  is the upper bound on the size of any job and E is the available energy budget. Then we propose a variant of EDF algorithm, EC-EDF, that is able to achieve this upper bound. We show that a priori information about the largest job size in the actual input sequence makes possible the design of a semi-online algorithm EC-EDF* which achieves a constant competitive factor of 0.5. This turns out to be the best achievable competitive factor in …",4
Periodic Reward-Based Scheduling and Its Application to Power-Aware Real-Time Systems,"Hakan Aydin, Rami Melhem, Daniel Mossé",2004,"Journal Handbook of Scheduling: Algorithms, Models, and Performance Analysis","In this chapter, we introduce Reward-based and Power-aware scheduling frameworks. Reward-based scheduling is based on the principle of trading precision for timeliness and it is particularly suitable for real-time applications when worst-case guarantees cannot be provided due to overload conditions and/or faults. Power-aware scheduling exploits the convex relation between the CPU speed and the power dissipation: it is targeted towards saving energy through the reduction of the CPU speed and the supply voltage. However, utmost care must be exercised in order to still satisfy the timing constraints when using the reduced speed. We show that two frameworks are closely related and we provide an overview of the major research findings in these areas for periodic real-time applications.",4
Work-in-Progress: Preference-Oriented Scheduling in Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems,"Qin Xia, Dakai Zhu, Hakan Aydin",2018/12/11,Conference 2018 IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS),"For a set of real-time tasks that have mixed preference of being executed at early or late times before their deadlines, we have recently studied both earliest-deadline based and fixed-priority preference-oriented (PO) scheduling algorithms for uniprocessor systems. In this work, focusing on multiprocessor real-time systems, we study the foundational guidelines to design partition-based PO scheduling algorithms for tasks with mixed preference requirements. In particular, through a concrete example, we illustrate that the harmonicity of tasks' periods should be incorporated when making scheduling decisions in addition to their execution preferences to obtain favorable schedules that better fulfill tasks' preference requirements. Based on such guidelines, we design a period-aware preference-oriented (PAPO) partitioned scheduling algorithm and discuss several variations by considering harmonicity as well as …",3

We target performance-sensitive applications that have to collectively send their information to a cluster head by a predefined deadline. The nodes are equipped with Dynamic Modulation Scaling (DMS)-capable wireless radios. DMS provides a tuning knob, allowing us to trade off communication latency with energy consumption. We consider two optimization objectives, maximizing total energy reserves and maximizing the minimum energy level across all nodes. For both objectives, we show that optimal solutions can be obtained by solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming problems. We also develop several fast heuristics that are shown to provide approximate solutions experimentally.",2
On Task Period Assignment in Multiprocessor Real-Time Control Systems,"Abhishek Roy, Hakan Aydin, Dakai Zhu",2016/10/19,Conference Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Real-Time Networks and Systems,"In real-time control systems, a well-known problem is the period assignment to individual tasks, in order to minimize the overall control cost while guaranteeing the task deadlines. In general, the control cost decreases in convex fashion with decreasing periods (increasing invocation rates). Many real-time control systems are increasingly implemented on multiprocessor platforms due to the increased performance requirements. In this paper, we consider the optimal period assignment problem on a homogeneous multiprocessor platform. The problem is intractable in nature. We analyze the performance of the approaches that first partition the tasks, before assigning periods to optimize overall cost on each CPU locally. Then we propose a technique which assigns the periods optimally by reducing the problem to a single-processor problem setting in the first step, and then applying the partitioning algorithms in the …",2

These studies tend to rely on theoretical or simulation DMS models to predict network performance metrics.

Periodic charging scheme for fixed-priority real-time systems with renewable energy,"Mario Bambagini, Hakan Aydin",2014/6/18,Conference Proceedings of the 9th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems (SIES 2014),"Energy harvesting systems are gaining increasing importance in the embedded systems domain, as they provide an effective solution to bridge the gap between the energy supply and demand.

Preference-Oriented Scheduling Framework for Periodic Real-Time Tasks,"Yifeng Guo, Hang Su, Dakai Zhu, Hakan Aydin",2013,"Publisher Technical Report CS-TR-2013-007, Dept. of Computer Science, Univ. of Texas at San Antonio","We consider a set of real-time periodic tasks where some tasks are preferably executed as soon as possible (ASAP) and others as late as possible (ALAP) while still meeting their deadlines. After introducing the idea of preference-oriented (PO) execution, we formally define the concept of PO-optimality. For fully-loaded systems (with 100% utilization), we first propose a PO-optimal scheduler, namely ASAP-ensured earliest deadline (SEED), by focusing on ASAP tasks where the optimality of tasks’ ALAP preference is achieved implicitly due to the harmonicity of the PO-optimal schedules for such systems. Then, for underutilized systems (with less than 100% utilization), we show the discrepancies between different PO-optimal schedules. By extending SEED, we propose a generalized preference-oriented earliest deadline (POED) scheduler that can obtain a PO-optimal schedule for any schedulable task set. We further evaluate the proposed PO-optimal schedulers through extensive simulations. The results show that, comparing to that of the well-known EDF scheduler, the scheduling overheads of SEED and POED are higher (but still manageable) due to the additional consideration of tasks’ preferences. However, SEED and POED can achieve the preference-oriented execution objectives in a more successful way than EDF.",1
