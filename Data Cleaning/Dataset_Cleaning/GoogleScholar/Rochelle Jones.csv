Physical ergonomic and mental workload factors of mobile learning affecting performance of adult distance learners: Student perspective,Rochelle Jones,2009,Institution University of Central Florida,"Distance education is the fastest growing educational modality because of advances information technology has made over the past 25 years. Adult learners have become the fastest growing population in distance education. Adult learners, through technical tools and devices they use on the job, have become more digitally literate and mobile, making the ability to access class work on the go a necessity. Mobile learning or m-learning (learning that uses wireless, portable, mobile computing, and communication devices) is becoming an extension of distance learning, providing a channel for students to learn, communicate, and access educational material outside the traditional classroom environment. For adult learners, this modality allows them to take advantage of accessing material using mobile devices they use for job related activities. Despite the portability and readiness to information mobile devices provide …",22
Project management for executing distance education programs,"Adedeji B Badiru, Rochelle R Jones",2012/7/1,Journal Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice,"Recent technological developments, shrinking resources, and rising industry interest in sustainable workforce development provide a strong impetus for distance education (DE) or distance learning (DL) investments. Because of the multiplicity of efforts involved in planning and executing a DE program, it is imperative that organizations view this nontraditional mode of knowledge transfer from a project management perspective. DE has become a growth industry not only in academia but also in business and industry interested in sustainable workforce development. The military, in particular, has been placing more emphasis on DE programs in recent years because of the increasingly global locations of military personnel and shrinking resource without a reduction in the need for education and training. For example, the US Navy Postgraduate School (NPS) and US Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) offer a …",9
A systems framework for distance learning in engineering graduate programs,"Adedeji B Badiru, Rochelle R Jones",2012/6,Journal Systems Engineering,"Distance learning (DL) is undergoing a rapid growth in academia, business, industry, and the military. Recent technological developments in computer‐based training, along with shrinking internal resources, and rising industry interest in sustainable workforce development, provide a strong impetus for DL investments. Due to the multiplicity of efforts involved in planning and executing a DL program, it is imperative that organizations view this nontraditional mode of knowledge transfer from a systems perspective. This paper presents a coordination‐centric systems framework for implementing a DL program using the SIMILAR systems engineering process. The paper also suggests linking SIMILAR to two complementary models, Triple C and D‐E‐J‐I, to enhance the overall systems approach. Implementing DL from a systems view aids in identifying the interrelating components, resource interfaces, and …",9
EFFECTIVE DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH INDUSTRY-UNIVERSITY COLLABORATION,"Adedeji B Badiru, Rochelle R Jones",2014,Journal Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.,"The potential instructional cost savings to be derived from distance learning (DL) has fueled the interest for new asynchronous programs around the world. Instructional efficiency and effectiveness are also touted as additional benefits to be derived from DL programs. However, in spite of that interest, there are documented cases of DL failing to reach its full potential due to a number of project-centric issues ranging from people to tools to process nuances. The premise of this paper is more can be derived from DL through the application of systems engineering and project management techniques. The requirements for communication, cooperation, and coordination throughout the spectrum of any DL initiative are important. Industry-university collaboration processes are necessary to achieving bilateral benefits. This paper presents selected systems engineering and project management techniques that are helpful for …",
