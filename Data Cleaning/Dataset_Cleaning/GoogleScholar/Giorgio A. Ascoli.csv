Petilla terminology: nomenclature of features of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex,2008/7,Nature Reviews Neuroscience,Volume 9,"Neuroscience produces a vast amount of data from an enormous diversity of neurons. A neuronal classification system is essential to organize such data and the knowledge that is derived from them. Classification depends on the unequivocal identification of the features that distinguish one type of neuron from another. The problems inherent in this are particularly acute when studying cortical interneurons. To tackle this, we convened a representative group of researchers to agree on a set of terms to describe the anatomical, physiological and molecular features of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex. The resulting terminology might provide a stepping stone towards a future classification of these complex and heterogeneous cells. Consistent adoption will be important for the success of such an initiative, and we also encourage the active involvement of the broader scientific community in the dynamic …",1541

This article describes a possible taxonomical solution for classifying GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex based on a novel, web-based interactive system that allows experts to classify neurons with pre-determined criteria. Using Bayesian analysis and clustering algorithms on the resulting data, we investigated the suitability of several anatomical terms and neuron names for cortical GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, we show that supervised classification models could automatically categorize interneurons in agreement with experts' assignments. These results demonstrate a practical and objective approach to the naming, characterization and classification of neurons based on community consensus.",794
NeuroMorpho.

In this paper, we report for the first time that differences in dendritic structure within the same morphological class can have a dramatic influence on the firing rate and firing mode (spiking versus bursting and type of bursting). Our method consisted of converting morphological measurements from three-dimensional neuroanatomical data of CA3 pyramidal cells into a computational simulator format. In the simulation, active channels were distributed evenly across the cells so that the electrophysiological differences observed in the neurons would only be due to morphological differences.

Feed-forward inhibition as a buffer of the neuronal input-output relation,"Michele Ferrante, Michele Migliore, Giorgio A Ascoli",2009/10/20,Journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"Neuronal processing depends on the input-output (I/O) relation between the frequency of synaptic stimulation and the resultant axonal firing rate. The all-or-none properties of spike generation and active membrane mechanisms can make the neuronal I/O relation very steep. The ensuing nearly bimodal behavior may severely limit information coding, as minimal input fluctuations within the expected natural variability could cause neuronal output to jump between quiescence and maximum firing rate. Here, using biophysically and anatomically realistic computational models of individual neurons, we demonstrate that feed-forward inhibition, a ubiquitous mechanism in which inhibitory interneurons and their target cells are activated by the same excitatory input, can change a steeply sigmoid I/O curve into a double-sigmoid typical of buffer systems.

Local control of postinhibitory rebound spiking in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites,"Giorgio A Ascoli, Sonia Gasparini, Virginia Medinilla, Michele Migliore",2010/5/5,Journal Journal of Neuroscience,"Postinhibitory rebound spiking is characteristic of several neuron types and brain regions, where it sustains spontaneous activity and central pattern generation. However, rebound spikes are rarely observed in the principal cells of the hippocampus under physiological conditions. We report that CA1 pyramidal neurons support rebound spikes mediated by hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih), and normally masked by A-type potassium channels (KA). In both experiments and computational models, KA blockage or reduction consistently resulted in a somatic action potential upon release from hyperpolarizing injections in the soma or main apical dendrite. Rebound spiking was systematically abolished by the additional blockage or reduction of Ih. Since the density of both KA and Ih increases in these cells with the distance from the soma, such “latent” mechanism may be most effective in the distal dendrites …",75

A comparative computer simulation of dendritic morphology,"Duncan E Donohue, Giorgio A Ascoli",2008/6/6,Journal PLoS computational biology,"Computational modeling of neuronal morphology is a powerful tool for understanding developmental processes and structure-function relationships. We present a multifaceted approach based on stochastic sampling of morphological measures from digital reconstructions of real cells. We examined how dendritic elongation, branching, and taper are controlled by three morphometric determinants: Branch Order, Radius, and Path Distance from the soma. Virtual dendrites were simulated starting from 3,715 neuronal trees reconstructed in 16 different laboratories, including morphological classes as diverse as spinal motoneurons and dentate granule cells. Several emergent morphometrics were used to compare real and virtual trees. Relating model parameters to Branch Order best constrained the number of terminations for most morphological classes, except pyramidal cell apical trees, which were better described by a dependence on Path Distance. In contrast, bifurcation asymmetry was best constrained by Radius for apical, but Path Distance for basal trees. All determinants showed similar performance in capturing total surface area, while surface area asymmetry was best determined by Path Distance. Grouping by other characteristics, such as size, asymmetry, arborizations, or animal species, showed smaller differences than observed between apical and basal, pointing to the biological importance of this separation. Hybrid models using combinations of the determinants confirmed these trends and allowed a detailed characterization of morphological relations.

This review covers neuromorphological research that analyzes shape and size to elucidate their functional role for different neuron types.

Using model neurons with both highly simplified and real morphological structures (from a single cylindrical dendrite to a hippocampal granule cell, CA1 pyramidal cell, spinal motoneuron, and retinal ganglion neurons) we found that SE of excitatory inputs decreases with the distance from the soma and active nonlinear properties of the dendrites can counterbalance this global effect of attenuation. This phenomenon is frequency dependent, with a more prominent gain in SE observed at lower levels of background input–output neuronal activity. In contrast, there are no significant differences in SE between passive and active dendrites under higher frequencies of background activity.

Statistical determinants of dendritic morphology in hippocampal pyramidal neurons: A hidden Markov model,"Alexei V Samsonovich, Giorgio A Ascoli",2005,Journal Hippocampus,"Dendritic structure is traditionally characterized by distributions and interrelations of morphometric parameters, such as Sholl‐like plots of the number of branches versus dendritic path distance.

In this work, we assemble a small number of standard geometrical parameters measured from experimental data in a simple stochastic algorithm to describe the dendrograms of hippocampal pyramidal cells. The model, consistent with the hidden Markov framework, is feedforward, local, and causal. It relies on two “hidden” local variables: the expected number of terminal tips in a given subtree, and the current path distance from the soma.

Metrics for comparing neuronal tree shapes based on persistent homology,"Yanjie Li, Dingkang Wang, Giorgio A Ascoli, Partha Mitra, Yusu Wang",2017/8/15,Journal PloS one,"As more and more neuroanatomical data are made available through efforts such as NeuroMorpho.Org and FlyCircuit.org, the need to develop computational tools to facilitate automatic knowledge discovery from such large datasets becomes more urgent. One fundamental question is how best to compare neuron structures, for instance to organize and classify large collection of neurons. We aim to develop a flexible yet powerful framework to support comparison and classification of large collection of neuron structures efficiently. Specifically we propose to use a topological persistence-based feature vectorization framework. Existing methods to vectorize a neuron (i.e, convert a neuron to a feature vector so as to support efficient comparison and/or searching) typically rely on statistics or summaries of morphometric information, such as the average or maximum local torque angle or partition asymmetry. These simple summaries have limited power in encoding global tree structures. Based on the concept of topological persistence recently developed in the field of computational topology, we vectorize each neuron structure into a simple yet informative summary. In particular, each type of information of interest can be represented as a descriptor function defined on the neuron tree, which is then mapped to a simple persistence-signature. Our framework can encode both local and global tree structure, as well as other information of interest (electrophysiological or dynamical measures), by considering multiple descriptor functions on the neuron. The resulting persistence-based signature is potentially more informative than simple statistical summaries …",64
Neuroanatomical algorithms for dendritic modelling,Giorgio A Ascoli,2002/1/1,Journal Network: Computation in Neural Systems,"The complexity and variability of dendritic morphology constitutes a fascinating challenge to the investigation of the structure-activity-function relationship in the nervous system.

The key idea is to design a stochastic algorithm to generate digital structures that are statistically indistinguishable from those of real neurons of a given morphological class. The set of parameters used by this algorithm would then constitute a complete and accurate description of that morphological class.

Principal semantic components of language and the measurement of meaning,"Alexei V Samsonovic, Giorgio A Ascoli",2010/6/11,Journal PloS one,"Metric systems for semantics, or semantic cognitive maps, are allocations of words or other representations in a metric space based on their meaning. Existing methods for semantic mapping, such as Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, are based on paradigms involving dissimilarity metrics. They typically do not take into account relations of antonymy and yield a large number of domain-specific semantic dimensions. Here, using a novel self-organization approach, we construct a low-dimensional, context-independent semantic map of natural language that represents simultaneously synonymy and antonymy. Emergent semantics of the map principal components are clearly identifiable: the first three correspond to the meanings of “good/bad” (valence), “calm/excited” (arousal), and “open/closed” (freedom), respectively. The semantic map is sufficiently robust to allow the automated extraction of synonyms and antonyms not originally in the dictionaries used to construct the map and to predict connotation from their coordinates. The map geometric characteristics include a limited number (∼4) of statistically significant dimensions, a bimodal distribution of the first component, increasing kurtosis of subsequent (unimodal) components, and a U-shaped maximum-spread planar projection. Both the semantic content and the main geometric features of the map are consistent between dictionaries (Microsoft Word and Princeton's WordNet), among Western languages (English, French, German, and Spanish), and with previously established psychometric measures. By defining the semantics of its dimensions, the constructed map …",62

The geometry of individual neurons also varies substantially even within the same cell class. Moreover, specific histological, imaging, and reconstruction methodologies can differentially affect morphometric measures. The quantitative characterization of neuronal arbors is necessary for in-depth understanding of the structure-function relationship in nervous systems. The large collection of community-contributed digitally reconstructed neurons available at NeuroMorpho.Org constitutes a “big data” research opportunity for neuroscience discovery beyond the approaches typically pursued in single laboratories. To illustrate these potential and related challenges, we present a database-wide statistical analysis of dendritic arbors enabling the quantification of major morphological similarities and differences across broadly adopted metadata categories. Furthermore, we adopt a complementary unsupervised approach based on clustering and dimensionality reduction to identify the main morphological parameters leading to the most statistically informative structural classification. We find that specific combinations of measures related to branching density, overall size, tortuosity, bifurcation angles, arbor flatness, and topological asymmetry can capture anatomically and functionally relevant features of dendritic trees. The reported results only represent a small fraction of the relationships available for data exploration and hypothesis testing enabled by sharing of digital morphological reconstructions.",61

Neuroinformatics grand challenges,Giorgio A Ascoli,2008/3,Source Neuroinformatics,"The conference on Neural Circuit Reconstruction recently held at the Janelia Farm research campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (www. hhmi. org/janelia/conf-007. html) dramatically exposed the need and urgency to advance towards the automated digital tracing of neural arbors. The scientific problem was agreed to be of great importance and a bottleneck in fundamental research endeavors. At the same time, a mismatch became apparent between the confidence of computational scientists that the problem is very solvable (if not already solved) and the frustration of experimental neuroscientists with the practical limits and inadequacy of the existing solutions. In practice, despite several commercially and academically available programs for automated reconstruction, the vast majority of axons and dendrites are still traced manually.

Genetic single neuron anatomy reveals fine granularity of cortical axo-axonic cells,"Xiaojun Wang, Jason Tucciarone, Siqi Jiang, Fangfang Yin, Bor-Shuen Wang, Dingkang Wang, Yao Jia, Xueyan Jia, Yuxin Li, Tao Yang, Zhengchao Xu, Masood A Akram, Yusu Wang, Shaoqun Zeng, Giorgio A Ascoli, Partha Mitra, Hui Gong, Qingming Luo, Z Josh Huang",2019/3/12,Journal Cell reports,"Parsing diverse nerve cells into biological types is necessary for understanding neural circuit organization. Morphology is an intuitive criterion for neuronal classification and a proxy of connectivity, but morphological diversity and variability often preclude resolving the granularity of neuron types. Combining genetic labeling with high-resolution, large-volume light microscopy, we established a single neuron anatomy platform that resolves, registers, and quantifies complete neuron morphologies in the mouse brain. We discovered that cortical axo-axonic cells (AACs), a cardinal GABAergic interneuron type that controls pyramidal neuron (PyN) spiking at axon initial segments, consist of multiple subtypes distinguished by highly laminar-specific soma position and dendritic and axonal arborization patterns. Whereas the laminar arrangements of AAC dendrites reflect differential recruitment by input streams, the laminar …",39
Potential synaptic connectivity of different neurons onto pyramidal cells in a 3D reconstruction of the rat hippocampus,"Deepak Ropireddy, Giorgio A Ascoli",2011/7/4,Journal Frontiers in neuroinformatics,"Most existing connectomic data and ongoing efforts focus either on individual synapses (e.g., with electron microscopy) or on regional connectivity (tract tracing). An individual pyramidal cell (PC) extends thousands of synapses over macroscopic distances (∼cm). The contrasting requirements of high-resolution and large field of view make it too challenging to acquire the entire synaptic connectivity for even a single typical cortical neuron. Light microscopy can image whole neuronal arbors and resolve dendritic branches. Analyzing connectivity in terms of close spatial appositions between axons and dendrites could thus bridge the opposite scales, from synaptic level to whole systems. In the mammalian cortex, structural plasticity of spines and boutons makes these “potential synapses” functionally relevant to learning capability and memory capacity. To date, however, potential synapses have only been mapped in the surrounding of a neuron and relative to its local orientation rather than in a system-level anatomical reference. Here we overcome this limitation by estimating the potential connectivity of different neurons embedded into a detailed 3D reconstruction of the rat hippocampus. Axonal and dendritic trees were oriented with respect to hippocampal cytoarchitecture according to longitudinal and transversal curvatures. We report the potential connectivity onto PC dendrites from the axons of a dentate granule cell, three CA3 PCs, one CA2 PC, and 13 CA3b interneurons. The numbers, densities, and distributions of potential synapses were analyzed in each sub-region (e.g., CA3 vs. CA1), layer (e.g., oriens vs. radiatum), and septo-temporal …",39

"The conscious self: Ontology, epistemology and the mirror quest","Alexei V Samsonovich, Giorgio A Ascoli",2005/1/1,Source Cortex,"Here we address the notion of the self as the subject of experience, in contrast with its other popular meanings of a state of self-awareness, a body image, or a narrative center. In this perspective, the main player is not consciousness per se(the famous “hard problem”), but its subject. We start by showing that the self as the subject of immediate self-awareness cannot be conceived as an illusion. Then we formulate axioms of the self-concept based on the framework that Chalmers initially developed for consciousness. Using a thought experiments (the “mirror quest”), we show that this framework may require corrections in order to accommodate the subject. We analyze several possibilities that lead to a novel doctrine of “subjective nonreductive functionalism”. As an epistemological model, this position has further important implications for brain sciences.",37

Cognitive Map Dimensions of the Human Value System Extracted from Natural,"Alexei V Samsonovich, Giorgio A Ascoli",2007,"Journal Advances in artificial general intelligence: Concepts, architectures and algorithms","The notion of a human value system can be quantified as a cognitive map, the dimensions of which capture the semantics of concepts and the associated values. This can be done, if one knows (i) how to define the dimensions of the map, and (ii) how to allocate concepts in those dimensions. Regarding the first question, experimental studies with linguistic material using psychometrics have revealed that valence, arousal and dominance are primary dimensions characterizing human values. The same or similar dimensions are used in popular models of emotions and affects. In these studies, the choice of principal dimensions, as well as scoring concepts, was based on subjective reports or psycho-physiological measurements. Can a cognitive map of human values be constructed without testing human subjects? Here we show that the answer is positive, using generally available dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms. By applying a simple statistical-mechanic model to English and French dictionaries, we constructed multidimensional cognitive maps that capture the semantics of words. We calculated the principal dimensions of the resultant maps and found their semantics consistent across two languages as well as with previously known main cognitive dimensions. These results suggest that the linguistically derived cognitive map of the human value system is language-invariant and, being closely related to psychometrically derived maps, is likely to reflect fundamental aspects of the human mind.",35

"Sharing neuron data: carrots, sticks, and digital records",Giorgio A Ascoli,2015/10/8,Journal PLoS biology,"Routine data sharing is greatly benefiting several scientific disciplines, such as molecular biology, particle physics, and astronomy. Neuroscience data, in contrast, are still rarely shared, greatly limiting the potential for secondary discovery and the acceleration of research progress. Although the attitude toward data sharing is non-uniform across neuroscience subdomains, widespread adoption of data sharing practice will require a cultural shift in the community. Digital reconstructions of axonal and dendritic morphology constitute a particularly “sharable” kind of data. The popularity of the public repository NeuroMorpho.Org demonstrates that data sharing can benefit both users and contributors. Increased data availability is also catalyzing the grassroots development and spontaneous integration of complementary resources, research tools, and community initiatives. Even in this rare successful subfield, however, more data are still unshared than shared. Our experience as developers and curators of NeuroMorpho.Org suggests that greater transparency regarding the expectations and consequences of sharing (or not sharing) data, combined with public disclosure of which datasets are shared and which are not, may expedite the transition to community-wide data sharing.",34

Name-calling in the hippocampus (and beyond): coming to terms with neuron types and properties,"David J Hamilton, Diek W Wheeler, CM White, CL Rees, Alexander O Komendantov, Maurizio Bergamino, Giorgio A Ascoli",2017/3,Journal Brain informatics,"Widely spread naming inconsistencies in neuroscience pose a vexing obstacle to effective communication within and across areas of expertise. This problem is particularly acute when identifying neuron types and their properties. Hippocampome.org is a web-accessible neuroinformatics resource that organizes existing data about essential properties of all known neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation. Hippocampome.org links evidence supporting the assignment of a property to a type with direct pointers to quotes and figures. Mining this knowledge from peer-reviewed reports reveals the troubling extent of terminological ambiguity and undefined terms. Examples span simple cases of using multiple synonyms and acronyms for the same molecular biomarkers (or other property) to more complex cases of neuronal naming. New publications often use different terms without mapping them to previous terms. As a result, neurons of the same type are assigned disparate names, while neurons of different types are bestowed the same name. Furthermore, non-unique properties are frequently used as names, and several neuron types are not named at all. In order to alleviate this nomenclature confusion regarding hippocampal neuron types and properties, we introduce a new functionality of Hippocampome.org: a fully searchable, curated catalog of human and machine-readable definitions, each linked to the corresponding neuron and property terms. Furthermore, we extend our robust approach to providing each neuron type with an informative name and unique identifier by mapping all encountered synonyms and homonyms.",30
Topological characterization of neuronal arbor morphology via sequence representation: II-global alignment,"Todd A Gillette, Parsa Hosseini, Giorgio A Ascoli",2015/12,Journal BMC bioinformatics,"The increasing abundance of neuromorphological data provides both the opportunity and the challenge to compare massive numbers of neurons from a wide diversity of sources efficiently and effectively. We implemented a modified global alignment algorithm representing axonal and dendritic bifurcations as strings of characters. Sequence alignment quantifies neuronal similarity by identifying branch-level correspondences between trees. The space generated from pairwise similarities is capable of classifying neuronal arbor types as well as, or better than, traditional topological metrics. Unsupervised cluster analysis produces groups that significantly correspond with known cell classes for axons, dendrites, and pyramidal apical dendrites. Furthermore, the distinguishing consensus topology generated by multiple sequence alignment of a group of neurons reveals their shared branching blueprint. Interestingly, the axons of dendritic-targeting interneurons in the rodent cortex associates with pyramidal axons but apart from the (more topologically symmetric) axons of perisomatic-targeting interneurons. Global pairwise and multiple sequence alignment of neurite topologies enables detailed comparison of neurites and identification of conserved topological features in alignment-defined clusters. The methods presented also provide a framework for incorporation of additional branch-level morphological features. Moreover, comparison of multiple alignment with motif analysis shows that the two techniques provide complementary information respectively revealing global and local features.",29
"Augmenting weak semantic cognitive maps with an"" abstractness"" dimension","Alexei V Samsonovich, Giorgio A Ascoli",2013/1/1,Journal Computational intelligence and neuroscience,"The emergent consensus on dimensional models of sentiment, appraisal, emotions, and values is on the semantics of the principal dimensions, typically interpreted as valence, arousal, and dominance. The notion of weak semantic maps was introduced recently as distribution of representations in abstract spaces that are not derived from human judgments, psychometrics, or any other a priori information about their semantics. Instead, they are defined entirely by binary semantic relations among representations, such as synonymy and antonymy. An interesting question concerns the ability of the antonymy-based semantic maps to capture all ""universal"" semantic dimensions. The present work shows that those narrow weak semantic maps are not complete in this sense and can be augmented with other semantic relations.

Local diameter fully constrains dendritic size in basal but not apical trees of CA1 pyramidal neurons,"Duncan E Donohue, Giorgio A Ascoli",2005/10/1,Journal Journal of Computational Neuroscience,"Computational modeling of dendritic morphology is a powerful tool for quantitatively describing complex geometrical relationships, uncovering principles of dendritic development, and synthesizing virtual neurons to systematically investigate cellular biophysics and network dynamics. A feature common to many morphological models is a dependence of the branching probability on local diameter. Previous models of this type have been able to recreate a wide variety of dendritic morphologies. However, these diameter-dependent models have so far failed to properly constrain branching when applied to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, leading to explosive growth. Here we present a simple modification of this basic approach, in which all parameter sampling, not just bifurcation probability, depends on branch diameter. This added constraint prevents explosive growth in both apical and basal trees of simulated CA1 neurons, yielding arborizations with average numbers and patterns of bifurcations extremely close to those observed in real cells. However, simulated apical trees are much more varied in size than the corresponding real dendrites. We show that, in this model, the excessive variability of simulated trees is a direct consequence of the natural variability of diameter changes at and between bifurcations observed in apical, but not basal, dendrites. Conversely, some aspects of branch distribution were better matched by virtual apical trees than by virtual basal trees. Dendritic morphometrics related to spatial position, such as path distance from the soma or branch order, may be necessary to fully constrain CA1 apical tree size and basal …",27

We are entering a new era in which classical anatomical criteria are only the beginning toward defining the identity of a neuron as carried in its name. New criteria include patterns of gene expression, membrane properties of channels and receptors, pharmacology of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, physiological properties of impulse firing, and state-dependent variations in expression of characteristic genes and proteins. These gene and functional properties are increasingly defining neuron types and subtypes. Clarity will therefore be enhanced by conveying as much as possible the genes and properties in the neuron name. Using a tested format of parent-child relations for the region and subregion for naming a neuron, we show how the format can be extended so that these additional properties can become an explicit part of a neuron’s identity and name, or archived in a linked properties database. Based on the mouse, examples are provided for neurons in several brain regions as proof of principle, with extension to the complexities of neuron names in the cerebral cortex.

"Trees of the brain, roots of the mind",Giorgio A Ascoli,2015/4/24,Publisher MIT Press,"An examination of the stunning beauty of the brain's cellular form, with many color illustrations, and a provocative claim about the mind-brain relationship. The human brain is often described as the most complex object in the universe. Tens of billions of nerve cells-tiny tree-like structures—make up a massive network with enormous computational power. In this book, Giorgio Ascoli reveals another aspect of the human brain: the stunning beauty of its cellular form. Doing so, he makes a provocative claim about the mind-brain relationship. If each nerve cell enlarged a thousandfold looks like a tree, then a small region of the nervous system at the same magnified scale resembles a gigantic, fantastic forest. This structural majesty—illustrated throughout the book with extraordinary color images—hides the secrets behind the genesis of our mental states. Ascoli proposes that some of the most intriguing mysteries of the mind can be solved using the basic architectural principles of the brain. After an overview of the scientific and philosophical foundations of his argument, Ascoli links mental states with patterns of electrical activity in nerve cells, presents an emerging minority opinion of how the brain learns from experience, and unveils a radically new hypothesis of the mechanism determining what is learned, what isn't, and why.

Algorithmic reconstruction of complete axonal arborizations in rat hippocampal neurons,"Ruggero Scorcioni, Giorgio A Ascoli",2005/6/1,Journal Neurocomputing,"Three-dimensional axonal morphologies are not currently available to the neuroscience community in a format suitable for computational modeling. We have designed an algorithm to reconstruct full axonal arborizations based on sets of digitized segments extracted from raw anatomical preparations. We applied this algorithm to eight rat neurons covering the entire synaptic loop of the hippocampal formation (entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1, and subiculum). Since no digital reconstructions of axons have been previously completed for these cell classes, we validated the algorithm by comparing the resulting dendritic arborizations (which were automatically reconstructed along the axons) of the CA1 cells with those available in several public archives. The eight axonal morphologies are quantitatively analyzed and freely distributed in SWC format (http://www.krasnow.gmu.edu/L-Neuron).",22

Older adults report moderately more detailed autobiographical memories,"Robert S Gardner, Matteo Mainetti, Giorgio A Ascoli",2015/5/19,Journal Frontiers in Psychology,"Autobiographical memory (AM) is an essential component of the human mind. Although the([A-z]+) amount and types of subjective detail (content) that compose AMs constitute important dimensions of recall, age-related changes in memory content are not well characterized. Previously, we introduced the Cue-Recalled Autobiographical Memory test (CRAM; see http://cramtest.info), an instrument that collects subjective reports of AM content, and applied it to college-aged subjects. CRAM elicits AMs using naturalistic word-cues. Subsequently, subjects date each cued AM to a life period and count the number of remembered details from specified categories (features), e.g., temporal detail, spatial detail, persons, objects, and emotions. The current work applies CRAM to a broad range of individuals (18–78 years old) to quantify the effects of age on AM content. Subject age showed a moderately positive effect on AM content: older compared with younger adults reported ∼16% more details (∼25 vs. ∼21 in typical AMs). This age-related increase in memory content was similarly observed for remote and recent AMs, although content declined with the age of the event among all subjects. In general, the distribution of details across features was largely consistent among younger and older adults. However, certain types of details, i.e., those related to objects and sequences of events, contributed more to the age effect on content. Altogether, this work identifies a moderate age-related feature-specific alteration in the way life events are subjectively recalled, among an otherwise stable retrieval profile.",21
Quantitative measurements of autobiographical memory content,"Robert S Gardner, Adam T Vogel, Matteo Mainetti, Giorgio A Ascoli",2012/9/21,Volume 7,"Autobiographical memory (AM), subjective recollection of past experiences, is fundamental in everyday life. Nevertheless, characterization of the spontaneous occurrence of AM, as well as of the number and types of recollected details, remains limited. The CRAM (Cue-Recalled Autobiographical Memory) test (http://cramtest.info) adapts and combines the cue-word method with an assessment that collects counts of details recalled from different life periods. The SPAM (Spontaneous Probability of Autobiographical Memories) protocol samples introspection during everyday activity, recording memory duration and frequency. These measures provide detailed, naturalistic accounts of AM content and frequency, quantifying essential dimensions of recollection. AM content (∼20 details/recollection) decreased with the age of the episode, but less drastically than the probability of reporting remote compared to recent memories. AM retrieval was frequent (∼20/hour), each memory lasting ∼30 seconds. Testable hypotheses of the specific content retrieved in a fixed time from given life periods are presented.",21

At potentials near or below the resting potential integration of synaptic signals is most affected by the passive properties of the cell and hyperpolarization-activated currents (Ih). Here we focused specifically on a subset of neurons within the CA3b subregion of the rat hippocampus in order to better understand their membrane response within subthreshold voltage ranges. Using a combined experimental and computational approach we found that the passive properties of these neurons varied up to fivefold between cells. Likewise, there was a large variance in the expression of Ih channels. However, the contribution of Ih was minimal at resting potentials endowing the membrane with an apparent linear response to somatic current injection within ±10 mV. Unlike in …",21

Models of 16 pyramidal cells with uniform channel distribution were constructed from neuroanatomical data. Somatic injection of current produced distinct and different firing modes: spiking, bursting, and plateauing. Results show that the change in diameter as a function of the branch distance and path length from the soma is an indicator of firing behavior. Spike rate significantly correlated with dendritic length, surface area, bifurcations, terminations, and branch order. We conclude that dendritic morphology can significantly influence the qualitative and quantitative electrophysiological behavior of neurons.",20

Experimentally recorded spike trains from various neurons show qualitatively distinguishable features such as delayed spiking, spiking with or without frequency adaptation, and intrinsic bursting. Moreover, the input-dependent responses of a neuron not only show different quantitative features, such as higher spike frequency for a stronger input current injection, but can also exhibit qualitatively different responses, such as spiking and bursting under different input conditions, thus forming a complex phenotype of responses. In previous work, the comprehensive knowledge base of hippocampal neuron types Hippocampome.org systematically characterized various spike pattern phenotypes experimentally identified from 120 neuron types/subtypes. In this paper, we present a complete set of simple phenomenological models that quantitatively reproduce the diverse and complex phenotypes of hippocampal neurons. In addition to point-neuron models, we created compact multi-compartment models with up to four compartments, which will allow spatial segregation of synaptic integration in network simulations. Electrotonic compartmentalization observed in our compact multi-compartment models is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations.

We then use local and global rule-based stochastic simulations to generate artificial arbors, and identify the parameters that statistically best approximate the real data. We observe structural homeostasis in all da classes, where an increase in size of one dendritic stem is compensated by a reduction in the other stems of the same neuron. Local rule models show that bifurcation probability is determined by branch order, while branch length depends on path distance from the soma.

Large-scale spiking network models of entire brain regions offer a platform to test theories of neural computation and cognitive function, providing useful insights on information processing in the nervous system. However, a systematic in-depth investigation requires network simulations to capture the biological intrinsic diversity of individual neurons at a sufficient level of accuracy.

Communication structure of cortical networks,"Luciano da Fontoura Costa, João Luiz B Batista, Giorgio A Ascoli",2011/3/4,Journal Frontiers in computational neuroscience,"Large-scale cortical networks exhibit characteristic topological properties that shape communication between brain regions and global cortical dynamics. Analysis of complex networks allows the description of connectedness, distance, clustering, and centrality that reveal different aspects of how the network's nodes communicate. Here, we focus on a novel analysis of complex walks in a series of mammalian cortical networks that model potential dynamics of information flow between individual brain regions. We introduce two new measures called absorption and driftness. Absorption is the average length of random walks between any two nodes, and takes into account all paths that may diffuse activity throughout the network. Driftness is the ratio between absorption and the corresponding shortest path length. For a given node of the network, we also define four related measurements, namely in- and out-absorption as well as in- and out-driftness, as the averages of the corresponding measures from all nodes to that node, and from that node to all nodes, respectively. We find that the cat thalamo-cortical system incorporates features of two classic network topologies, Erdös–Rényi graphs with respect to in-absorption and in-driftness, and configuration models with respect to out-absorption and out-driftness. Moreover, taken together these four measures separate the network nodes based on broad functional roles (visual, auditory, somatomotor, and frontolimbic).",13

The dependence of input-output linearity on synchrony was sigmoidal and considerably robust with respect to dendritic location, stimulus irregularity, and alteration of active and synaptic properties. Moreover, synchrony affected firing rate differently at lower and higher input frequencies. A reduced integrate-and-fire model suggested a mechanism explaining …",13

An update to Hippocampome. org by integrating single-cell phenotypes with circuit function in vivo,"Alberto Sanchez-Aguilera, Diek W Wheeler, Teresa Jurado-Parras, Manuel Valero, Miriam S Nokia, Elena Cid, Ivan Fernandez-Lamo, Nate Sutton, Daniel García-Rincón, M Liset, Giorgio A Ascoli",2021/5/6,Journal PLoS Biology,"Understanding brain operation demands linking basic behavioral traits to cell-type specific dynamics of different brain-wide subcircuits. This requires a system to classify the basic operational modes of neurons and circuits. Single-cell phenotyping of firing behavior during ongoing oscillations in vivo has provided a large body of evidence on entorhinal–hippocampal function, but data are dispersed and diverse. Here, we mined literature to search for information regarding the phase-timing dynamics of over 100 hippocampal/entorhinal neuron types defined in Hippocampome.org. We identified missing and unresolved pieces of knowledge (e.g., the preferred theta phase for a specific neuron type) and complemented the dataset with our own new data. By confronting the effect of brain state and recording methods, we highlight the equivalences and differences across conditions and offer a number of novel observations. We show how a heuristic approach based on oscillatory features of morphologically identified neurons can aid in classifying extracellular recordings of single cells and discuss future opportunities and challenges towards integrating single-cell phenotypes with circuit function.",12

Distinct relations of microtubules and actin filaments with dendritic architecture,"Sumit Nanda, Shatabdi Bhattacharjee, Daniel N Cox, Giorgio A Ascoli",2020/12/18,Journal Iscience,"Microtubules (MTs) and F-actin (F-act) have long been recognized as key regulators of dendritic morphology. Nevertheless, precisely ascertaining their distinct influences on dendritic trees have been hampered until now by the lack of direct, arbor-wide cytoskeletal quantification. We pair live confocal imaging of fluorescently labeled dendritic arborization (da) neurons in Drosophila larvae with complete multi-signal neural tracing to separately measure MTs and F-act. We demonstrate that dendritic arbor length is highly interrelated with local MT quantity, whereas local F-act enrichment is associated with dendritic branching. Computational simulation of arbor structure solely constrained by experimentally observed subcellular distributions of these cytoskeletal components generated synthetic morphological and molecular patterns statistically equivalent to those of real da neurons, corroborating the efficacy of local MT …",12

An ontology-based search engine for digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology,"Sridevi Polavaram, Giorgio A Ascoli",2017/6,Journal Brain informatics,"Neuronal morphology is extremely diverse across and within animal species, developmental stages, brain regions, and cell types. This diversity is functionally important because neuronal structure strongly affects synaptic integration, spiking dynamics, and network connectivity. Digital reconstructions of axonal and dendritic arbors are thus essential to quantify and model information processing in the nervous system. NeuroMorpho.Org is an established repository containing tens of thousands of digitally reconstructed neurons shared by several hundred laboratories worldwide. Each neuron is annotated with specific metadata based on the published references and additional details provided by data owners. The number of represented metadata concepts has grown over the years in parallel with the increase of available data. Until now, however, the lack of standardized terminologies and of an adequately structured metadata schema limited the effectiveness of user searches. Here we present a new organization of NeuroMorpho.Org metadata grounded on a set of interconnected hierarchies focusing on the main dimensions of animal species, anatomical regions, and cell types. We have comprehensively mapped each metadata term in NeuroMorpho.Org to this formal ontology, explicitly resolving all ambiguities caused by synonymy and homonymy. Leveraging this consistent framework, we introduce OntoSearch, a powerful functionality that seamlessly enables retrieval of morphological data based on expert knowledge and logical inferences through an intuitive string-based user interface with auto-complete capability. In addition to returning the …",12
Differential Arc expression in the hippocampus and striatum during the transition from attentive to automatic navigation on a plus maze,"Robert S Gardner, Daniel F Suarez, Nadira K Robinson-Burton, Christopher J Rudnicky, Asish Gulati, Giorgio A Ascoli, Theodore C Dumas",2016/5/1,Journal Neurobiology of Learning and Memory,"The strategies utilized to effectively perform a given task change with practice and experience. During a spatial navigation task, with relatively little training, performance is typically attentive enabling an individual to locate the position of a goal by relying on spatial landmarks. These (place) strategies require an intact hippocampus. With task repetition, performance becomes automatic; the same goal is reached using a fixed response or sequence of actions. These (response) strategies require an intact striatum. The current work aims to understand the activation patterns across these neural structures during this experience-dependent strategy transition. This was accomplished by region-specific measurement of activity-dependent immediate early gene expression among rats trained to different degrees on a dual-solution task (i.e., a task that can be solved using either place or response navigation).

Using the hippocampus as a working example, we outline a long-term strategy to (i) implement an anatomically and biophysically accurate “bottom-up” model reproducing the known neurobiological activity; (ii) use the model to investigate and implement simple functional properties such as spatial mapping and path-finding; and (iii) insert a higher level “top-down” cognitive capacity to instantiate the concept of agency in the context of a generalized memory indexing theory.

An open-source framework for neuroscience metadata management applied to digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology,"Kayvan Bijari, Masood A Akram, Giorgio A Ascoli",2020/12,Journal Brain Informatics,"Research advancements in neuroscience entail the production of a substantial amount of data requiring interpretation, analysis, and integration. The complexity and diversity of neuroscience data necessitate the development of specialized databases and associated standards and protocols. NeuroMorpho.Org is an online repository of over one hundred thousand digitally reconstructed neurons and glia shared by hundreds of laboratories worldwide. Every entry of this public resource is associated with essential metadata describing animal species, anatomical region, cell type, experimental condition, and additional information relevant to contextualize the morphological content. Until recently, the lack of a user-friendly, structured metadata annotation system relying on standardized terminologies constituted a major hindrance in this effort, limiting the data release pace. Over the past 2 years, we have transitioned the original spreadsheet-based metadata annotation system of NeuroMorpho.Org to a custom-developed, robust, web-based framework for extracting, structuring, and managing neuroscience information. Here we release the metadata portal publicly and explain its functionality to enable usage by data contributors. This framework facilitates metadata annotation, improves terminology management, and accelerates data sharing. Moreover, its open-source development provides the opportunity of adapting and extending the code base to other related research projects with similar requirements.

We introduce PaperBot, a configurable, modular, open-source crawler to automatically find and efficiently index peer-reviewed publications based on periodic full-text searches across publisher web portals. PaperBot may operate stand-alone or it can be easily integrated with other software platforms and knowledge bases. Without user interactions, PaperBot retrieves and stores the bibliographic information (full reference, corresponding email contact, and full-text keyword hits) based on pre-set search logic from a wide range of sources including Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, PubMed/PubMedCentral, Nature, and Google Scholar. Although different publishing sites require different search configurations, the common interface of PaperBot unifies the process from the user perspective. Once saved, all information becomes web accessible allowing efficient triage of articles based on their actual relevance and seamless annotation of suitable metadata content. The platform allows the agile reconfiguration of all key details, such as the selection of search portals, keywords, and metadata dimensions. The tool also provides a one-click option for adding articles manually via digital object identifier or PubMed ID. The microservice architecture of PaperBot implements these capabilities as a loosely coupled collection of distinct modules devised to work separately, as a whole, or to be integrated with or replaced by additional software.

The algorithm relies on two local hidden variables, one of which might be associated with dendritic microtubules, and another may represent the time of development.",11
Relation between neuronal morphology and electrophysiology in the Kainate lesion model of Alzheimer's Disease,"Slawomir J Nasuto, Robert M Knape, Jeffrey L Krichmar, Giorgio A Ascoli",2001/6/1,Journal Neurocomputing,"This paper describes a computational and statistical study of the influence of morphological changes on the electrophysiological response of neurons from an animal model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We combined experimental morphological data from rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells with a well-established model of active membrane properties. Dendritic morphology and the somatic response to simulated current clamp conditions were then compared for cells from the control and the AD group. The computational approach allowed us to single out the influences of neuromorphology on neuronal response by eliminating the effects of active channel variability. The results did not reveal a simple relationship between morphological changes associated with AD and changes in neural response.

A large scale model of the cerebellar cortex (256 neurons, ∼300,000 compartments) is used to simulate a saccadic eye movement task.

A community spring for neuroscience data sharing,Giorgio A Ascoli,2014/10,Source Neuroinformatics,"I consider 2014 up to now a good year for neuroscience data sharing.

BEAN: Interpretable and efficient learning with biologically-enhanced artificial neuronal assembly regularization,"Yuyang Gao, Giorgio A Ascoli, Liang Zhao",2021/6/1,Journal Frontiers in Neurorobotics,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known for extracting useful information from large amounts of data. However, the representations learned in DNNs are typically hard to interpret, especially in dense layers. One crucial issue of the classical DNN model such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) is that neurons in the same layer of DNNs are conditionally independent of each other, which makes co-training and emergence of higher modularity difficult. In contrast to DNNs, biological neurons in mammalian brains display substantial dependency patterns. Specifically, biological neural networks encode representations by so-called neuronal assemblies: groups of neurons interconnected by strong synaptic interactions and sharing joint semantic content. The resulting population coding is essential for human cognitive and mnemonic processes. Here, we propose a novel Biologically Enhanced Artificial Neuronal assembly (BEAN) regularization to model neuronal correlations and dependencies, inspired by cell assembly theory from neuroscience. Experimental results show that BEAN enables the formation of interpretable neuronal functional clusters and consequently promotes a sparse, memory/computation-efficient network without loss of model performance. Moreover, our few-shot learning experiments demonstrate that BEAN could also enhance the generalizability of the model when training samples are extremely limited.",9
A neuronal blueprint for directional mechanosensation in larval zebrafish,"Gema Valera, Daniil A Markov, Kayvan Bijari, Owen Randlett, Amir Asgharsharghi, Jean-Pierre Baudoin, Giorgio A Ascoli, Ruben Portugues, Hernán López-Schier",2021/4/12,Journal Current Biology,"Animals have a remarkable ability to use local cues to orient in space in the absence of a panoramic fixed reference frame.

We generated a comprehensive light-microscopy cell-resolution projectome of lateralis afferent neurons (LANs) and used clustering techniques for morphological classification. We find surprising structural constancy among LANs. Laser-mediated microlesions indicate that precise topographic mapping of lateral-line receptors is not essential for rheotaxis. Recording neuronal-activity during controlled mechanical stimulation of neuromasts reveals unequal representation of water-flow direction in the hindbrain.

Distinct and synergistic feedforward inhibition of pyramidal cells by basket and bistratified interneurons,"Michele Ferrante, Giorgio A Ascoli",2015/11/5,Journal Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,"Feedforward inhibition (FFI) enables pyramidal cells in area CA1 of the hippocampus (CA1PCs) to remain easily excitable while faithfully representing a broad range of excitatory inputs without quickly saturating. Despite the cortical ubiquity of FFI, its specific function is not completely understood. FFI in CA1PCs is mediated by two physiologically and morphologically distinct GABAergic interneurons: fast-spiking, perisomatic-targeting basket cells and regular-spiking, dendritic-targeting bistratified cells. These two FFI pathways might create layer-specific computational sub-domains within the same CA1PC, but teasing apart their specific contributions remains experimentally challenging. We implemented a biophysically realistic model of CA1PCs using 40 digitally reconstructed morphologies and constraining synaptic numbers, locations, amplitude, and kinetics with available experimental data. First, we validated the model by reproducing the known combined basket and bistratified FFI of CA1PCs at the population level. We then analyzed how the two interneuron types independently affected the CA1PC spike probability and timing as a function of inhibitory strength. Separate FFI by basket and bistratified respectively modulated CA1PC threshold and gain. Concomitant FFI by both interneuron types synergistically extended the dynamic range of CA1PCs by buffering their spiking response to excitatory stimulation. These results suggest testable hypotheses on the precise effects of GABAergic diversity on cortical computation.",9

Self-sustaining non-repetitive activity in a large scale neuronal-level model of the hippocampal circuit,"Ruggero Scorcioni, David J Hamilton, Giorgio A Ascoli",2008/10/1,Journal Neural networks,"The mammalian hippocampus is involved in spatial representation and memory storage and retrieval, and much research is ongoing to elucidate the cellular and system-level mechanisms underlying these cognitive functions. Modeling may be useful to link network-level activity patterns to the relevant features of hippocampal anatomy and electrophysiology.

To this end, we construct a model of the hippocampus with 16 distinct neuronal classes (including both local and projection cells) and 200,000 individual neurons. The number of neurons in each class and their interconnectivity are drawn from rat anatomy.

Bayesian morphometry of hippocampal cells suggests same-cell somatodendritic repulsion,"Giorgio Ascoli, Alexei Samsonovich",2001,Journal Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,"Visual inspection of neurons suggests that dendritic orientation may be determined both by internal constraints (eg membrane tension) and by external vector fields (eg neurotrophic gradients). For example, basal dendrites of pyramidal cells appear nicely fan-out. This regular orientation is hard to justify completely with a general tendency to grow straight, given the zigzags observed experimentally. Instead, dendrites could (A) favor a fixed (“external”) direction, or (B) repel from their own soma. To investigate these possibilities quantitatively, reconstructed hippocampal cells were subjected to Bayesian analysis. The statistical model combined linearly factors A and B, as well as the tendency to grow straight. For all morphological classes, B was found to be significantly positive and consistently greater than A. In addition, when dendrites were artificially re-oriented according to this model, the resulting structures closely resembled real morphologies. These results suggest that somatodendritic repulsion may play a role in determining dendritic orientation. Since hippocampal cells are very densely packed and their dendritic trees highly overlap, the repulsion must be cell-specific. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying such specificity.",9

In this study, we constructed a comprehensive map of all cortico-tectal projections and identified four collicular zones with differential cortical inputs: medial (SC.m), centromedial (SC.cm), centrolateral (SC.cl) and lateral (SC.l). Computational analyses revealed that cortico-tectal projections are organized as multiple subnetworks that are consistent with previously identified cortico-cortical and cortico-striatal subnetworks. Furthermore, we delineated the brain-wide input/output organization of each collicular zone and described a subset of their constituent neuronal cell types based on distinct connectional and morphological features.

"Biomedical research funding: when the game gets tough, winners start to play",Giorgio A Ascoli,2007/9,Source Bioessays,"Extramural funding provides major support for biomedical research in academia, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants often constitute direct evaluation criteria for promotions and tenure. Therefore, NIH budget trends influence long‐term scientific strategies and career decisions, as well as the progress of science itself. Our analysis of the last 37 years of NIH awards, however, reveals that the success rate of grant applications submitted for funding is negatively related to the total yearly amount of (inflation‐adjusted) NIH extramural expenditure. Instead, as might be expected, the ratio between available funding and the number of submission directly predicts the probability of winning support in any given year. We purport that the considerable success rate variability can be parsimoniously explained by a proportional but delayed reaction of the number of applications to budget fluctuations.

These constructs can provide a bridge between single-cell morphology and system-level stereology, as well as between subcellular biophysical properties and emergent network activity.

Coordinate systems for dendritic spines: a somatocentric approach,"Giorgio A Ascoli, Rebecca F Goldin",1997/3,Journal Complexity,"Of fundamental importance in describing a neuron's activity and constructing biologically plausible neural networks is the unambiguous description of its smallest element of input in the integration process. Among neuronal input units are the synaptic spines: highly regulated and coordinated elements on the dendrites, exchanging both electrical signals and molecules with the soma along the dendritic branches. Mapping the physiological parameters of dendritic branches and their spines in anatomically compatible coordinates is important because of the interactions between “close” spines and between spines and the soma. We present a simple method for quantitatively locating dendritic spines by separating their coordinates into two components. The first takes into account the position of the dendritic branch on which the spine lies. In this component, the distance between a branch and the soma is given by the …",8

Universal Dimensions of Meaning Derived from Semantic Relations among Words and Senses: Mereological Completeness vs. Ontological Generality,"Alexei V Samsonovich, Giorgio A Ascoli",2014/7/15,Journal Computation,"A key to semantic analysis is a precise and practically useful definition of meaning that is general for all domains of knowledge. We previously introduced the notion of weak semantic map: a metric space allocating concepts along their most general (universal) semantic characteristics while at the same time ignoring other, domain-specific aspects of their meanings. Here we address questions of the number, quality, and mutual independence of the weak semantic dimensions. Specifically, we employ semantic relationships not previously used for weak semantic mapping, such as holonymy/meronymy (“is-part/member-of”), and we compare maps constructed from word senses to those constructed from words. We show that the “completeness” dimension derived from the holonym/meronym relation is independent of, and practically orthogonal to, the “abstractness” dimension derived from the hypernym-hyponym (“is-a”) relation, while both dimensions are orthogonal to the maps derived from synonymy and antonymy. Interestingly, the choice of using relations among words vs. senses implies a non-trivial trade-off between rich and unambiguous information due to homonymy and polysemy. The practical utility of the new and prior dimensions is illustrated by the automated evaluation of different kinds of documents. Residual analysis of available linguistic resources, such as WordNet, suggests that the number of universal semantic dimensions representable in natural language may be finite. Their complete characterization, as well as the extension of results to non-linguistic materials, remains an open challenge.",7

Identifying the relevant levels of analysis is important to define proper mathematical formalisms for describing the brain and the mind, such that they could be mapped onto each other in order to explain their equivalence. Based on these premises, we overview the potential of neural connectivity to provide highly informative constraints on brain computational process. Moreover, we outline approaches for representing cognitive and emotional states geometrically with semantic maps. Next, we summarize leading theoretical framework that might serve as an explanatory bridge between neural connectivity and mental space. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of this framework for human communication and our view of reality. We conclude by analyzing the practical requirements to manage the necessary data for solving the mind-brain problem from this perspective.",7

The complex link between neuroanatomy and consciousness,Giorgio A Ascoli,2000/9/1,Journal Complexity,"This essay is a commentary on Edelman and Tononi's A Universe of Consciousness ñ How Matter Becomes Imagination, a scientific book on the mind-body relationship. The underlying theme of the book is that consciousness is a process emerging from highly integrated and distributed activity in the thalamocortical system in the brain (the ìdynamic coreî). The authors use this hypothesis to explain several fundamental characteristics of consciousness in terms of an interesting definition of neural complexity. A Universe of Consciousness presents a theory well-grounded in neuroanatomy, and succeeds in connecting neurobiological knowledge with subjective experience. The result is a convincing story that unfolds from an accurate description of the physical and biological processes in the nervous system (the first two thirds of the book) to an intriguing explanation of qualia, the private, qualitative, and subjective aspects of consciousness. After reviewing the book, we comment on specific scientific and philosophical aspects of Edelman and Tononi's approach. Particularly, we discuss whether the implications of the ìdynamic coreî hypothesis involve the establishment of new physical laws or can be reduced to presently accepted scientific theories. In addition, we explore the consequences of establishing the primacy of neuroanatomy in the study of consciousness with a thought experiment on qualia.",7

A neural mechanism for background information-gated learning based on axonal-dendritic overlaps,"Matteo Mainetti, Giorgio A Ascoli",2015/3/13,Journal PLoS computational biology,"Experiencing certain events triggers the acquisition of new memories. Although necessary, however, actual experience is not sufficient for memory formation. One-trial learning is also gated by knowledge of appropriate background information to make sense of the experienced occurrence. Strong neurobiological evidence suggests that long-term memory storage involves formation of new synapses. On the short time scale, this form of structural plasticity requires that the axon of the pre-synaptic neuron be physically proximal to the dendrite of the post-synaptic neuron. We surmise that such “axonal-dendritic overlap” (ADO) constitutes the neural correlate of background information-gated (BIG) learning. The hypothesis is based on a fundamental neuroanatomical constraint: an axon must pass close to the dendrites that are near other neurons it contacts. The topographic organization of the mammalian cortex ensures that nearby neurons encode related information. Using neural network simulations, we demonstrate that ADO is a suitable mechanism for BIG learning. We model knowledge as associations between terms, concepts or indivisible units of thought via directed graphs. The simplest instantiation encodes each concept by single neurons. Results are then generalized to cell assemblies. The proposed mechanism results in learning real associations better than spurious co-occurrences, providing definitive cognitive advantages.",6

Although microtubules and F-actin have long been recognized as key determinants of dendritic morphology, their precise and distinct roles are yet to be fully elucidated. The lack of arbor-wide cytoskeletal information registered with neuromorphological measurements has so far limited direct observations of the interrelations between microtubules, F-actin and arbor architecture. Here we pair live confocal imaging of fluorescently labeled dendritic arborization (da) neurons in the fruit fly larva with our recently developed multi-signal neural tracing technique. We discovered that dendritic arbor length is highly dependent on local microtubule quantity, whereas local F-actin enrichment is associated with dendritic branching. Earlier computer simulations used quantifiable morphological features both as model parameters (e.g. branch thickness) and emergent properties (e.g. tree asymmetry). Multi-signal reconstructions allowed us to computationally simulate arbor structure solely constrained by experimentally measured, local subcellular distributions of microtubules and F-actin. The generative model yielded synthetic trees with morphological and molecular patterns statistically indistinguishable from those of real da neurons, demonstrating that these two investigated cytoskeletal components are sufficient to define dendritic architecture.

The core of the architecture is based on our previously described model of hippocampal function and includes 3 layers (DG, CA3, CA1) of spiking neurons with noisy STDP synaptic connections among neighboring layers. The model is applied to a spatial navigation paradigm in a hierarchical virtual environment, the metrics of which need to be learned by exploration. The goal in each trial is set arbitrarily as any one of the previously seen objects or features. In order to navigate toward the goal, the agent needs to “imagine” previously performed available moves at the current location and select one of them, using the acquired spatial knowledge.

However, since forgetting is inevitable given bounded memory and unbounded task loads, ‘how to reasonably forget’ is a problem continual learning must address in order to reduce the performance gap between AIs and humans, in terms of (1) memory efficiency, (2) generalizability, and (3) robustness when dealing with noisy data. To address this, we propose a novel ScheMAtic memory peRsistence and Transience (SMART)1 framework for continual learning with external memory that builds on recent advances in neuroscience.

A method for estimating the potential synaptic connections between axons and dendrites from 2D neuronal images,"Carolina Tecuatl, Diek W Wheeler, Giorgio A Ascoli",2021/7/5,Journal Bio-protocol,"Computational neuroscience aims to model, reproduce, and predict network dynamics for different neuronal ensembles by distilling knowledge derived from electrophysiological and morphological evidence.

Itinerant complexity in networks of intrinsically bursting neurons,"Siva Venkadesh, Ernest Barreto, Giorgio A Ascoli",2020/6/22,Journal Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science,"Active neurons can be broadly classified by their intrinsic oscillation patterns into two classes characterized by spiking or bursting. Here, we show that networks of identical bursting neurons with inhibitory pulsatory coupling exhibit itinerant dynamics. Using the relative phases of bursts between neurons, we numerically demonstrate that the network exhibits endogenous transitions between multiple modes of transient synchrony. This is true even for bursts consisting of two spikes. In contrast, our simulations reveal that networks of identical singlet-spiking neurons do not exhibit such complexity. These results suggest a role for bursting dynamics in realizing itinerant complexity in neural circuits.",3

Measuring and modeling morphology: how dendrites take shape,"Todd A Gillette, Giorgio A Ascoli",2012,Journal Computational Systems Neurobiology,"Neuronal processes grow under a variety of constraints, both immediate and evolutionary. Their pattern of growth provides insight into their function. This chapter begins by reviewing morphological metrics used in analyses and computational models. Molecular mechanisms underlying growth and plasticity are then discussed, followed by several types of modeling approaches. Computer simulation of morphology can be used to describe and reproduce the statistics of neuronal types or to evaluate growth and functional hypotheses. For instance, models in which branching is probabilistically determined by diameter produce realistic virtual dendrites of most neuronal types, though more complicated statistical models are required for other types. Virtual dendrites grown under environmental and/or functional constraints are also discussed, offering a broad perspective on dendritic morphology.",3

A complete representation of electrotonic dynamics implies the computationally expensive solution of cable differential equations.

Formin3 regulates dendritic architecture via microtubule stabilization and is required for somatosensory nociceptive behavior,"Ravi Das, Jamin M Letcher, Jenna M Harris, Istvan Foldi, Sumit Nanda, Hansley M Bobo, József Mihály, Giorgio A Ascoli, Daniel N Cox",2017/11/30,Journal bioRxiv,"The acquisition, maintenance and modulation of dendritic architecture are critical to neuronal form, plasticity and function. Morphologically, dendritic shape impacts functional connectivity and is largely mediated by organization and dynamics of cytoskeletal fibers that provide the underlying scaffold and tracks for intracellular trafficking. Identifying molecular factors that regulate dendritic cytoskeletal architecture is therefore important in understanding mechanistic links between cytoskeletal organization and neuronal function. In a neurogenomic-driven genetic screen of cytoskeletal regulatory molecules, we identified Formin3 (Form3) as a critical regulator of cytoskeletal architecture in Drosophila nociceptive sensory neurons. Form3 is a member of the conserved Formin family of multi-functional cytoskeletal regulators and time course analyses reveal Form3 is cell-autonomously required for maintenance of complex dendritic arbors. Cytoskeletal imaging demonstrates form3 mutants exhibit a specific destabilization of the dendritic microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton, together with defective dendritic trafficking of mitochondria, satellite Golgi and the TRPA channel Painless. Biochemical studies reveal Form3 directly interacts with MTs via FH1-FH2 domains and promotes MT stabilization via acetylation. Neurologically, mutations in human Inverted Formin 2 (INF2; ortholog of form3) have been causally linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease.

Cytoskeletal analyses reveal requirements for Mts in regulating microtubule stability/polarity and F-actin organization/dynamics. In CIV neurons, mts knockdown leads to reductions in dendritic localization of organelles including mitochondria and satellite Golgi outposts, while CI neurons show increased Golgi outpost trafficking along the dendritic arbor.

Neuroinformatics in the Time of Coronavirus,Giorgio A Ascoli,2020/6,Journal Neuroinformatics,"Some years ago, I received an inquiry from an international PhD student from the lab of a known electrophysiologist. 1 She had secured a fellowship that allowed her to spend time in another lab during her doctoral training and she wanted to come to my lab to learn the neuroinformatics trade. I interviewed her in person at the Society for Neuroscience meeting a few weeks later and asked her why, after investing half a decade mastering advanced skills in patch clamp and intraneuronal recordings, she wanted to jump into neuroinformatics. She was adamant in saying that she saw a shrinking market for experimental research, at least in relative terms, and a growing role for data science. She also thought it would become increasingly difficult, on economic, social, and personnel counts, to eventually create and maintain a wet lab centered on animal research, and to keep it productive.

Pre-stress of actin cortices is important for the viscoelastic response of living cells,"Andrea Cordes, Hannes Witt, Aina Gallemí-Pérez, Bastian Brückner, Florian Grimm, Marian Vache, Tabea Oswald, Daniel Flormann, Franziska Lautenschläger, Marco Tarantola, Andreas Janshoff",2019/9/27,Journal BioRxiv,"Shape, dynamics, and viscoelastic properties of eukaryotic cells are primarily governed by a thin, reversibly cross-linked actomyosin cortex located directly beneath the plasma membrane. We obtain time-dependent rheological responses of fibroblasts and MDCK II cells from deformation-relaxation curves using an atomic force microscope to access the dependence of cortex fluidity on pre-stress. We introduce a viscoelastic model that treats the cell as a composite shell and assumes that relaxation of the cortex follows a power law giving access to cortical pre-stress, area compressibility modulus, and the power law (fluidity) exponent. Cortex fluidity is modulated by interfering with myosin activity. We find that the power law exponent of the cell cortex decreases with increasing intrinsic pre-stress and area compressibility modulus, in accordance with previous finding for isolated actin networks subject to external stress. Extrapolation to zero tension returns the theoretically predicted power law exponent for transiently cross-linked polymer networks. In contrast to the widely used Hertzian mechanics, our model provides viscoelastic parameters independent of indenter geometry and compression velocity.",1
Bean: interpretable representation learning with biologically-enhanced artificial neuronal assembly regularization,"Yuyang Gao, Giorgio A Ascoli, Liang Zhao",2019/9/27,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.13698,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known for extracting useful information from large amounts of data. However, the representations learned in DNNs are typically hard to interpret, especially in dense layers. One crucial issue of the classical DNN model such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) is that neurons in the same layer of DNNs are conditionally independent of each other, which makes co-training and emergence of higher modularity difficult. In contrast to DNNs, biological neurons in mammalian brains display substantial dependency patterns. Specifically, biological neural networks encode representations by so-called neuronal assemblies: groups of neurons interconnected by strong synaptic interactions and sharing joint semantic content. The resulting population coding is essential for human cognitive and mnemonic processes. Here, we propose a novel Biologically Enhanced Artificial Neuronal assembly (BEAN) regularization to model neuronal correlations and dependencies, inspired by cell assembly theory from neuroscience. Experimental results show that BEAN enables the formation of interpretable neuronal functional clusters and consequently promotes a sparse, memory/computation-efficient network without loss of model performance. Moreover, our few-shot learning experiments demonstrate that BEAN could also enhance the generalizability of the model when training samples are extremely limited.",1
Genetic Single Neuron Anatomy reveals fine granularity of cortical interneuron subtypes,"Xiaojun Wang, Jason Tucciarone, Siqi Jiang, Fangfang Yin, Bor-shuen Wang, Dingkang Wang, Yao Jia, Xueyan Jia, Yuxin Li, Tao Yang, Zhengchao Xu, Masood A Akram, Yusu Wang, Shaoqun Zeng, Giorgio A Ascoli, Partha Mitra, Hui Gong, Qingming Luo, Z Josh Huang",2017/11/14,Journal bioRxiv,"Parsing diverse nerve cells into biological types is necessary for understanding neural circuit organization. Morphology is an intuitive criterion for neuronal classification and a proxy of connectivity, but morphological diversity and variability often preclude resolving the granularity of discrete cell groups from population continuum. Combining genetic labeling with high-resolution, large volume light microscopy, we established a platform of genetic single neuron anatomy that resolves, registers and quantifies complete neuron morphologies in the mouse brain. We discovered that cortical axo-axonic cells (AACs), a cardinal GABAergic interneuron type that controls pyramidal neuron (PyN) spiking at axon initial segment, consist of multiple subtypes distinguished by laminar position, dendritic and axonal arborization patterns. Whereas the laminar arrangements of AAC dendrites reflect differential recruitment by input streams, the laminar distribution and local geometry of AAC axons enable differential innervation of PyN ensembles. Therefore, interneuron types likely consist of fine-grained subtypes with distinct input-output connectivity patterns.",1

The critical context for this question was the sprawling growth of the BNeuroX^ vocabulary: not just neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurochemistry, neurocomputing, and neuroimaging, but also neuroethics, neuroevolution, neuroeconomics, neuropolicy, and neuroaesthetics. Among the most controversial ideas that were floated, it was predicted that, if fully successful, neuroinformatics would disappear as a subfield of neuroscience because all of neuroscience would become neuroinformatics.

Such descriptions are usually expressed in natural language, optimizing intuitive understanding and human communication. For computational consumption, this knowledge must be expressed into machine-readable form. The conversion should be sufficiently flexible to enable wide applicability, balancing rigorous logic, algorithm efficiency, and accessibility to neuroscience experts.

The main feature of our architecture is the notion of self aware cognition that we believe is necessary for human-like cognitive growth. Our approach is inspired by studies of the human brain-mind in particular, by theoretical models of representations of agency in the higher associative human brain areas. This feature a theory of mind including representations of ones self allows the system to maintain human-like attention, focus on the most relevant features and aspects of a situation, and come up with ideas and initiatives that may not follow from formal logic.

Cell morphologies in the nervous system: Glia steal the limelight,Giorgio A Ascoli,2023/2,Source Journal of Comparative Neurology,"Neurons and glia have distinct yet interactive functions but are both characterized by branching morphology.

Recently, long‐range axons also are being reconstructed throughout the brain of many organisms from invertebrates to primates. In contrast, less attention has been paid until lately to glial morphology. Thus, although glia and neurons are similarly abundant in the nervous systems of humans and most animal models, glia have traditionally been much less represented than neurons in morphological reconstruction repositories such as NeuroMorpho.Org.

Combinatorial quantification of distinct neural projections from retrograde tracing,"Siva Venkadesh, Anthony Santarelli, Tyler Boesen, Hong-Wei Dong, Giorgio Ascoli",2023/1/9,"Description Comprehensive quantification of neuronal architectures underlying anatomical brain connectivity remains challenging. We introduce a method to identify the distinct axonal projection patterns from a 15 source to a set of target regions and the count of neurons with each pattern. For a source region projecting to 𝑛 targets, there are 2 𝑛− 1 theoretically possible projection types, although only a subset of these types typically exists. By injecting uniquely labeled retrograde tracers in 𝑘 regions (𝑘< 𝑛), one can experimentally count the cells expressing different combinations of colors in the source region1, 2. Such an experiment can be performed for 𝑛 choose 𝑘 combinations. The counts of cells with different 20 color combinations from all experiments provide constraints for a system of equations that include 2 𝑛−1 unknown variables, each corresponding to the count of neurons for a projection pattern. Evolutionary algorithms prove to be effective at solving the resultant system of equations, thus allowing the determination of the counts of neurons with each of the possible projection patterns. Numerical analysis of simulated 4 choose 3 retrograde injection experiments using surrogate data demonstrates 25 reliable and precise count estimates for all projection neuron types. We illustrate the experimental application of this framework by quantifying the projections of mouse primary motor cortex to four prominent targets: the primary and secondary somatosensory and motor cortices.","Comprehensive quantification of neuronal architectures underlying anatomical brain connectivity remains challenging.

Local microtubule and F-actin distributions fully determine the spatial geometry of Drosophila sensory dendritic arbors,"Sumit Nanda, Shatabdi Bhattacharjee, Daniel N Cox, Giorgio A Ascoli",2023,Journal bioRxiv,"Dendritic morphology underlies the source and processing of neuronal signal inputs. Morphology can be broadly described by two types of geometric characteristics. The first is dendrogram topology, defined by the length and frequency of the arbor branches; the second is spatial embedding, mainly determined by branch angles and tortuosity. We have previously demonstrated that microtubules and actin filaments are associated with arbor elongation and branching, fully constraining dendrogram topology. Here we relate the local distribution of these two primary cytoskeletal components with dendritic spatial embedding. We first reconstruct and analyze 167 sensory neurons from the Drosophila larva encompassing multiple cell classes and genotypes. We observe that branches with higher microtubule concentration are overall straighter and tend to deviate less from the direction of their parent branch. F-actin displays a similar effect on the angular deviation from the parent branch direction, but its influence on branch tortuosity varies by class and genotype. We then create a computational model of dendritic morphology purely constrained by the cytoskeletal composition imaged from real neurons. The model quantitatively captures both spatial embedding and dendrogram topology across all tested neuron groups. These results suggest a common developmental mechanism regulating diverse morphologies, where the local cytoskeletal distribution can fully specify the overall emergent geometry of dendritic arbors.",
Automatic identification of scientific publications describing digital reconstructions of neural morphology,"Patricia Maraver, Carolina Tecuatl, Giorgio A Ascoli",2023,Journal bioRxiv,"Motivation: The increasing number of peer-reviewed publications constitutes a challenge for biocuration. For example, NeuroMorpho.Org, a sharing platform for digital reconstructions of neural morphology, must evaluate more than 6000 potentially relevant articles per year to identify data of interest. Here, we describe a tool that uses natural language processing and deep learning to assess the likelihood of a publication to be relevant for the project. Results: The tool automatically identifies articles describing digitally reconstructed neural morphologies with high accuracy. Its processing rate of 900 publications per hour is not only amply sufficient to autonomously track new research, but also allowed the successful evaluation of older publications backlogged due to limited human resources. The number of bio-entities found since launching the tool almost doubled while greatly reducing manual labor.

The Zinc-BED transcription factor Bedwarfed promotes proportional dendritic growth and branching through transcriptional and translational regulation in Drosophila,"Shatabdi Bhattacharjee, Eswar Prasad R Iyer, Srividya Chandramouli Iyer, Sumit Nanda, Myurajan Rubaharan, Giorgio A Ascoli, Daniel N Cox",2023,Journal bioRxiv,"Dendrites are the primary points of sensory or synaptic inputs to a neuron and play an essential role in synaptic integration and neural function. Despite the functional importance of dendrites, relatively less is known about the underlying mechanisms regulating cell-type specific dendritic patterning. Herein, we have dissected functional roles of a previously uncharacterized gene, CG3995, in cell-type specific dendritic development in Drosophila melanogaster. CG3995, which we have named bedwarfed (bdwf), encodes a zinc-finger BED-type protein which is required for proportional growth and branching of dendritic arbors, exhibits nucleocytoplasmic expression, and functions in both transcriptional and translational cellular pathways. At the transcriptional level, we demonstrate a reciprocal regulatory relationship between Bdwf and the homeodomain transcription factor (TF) Cut. We show that Cut positively regulates Bdwf expression and that Bdwf acts as a downstream effector of Cut-mediated dendritic development, whereas overexpression of Bdwf negatively regulates Cut expression in multidendritic sensory neurons. Proteomic analyses revealed that Bdwf interacts with ribosomal proteins and disruption of these proteins produced phenotypically similar dendritic hypotrophy defects as observed in bdwf mutant neurons. We further demonstrate that Bdwf and its ribosomal protein interactors are required for normal microtubule and F-actin cytoskeletal architecture. Finally, our findings reveal that Bdwf is required to promote protein translation and ribosome trafficking along the dendritic arbor. Taken together, these results provide new insights into …",

PP2A phosphatase regulates cell-type specific cytoskeletal organization to drive dendritic diversification,"Shatabdi Bhattacharjee, Erin N Lottes, Sumit Nanda, Andre Golshir, Atit A Patel, Giorgio A Ascoli, Daniel N Cox",2022/3/8,Journal bioRxiv,"Uncovering molecular mechanisms regulating dendritic diversification is essential to understanding the formation and modulation of functional neural circuitry. Transcription factors play critical roles in promoting dendritic diversity and here, we identify PP2A phosphatase function as a downstream effector of Cut-mediated transcriptional regulation of dendrite development. Mutant analyses of the PP2A catalytic subunit (mts) or the scaffolding subunit (PP2A-29B) reveal cell-type specific regulatory effects with the PP2A complex required to promote dendritic growth and branching in Drosophila Class IV (CIV) multidendritic (md) neurons, whereas in Class I (CI) md neurons, PP2A functions in restricting dendritic arborization. Cytoskeletal analyses reveal requirements for Mts in regulating microtubule stability/polarity and F-actin organization/dynamics. In CIV neurons, mts knockdown leads to reductions in dendritic localization of organelles including mitochondria and satellite Golgi outposts, while CI neurons show increased Golgi outpost trafficking along the dendritic arbor. Further, mts mutant neurons exhibit defects in neuronal polarity/compartmentalization. Finally, genetic interaction analyses suggest β-tubulin subunit 85D is a common PP2A target in CI and CIV neurons, while FoxO is a putative target in CI neurons.",

First, we reconstructed> 2,600 synaptic traces from~ 1,200 publications into a uni ed model of synaptic dynamics. We then trained a deep learning architecture with the resulting parameters, each annotated with detailed metadata. The model learned to predict the synaptic properties of all 3,120 circuit connections in arbitrary conditions with accuracy approaching the intrinsic experimental variability. Analysis of normalized data revealed that synaptic signals are controlled by few latent variables associated with speci c molecular markers and interrelating conductance, kinetics, and short-term plasticity. We freely release the tools and full dataset of unitary synaptic values in 32 covariate settings via Hippocampome. org.",

An intelligence element is selected from a set of intelligence elements which change group attack probability estimates and processed via multiple operations. A semantic memory component learns group probability distributions and rules based on the group probability distributions. The rules determine which intelligence element related to the groups to select. Given an environment of new probability distributions, the semantic memory component recalls which rule to select to receive a particular intelligence element. An episodic memory component recalls a utility value for each information element A procedural memory component recalls and selects the information element considered to have the highest utility. A list of intelligence elements is published to disambiguate likely attackers.",

Why have cognitive architectures equivalent to those instantiated by mammalian brains not been implemented in computers already? Is it just because we have not yet found the right ‘boxes’ to model in our data flow diagrams? Or is there a mysterious reason requiring the underlying hardware to be biologically-based? We surmise that the answer might lie in between: certain essential biological aspects of nervous systems, not (yet) routinely implemented in computational models of cognition, might prove to be necessary functional components. One such aspect is the tree-like structure of neuronal dendrites and axons, the branching inputs and outputs of nerve cells.

A web-based version of CRAM can be now accessed online at http://cramtest. info.“Spontaneous Probability of Autobiographical Memories”(SPAM) utilizes an automated paging system to estimate the probability of experiencing an AM within a given time period.

Second, we extended SPAM to estimate the probability of spontaneously experiencing a prospective memory (PM) or an AM within the same time period. Prospective memory is defined as remembering to remember, or remembering an intention to act within a specific window of time in the personal future. CRAM cues AMs with a compilation of words randomly sampled based on natural language usage frequency. Subjects then date every retrieved episode as having occurred in one of 10 temporal bins (each corresponding to 10% of the subject’s present age).

Successful grant fishing in funding droughts,Giorgio A Ascoli,2007/8,Journal nature cell biology,"For several decades, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) played a crucial role in providing the resources to support biomedical research within the United States and further afield1. Although the NIH budget doubled from 1999 to 2003, it has steadily decreased since then in real-dollar terms, prompting widespread concern in the scientific community2. In the past, the NIH budget has routinely suffered from times of decreased funding, and also profited from periods of increased funding. Principal investigators, in turn, respond to these cycles by adjusting their efforts to obtain support for their work. Securing NIH grants entails considerable effort to write an application with the hope of getting it funded. Thus, the ‘success rate’, that is the proportion of the number of grant proposals that are funded among those submitted, is an extremely important factor3.

Some well-known, profoundly-motivated variations on Maxwell’s equations have included the Born-Infeld theory (a nonlinear but Lorentz-covariant modification, that introduces an effective upper bound to the electric field strength), and the Yang-Mills equations (introducing non-Abelian gauge potentials) [2, 3]. These ideas go back many decades, and have deeply influenced the development of theoretical physics. Indeed, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in non-Abelian Born-Infeld Lagrangians [4], which turn out to have important application in string theory and related subjects [5, 6, 7, 8].

The Qualitative Reasoning Neuron: a New Approach to Modeling in Computational Neuroscience,"Jeffrey L Krichmar, Giorgio A Ascoli, James L Olds, Lawrence Hunter",1998,"Journal Computational Neuroscience: Trends in Research, 1998","Modeling in computational neuroscience generally falls into one of two categories. In one approach, differential equations describing the state of a neuron are developed by studying the electrical properties of a neuron under laboratory conditions. The equations are then used to model the behavior of a neuron in an idealized situation1,2. Mathematical models tend to be computationally expensive and difficult to scale up to large neural networks. An alternative approach is artificial neural networks (ANN). ANNs sacrifice features of real brain networks, such as, synaptic transmission, temporal properties and architecture for the ability to build large assemblies of neuronal elements3.",
Cognitive Map Dimensions of the Human Value System Extracted from Natural,"Alexei V Samsonovich, Giorgio A Ascoli",2007,"Journal Advances in artificial general intelligence: Concepts, architectures and algorithms","The notion of a human value system can be quantified as a cognitive map, the dimensions of which capture the semantics of concepts and the associated values. This can be done, if one knows (i) how to define the dimensions of the map, and (ii) how to allocate concepts in those dimensions. Regarding the first question, experimental studies with linguistic material using psychometrics have revealed that valence, arousal and dominance are primary dimensions characterizing human values. The same or similar dimensions are used in popular models of emotions and affects. In these studies, the choice of principal dimensions, as well as scoring concepts, was based on subjective reports or psycho-physiological measurements. Can a cognitive map of human values be constructed without testing human subjects? Here we show that the answer is positive, using generally available dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms. By applying a simple statistical-mechanic model to English and French dictionaries, we constructed multidimensional cognitive maps that capture the semantics of words. We calculated the principal dimensions of the resultant maps and found their semantics consistent across two languages as well as with previously known main cognitive dimensions. These results suggest that the linguistically derived cognitive map of the human value system is language-invariant and, being closely related to psychometrically derived maps, is likely to reflect fundamental aspects of the human mind.",35

This article describes a possible taxonomical solution, focusing on GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex. We developed a novel, web-based interactive system allowing experts to classify neurons with pre-determined criteria. Using Bayesian analysis and clustering algorithms on the resulting data, we investigated the suitability of several anatomical terms and neuron names. Moreover, we show that supervised classification models could automatically categorize interneurons in agreement with experts’ assignments. These results demonstrate a practical and objective approach to advance neuron naming, characterization, and classification based on community consensus.","Scholar articles New Insights in the Classification and Nomenclature of Cortical GABAergic InterneuronsJ DeFelipe, PL López-Cruz, R Benavides-Piccione…Related articles ","Systematic classification and accepted nomenclature of neuron types are still lacking and much needed.

Characterizing the brain arterial hemodynamics with subject-specific MRA-based computational fluid dynamics models,"Fernando Mut, Susan Wright, Giorgio Ascoli, Juan R Cebral","The mechanisms responsible for the initiation and progression of cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke and aneurysms are not completely understood [1]. Previous studies have identified the hemodynamics, wall biomechanics, wall mechano-biology, and peri-vascular environment as key factors. Although their relative importance and interactions are poorly understood, hemodynamics is thought to play an important role. Thus, it is important to characterize the healthy hemodynamic conditions and establish baseline values for the most relevant arterial blood flow variables in order to compare them to pathological conditions. This paper describes a methodology for constructing subject-specific image-based computational models of the brain arterial system from magnetic resonance data and its application to the characterization of the brain arterial hemodynamics.","Scholar articles Characterizing the brain arterial hemodynamics with subject-specific MRA-based computational fluid dynamics modelsF Mut, S Wright, G Ascoli, JR CebralRelated articles All 3 versions ","The mechanisms responsible for the initiation and progression of cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke and aneurysms are not completely understood [1].

Visual Data Mining of Brain Cells,"J urgen Symanzik, Giorgio A Ascoli, Stuart S Washington, Jeffrey L Krichmar","Little is known about the influence of morphological variablity on the physiological response of brain cells. It is assumed that variables such as the number of branching points in the cell tree like structure, its area and the change in shape from soma to terminals may influence the neuron behavior differently under different electric stimulation.In laboratory experiments, it is difficult to separate the electrophysiological effects of biochemical differences ie, channel types and their distributions from those of the morphological differences in a neuron's behavior. Therefore, we have used computer simulations of 3D neuroanatomical data of hippocampal cells while keeping the electrophysiological model constant across different neurons. This allowed us to look specifically at the morphological influence on the neuronal function. We have obtained neuroanatomical data particularly, hippocampal pyramidal cells from public electronic archives. Because of the amount of painstaking work to reconstruct the three dimemsional structure of a neuron, these archives tend to be very small ranging from 3 to 50 cells. Additionally, there is the possibility that different archives have significant morphological differences due to the reconstruction technique. Therefore, it is difficult to reach robust conclusions on the relationship between morphological parameters and electrophysiological output.","Scholar articles Visual Data Mining of Brain CellsJ urgen Symanzik, GA Ascoli, SS Washington…Related articles All 5 versions ","Little is known about the influence of morphological variablity on the physiological response of brain cells.
