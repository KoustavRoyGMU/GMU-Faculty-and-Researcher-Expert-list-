A robust comparison of the KDDCup99 and NSL-KDD IoT network intrusion detection datasets through various machine learning algorithms,"Suchet Sapre, Pouyan Ahmadi, Khondkar Islam",2019/12/31,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.13204,"In recent years, as intrusion attacks on IoT networks have grown exponentially, there is an immediate need for sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs). A vast majority of current IDSs are data-driven, which means that one of the most important aspects of this area of research is the quality of the data acquired from IoT network traffic. Two of the most cited intrusion detection datasets are the KDDCup99 and the NSL-KDD. The main goal of our project was to conduct a robust comparison of both datasets by evaluating the performance of various Machine Learning (ML) classifiers trained on them with a larger set of classification metrics than previous researchers. From our research, we were able to conclude that the NSL-KDD dataset is of a higher quality than the KDDCup99 dataset as the classifiers trained on it were on average 20.18% less accurate. This is because the classifiers trained on the KDDCup99 dataset exhibited a bias towards the redundancies within it, allowing them to achieve higher accuracies.",40
Analyzing navigational data and predicting student grades using support vector machine,"SriUdaya Damuluri, Khondkar Islam, Pouyan Ahmadi, Namra Shafiq Qureshi",2020/8/1,Journal Emerging Science Journal,"The advent of Learning Management System (LMS) has unfolded a unique opportunity to predict student grades well in advance which benefits both students and educational institutions. The objective of this study is to investigate student access patterns and navigational data of Blackboard (Bb), a form of LMS, to forecast final grades. This research study consists of students who are pursuing a Networking course in Information Science and Technology Department (IST) at George Mason University (GMU). The gathered data consists of a wide variety of attributes, such as the amount of time spent on lecture slides and other learning materials, number of times course contents are accessed, time and days of the week study material is reviewed, and student grades in various assessments. By analyzing these predictors using Support Vector Machine, one of the most efficient classification algorithms available, we are able to project final grades of students and identify those individuals who are at risk for failing the course so that they can receive proper guidance from instructors. After comparing actual grades with predicted grades, it is concluded that our developed model is able to accurately predict grades of 70% of the students. This study stands unique as it is the first to employ solely online LMS data to successfully deduce academic outcomes of students.",23

An architecture for delivery of distance education in developing countries,"Khondkar R Islam, Charles M Snow",2011/10/20,Book Proceedings of the 2011 conference on Information technology education,"Distance Education (DE) is becoming more popular due to the flexibility it offers to students of all ages, across varied professions, to take classes from any location in the world. In the face of the slow growth of education in developing nations like Bangladesh, DE can be leveraged to boost literacy rates there. Teaching staff shortages are a prime contributing factor to this slow growth. Numerous distance learning tools are on the market for delivering instruction to students in remote locations. The question is how effectively these tools can be used by individuals accessing instruction materials from locations in a developing country where there is limited network capacity.

Cisco Academy Support Center and Distance Education Course,"K Islam, LD Alessandro",2013,Journal Proc. of the Ninth International Conference on Networking and Services (ICNS),"Technology (IT) over the past 20 years, an abundance of job opportunity requirements for a variety of IT specialists in high technology corporations and the US Federal Government is apparent and is continually growing. George Mason University (Mason), with over 33,000 students enrolled located in Northern Virginia, has become the focal point for educating IT professionals to fill this need. Recognizing this opportunity, in 2005, Mason became a Cisco Regional Academy not only because of prestige and recognition, but also to add value to the networking concentration of the undergraduate IT degree of the Department of Applied IT (AIT). Now, the Academy has 45 active Cisco Academies from Virginia, Maryland and Washington, DC areas. This year Cisco shared their upcoming Academy restructuring initiative with Mason, and asked whether the university is receptive to this transition in becoming a Cisco Academy Support Center (ASC) and Instructor Training Center (ITC). Mason has been successful in the role of a Regional Academy, and was positive toward Cisco’s offer. This year, Mason has officially become an ASC that will serve 55 Cisco Academies in the State of Virginia and is in the process of becoming an ITC in May 2013.
