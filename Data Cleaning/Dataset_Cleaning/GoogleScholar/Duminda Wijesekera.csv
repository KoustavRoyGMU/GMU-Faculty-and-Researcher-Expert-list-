"Scalable, graph-based network vulnerability analysis","Paul Ammann, Duminda Wijesekera, Saket Kaushik",2002/11/18,Book Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"Even well administered networks are vulnerable to attack. Recent work in network security has focused on the fact that combinations of exploits are the typical means by which an attacker breaks into a network. Researchers have proposed a variety of graph-based algorithms to generate attack trees (or graphs). Either structure represents all possible sequences of exploits, where any given exploit can take advantage of the penetration achieved by prior exploits in its chain, and the final exploit in the chain achieves the attacker's goal. The most recent approach in this line of work uses a modified version of the model checker NuSMV as a powerful inference engine for chaining together network exploits, compactly representing attack graphs, and identifying minimal sets of exploits. However, it is also well known that model checkers suffer from scalability problems, and there is good reason to doubt whether a model …",1138
A logic-based framework for attribute based access control,"Lingyu Wang, Duminda Wijesekera, Sushil Jajodia",2004/10/29,Book Proceedings of the 2004 ACM workshop on Formal methods in security engineering,"Attribute based access control (ABAC) grants accesses to services based on the attributes possessed by the requester. Thus, ABAC differs from the traditional discretionary access control model by replacing the subject by a set of attributes and the object by a set of services in the access control matrix. The former is appropriate in an identity-less system like the Internet where subjects are identified by their characteristics, such as those substantiated by certificates. These can be modeled as attribute sets. The latter is appropriate because most Internet users are not privy to method names residing on remote servers. These can be modeled as sets of service options. We present a framework that models this aspect of access control using logic programming with set constraints of a computable set theory [DPPR00]. Our framework specifies policies as stratified constraint flounder-free logic programs that admit primitive …",368
Detecting VoIP floods using the Hellinger distance,"Hemant Sengar, Haining Wang, Duminda Wijesekera, Sushil Jajodia",2008/4/25,Journal IEEE transactions on parallel and distributed systems,"Voice over IP (VoIP), also known as Internet telephony, is gaining market share rapidly and now competes favorably as one of the visible applications of the Internet. Nevertheless, being an application running over the TCP/IP suite, it is susceptible to flooding attacks. If flooded, as a time-sensitive service, VoIP may show noticeable service degradation and even encounter sudden service disruptions. Because multiple protocols are involved in a VoIP service and most of them are susceptible to flooding, an effective solution must be able to detect and overcome hybrid floods. As a solution, we offer the VoIP flooding detection system (vFDS)-an online statistical anomaly detection framework that generates alerts based on abnormal variations in a selected hybrid collection of traffic flows. It does so by viewing collections of related packet streams as evolving probability distributions and measuring abnormal variations in …",204
Model-based covert timing channels: Automated modeling and evasion,"Steven Gianvecchio, Haining Wang, Duminda Wijesekera, Sushil Jajodia",2008,"Conference Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection: 11th International Symposium, RAID 2008, Cambridge, MA, USA, September 15-17, 2008. Proceedings 11","The exploration of advanced covert timing channel design is important to understand and defend against covert timing channels. In this paper, we introduce a new class of covert timing channels, called model-based covert timing channels, which exploit the statistical properties of legitimate network traffic to evade detection in an effective manner. We design and implement an automated framework for building model-based covert timing channels. Our framework consists of four main components: filter, analyzer, encoder, and transmitter. The filter characterizes the features of legitimate network traffic, and the analyzer fits the observed traffic behavior to a model. Then, the encoder and transmitter use the model to generate covert traffic and blend with legitimate network traffic. The framework is lightweight, and the overhead induced by model fitting is negligible. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed …",193
Provisions and obligations in policy management and security applications,"Claudio Bettini, Sushil Jajodia, X Sean Wang, Duminda Wijesekera",2002/1/1,Book VLDB'02: Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Very Large Databases,"This chapter illustrates that policy management, in a complex system, calls for more dynamic mechanisms like provisions and obligations. Policies are widely used in many systems and applications. Recently, it has been recognized that a “yes/no” response to every scenario is just not enough for many modern systems and applications. Many policies require certain conditions to be satisfied and actions to be performed before, or after, a decision is made. In a computer system, policies provide the basis for the design of its underlying control mechanisms. An access control policy defines what information users are authorized to read or modify. Most research on policies, however, has been on traditional static policies where user requests are only evaluated based on the currently available information and only “yes/no” decisions are made. For modem applications (for example, business-to …",152
A propositional policy algebra for access control,"Duminda Wijesekera, Sushil Jajodia",2003/5/1,Journal ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),"Security-sensitive environments protect their information resources against unauthorized use by enforcing access control mechanisms driven by access control policies. Due to the need to compare, contrast, and compose such protected information resources, access control policies regulating their manipulation need to be compared, contrasted, and composed. An algebra for manipulating such access control policies at a higher (propositional) level, where the operations of the algebra are abstracted from their specification details, is the subject of this paper. This algebra is applicable to policies that have controlled nondeterminism and all or nothing assignments of access privileges in their specification. These requirements reflect current practices in discretionary and role-based access control models. Therefore, the proposed algebra can be used to reason about role-based access control policies combined with …",147
SQLProb: a proxy-based architecture towards preventing SQL injection attacks,"Anyi Liu, Yi Yuan, Duminda Wijesekera, Angelos Stavrou",2009/3/8,Book Proceedings of the 2009 ACM symposium on Applied Computing,"SQL injection attacks (SQLIAs) consist of maliciously crafted SQL inputs, including control code, used against Database-connected Web applications. To curtail the attackers' ability to generate such attacks, we propose an SQL Proxy-based Blocker (SQLProb). SQLProb harnesses the effectiveness and adaptivity of genetic algorithms to dynamically detect and extract users' inputs for undesirable SQL control sequences. Compared to state-of-the-art protection mechanisms, our method does not require any code changes on either the client, the web-server or the back-end database. Rather, our system uses a proxy that seamlessly integrates with existing operational environments offering protection to front-end web servers and back-end databases. To evaluate the overhead and the detection performance of our system, we implemented a prototype of SQLProb which we tested using real SQL attacks. Our …",146
VoIP intrusion detection through interacting protocol state machines,"Hemant Sengar, Duminda Wijesekera, Haining Wang, Sushil Jajodia",2006/6/25,Conference International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'06),"Being a fast-growing Internet application, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) shares the network resources with the regular Internet traffic, and is susceptible to the existing security holes of the Internet. Moreover, given that voice communication is time sensitive and uses a suite of interacting protocols, VoIP exposes new forms of vulnerabilities to malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a highlyneeded VoIP intrusion detection system. Our approach is novel in that, it utilizes not only the state machines of network protocols but also the interaction among them for intrusion detection. This detection approach is particularly suited for protecting VoIP applications, in which a melange of protocols are involved to provide IP telephony services. Based on tracking deviations from interacting protocol state machines, our solution shows promising detection characteristics and low runtime impact on the perceived quality of …",145
DNPSec: Distributed network protocol version 3 (DNP3) security framework,"Munir Majdalawieh, Francesco Parisi-Presicce, Duminda Wijesekera",2006/1,"Journal Advances in Computer, Information, and Systems Sciences, and Engineering","Distributed Network Protocol Version 3 (DNP3) is an open and optimized protocol developed for the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems supporting the utilities industries. The DNP3 enables the Master Station to request data from Substations using pre-defined control function commands and Substations to respond by transmitting the requested data. DNP3 was never designed with security mechanisms in mind and therefore the protocol itself lacks any form of authentication or encryption. Discussion so far has been centered on two solutions to provide security for SCADA: cryptographic technologies placed at each end of the communication medium, or security enhancements placed directly in the protocol. This paper recommends a new Distributed Network Protocol Version 3 Security (DNPSec) framework to enable confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity placed directly in the DNP3. Such …",134
"Modern intrusion detection, data mining, and degrees of attack guilt","Steven Noel, Duminda Wijesekera, Charles Youman",2002,Journal Applications of data mining in computer security,"This chapter examines the state of modern intrusion detection, with a particular emphasis on the emerging approach of data mining. The discussion parallels two important aspects of intrusion detection: general detection strategy (misuse detection versus anomaly detection) and data source (individual hosts versus network traffic). Misuse detection attempts to match known patterns of intrusion, while anomaly detection searches for deviations from normal behavior. Between the two approaches, only anomaly detection has the ability to detect unknown attacks. A particularly promising approach to anomaly detection combines association raining with other forms of machine learning such as classification. Moreover, the data source that an intrusion detection system employs significantly impacts the types of attacks it can detect. There is a tradeoff in the level of detailed information available versus data volume …",132
Constructive modal logics I,Duminda Wijesekera,1990/12/14,Journal Annals of Pure and Applied Logic,"We often have to draw conclusions about states of machines in computer science and about states of knowledge and belief in artificial intelligence (AI) based on partial information. Nerode (1990) suggested using constructive (equivalently, intuitionistic) logic as the language to express such deductions and also suggested designing appropriate intuitionistic Kripke frames to express the partial information. Following this program, Nerode and Wijesekera (1990) developed syntax, semantics and completeness for a system of intuitionistic dynamic logic for proving properties of concurrent programs. Like all dynamics logics, this was a logic of many modalities, each expressing a program, but in intuitionistic rather than in classical logic. In that logic, both box and diamond are needed, but these two are not intuitionistically interdefinable and, worse, diamond does not distribute over ‘or’, except for sequential programs …",122
Securing OLAP data cubes against privacy breaches,"Lingyu Wang, Sushil Jajodia, Duminda Wijesekera",2004/5/12,"Conference IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2004. Proceedings. 2004",An OLAP (On-line Analytic Processing) system with insufficient security countermeasures may disclose sensitive information and breach an individual's privacy. Both unauthorized accesses and malicious inferences may lead to such inappropriate disclosures. Existing access control models in relational databases are unsuitable for the multi-dimensional data cubes used by OLAP. Inference control methods in statistical databases are expensive and apply to limited situations only. We first devise a flexible framework for specifying authorization objects in data cubes. The framework can partition a data cube both vertically based on dimension hierarchies and horizontally based on slices of data. We then study how to control inferences in data cubes. The proposed method eliminates both unauthorized accesses and malicious inferences. Its effectiveness does not depend on specific types of aggregation functions …,120
Experimental evaluation of loss perception in continuous media,"Duminda Wijesekera, Jaideep Srivastava, Anil Nerode, Mark Foresti",1999/11,Journal Multimedia systems," Perception of multimedia quality, specified by quality-of-service (QoS) metrics, can be used by system designers to optimize customer satisfaction within resource bounds enforced by general-purpose computing platforms. Media losses, rate variations and transient synchronization losses have been suspected to affect human perception of multimedia quality. This paper presents metrics to measure such defects, and results of a series of user experiments that justify such speculations. Results of the study provide bounds on losses, rate variations and transient synchronization losses as a function of user satisfaction, in the form of Likert values. It is shown how these results can be used by algorithm designers of underlying multimedia systems.",111
Quality of service (QoS) metrics for continuous media,"Duminda Wijesekera, Jaideep Srivastava",1996/9,Journal Multimedia Tools and Applications,"This paper presents quality of service (QoS) metrics for continuity and synchronization specifications in continuous media (CM). Proposed metrics specify continuity and synchronization, with tolerable limits on average and bursty defaults from perfect continuity, timing and synchronization constraints. These metrics can be used in a distributed environment for resource allocation. Continuity specification of a CM stream consists of its sequencing, display rate and drift profiles. The sequencing profile of a CM stream consists of tolerable aggregate and consecutive frame miss ratios. Rate profiles specify the average rendition rate and its variation. Given a rate profile, the ideal time unit for frame display is determined as an offset from the beginning of the stream. Drift profile specifies the average and bursty deviation of schedules for frames from such fixed points in time. Synchronization requirements of a collection …",100
Implementing security policies in software development tools,"Khaled S Alghathbar, Duminda Wijesekera",2008/3/4,Patent office US,Disclosed is an access and information flow control framework. The framework includes: creating consistent and conflict-free authorization requirement (s) from the raw authorization requirement (s); creating consistent case authorization (s); creating information flow and propagated information flow requirement (s) that are consistent with an information flow policy; creating operation authorization (s); resolving inconsistencies in operation authorization (s); and ensuring that the operation authorization (s) are conflict-free.,83
Provisions and obligations in policy rule management,"Claudio Bettini, Sushil Jajodia, X Sean Wang, Duminda Wijesekera",2003/9,Journal Journal of Network and Systems Management,"Policies in modern systems and applications play an essential role. We argue that decisions based on policy rules should take into account the possibility for the users to enable specific policy rules, by performing actions at the time when decisions are being rendered, and/or by promising to perform other actions in the future. Decisions should also consider preferences among different sets of actions enabling different rules. We adopt a formalism and mechanism devised for policy rule management in this context, and investigate in detail the notion of obligations, which are those actions users promise to perform in the future upon firing of a specific policy rule. We also investigate how obligations can be monitored and how the policy rules should be affected when obligations are either fulfilled or defaulted.",83

This is a comprehensive study of the problem of revoking such rights, and on the impact different revocation schemes may have on the chains. Three main revocation characteristics are identified: the extent of the revocation to other grantees (propagation), the effect on other grants to the same grantee (dominance), and the permanence of the negation of rights (resilience). A classification is devised using these three dimensions. The different schemes thus obtained are described, and compared to other models from the literature.",82
Executable misuse cases for modeling security concerns,"Jon Whittle, Duminda Wijesekera, Mark Hartong",2008/5/10,Book Proceedings of the 30th international conference on Software engineering,"Misuse cases are a way of modeling negative requirements, that is, behaviors that should not occur in a system. In particular, they can be used to model attacks on a system as well as the security mechanisms needed to avoid them. However, like use cases, misuse cases describe requirements in a high-level and informal manner. This means that, whilst they are easy to understand, they do not lend themselves to testing or analysis. In this paper, we present an executable misuse case modeling language which allows modelers to specify misuse case scenarios in a formal yet intuitive way and to execute the misuse case model in tandem with a corresponding use case model. Misuse scenarios are given in executable form and mitigations are captured using aspect-oriented modeling. The technique is useful for brainstorming potential attacks and their mitigations. Furthermore, the use of aspects allows mitigations to …",81
Fast detection of denial-of-service attacks on IP telephony,"Hemant Sengar, Haining Wang, Duminda Wijesekera, Sushil Jajodia",2006/6/19,Conference 200614th IEEE International Workshop on Quality of Service,"Recently voice over IP (VoIP) is experiencing a phenomenal growth. Being a real-time service, VoIP is more susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks than regular Internet services. Moreover, VoIP uses multiple protocols for call control and data delivery, making it vulnerable to various DoS attacks at different protocol layers. An attacker can easily disrupt VoIP services by flooding TCP SYN packets, UDP-based RTP packets, or SIP-based INVITE messages, which pose a critical threat to IP telephony. In this paper, we present an online statistical detection mechanism, called vFDS, to detect DoS attacks in the context of VoIP. The core of vFDS is based on Hellinger distance method, which computes the variability between two probability measures. Using Hellinger distance, we characterize normal protocol behaviors and then detect the traffic anomalies caused by flooding attacks. Our experimental results show …",75

Cardinality-based inference control in data cubes,"Lingyu Wang, Duminda Wijesekera, Sushil Jajodia",2004/1/1,Journal Journal of Computer Security,"This paper addresses the inference problem in on-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems. The inference problem occurs when the exact values of sensitive attributes can be determined through answers to OLAP queries. Most existing inference control methods are computationally expensive for OLAP systems, because they ignore the special structures of OLAP queries. By exploiting such structures, we derive cardinality-based sufficient conditions for safe OLAP data cubes. Specifically, data cubes are safe from inferences if their core cuboids are dense enough, in the sense that the number of known values is under a tight bound. We then apply the sufficient conditions on the basis of a three-tier inference control model. The model introduces an aggregation tier between data and queries. The aggregation tier represents a collection of safe data cubes that are pre-computed over a partition of the data using the …",58

Policy-based dissemination of partial web-ontologies,"Saket Kaushik, Duminda Wijesekera, Paul Ammann",2005/11/11,Book Proceedings of the 2005 workshop on Secure web services,"Traditional discretionary access control, without data alteration operators, applied directly on ontologies can result in revealing unintended information because ontologies contain meta-information about objects. As an alternative we provide a constraint logic programming based policy language that can extract, rove or desensitize sensitive concepts in ontologies prior to requested disclosures. Our policies are stratified Horn clauses with constructive negation, and our constraint syst uses a finitary syst of ZF sets developed by Dovier et al. - and consequently, admits a three-valued Kripke-Kleene santics. Consequently, it is suitable for safeguarding meta-information stored on the Santic web using OWL. We show how our three-valued santics faithfully represents traditional OWL santics.",50

In this paper we propose a lightweight framework for hosting Web services on mobile devices. We further evaluate and provide a comparative analysis for hosting RESTful Web services versus SOAP-based Web services on our framework. Our experimental results and analysis indicate that RESTful Web services are less resource consuming and more efficient for the implementation and provisioning of Web services from resource-constrained mobile devices.",49

Policy algebras for access control the predicate case,"Duminda Wijesekera, Sushil Jajodia",2002/11/18,Book Proceedings of the 9th ACM conference on Computer and Communications Security,"This paper deals with the algebra used to compose access control policies of collaborating organizations.

This paper extends the algebra to many sorted first order predicate case. The predicate version can be used to reason about first order properties of security policies from their components. We show how to compose and reason about security properties such as those used in role based access control models usually specified using second order (set) quantifiers in languages (see RCL2000 [1]).

We show that the collection of such even MDR queries is safe if and only if a special set of sum-two queries (that is, queries involving exactly two values) is safe. On the basis of this result, we give an efficient method to decide the safety of even MDR queries. Besides safe even MDR queries we show that any odd MDR query is unsafe. Moreover, any such odd MDR query is different from the union of some even MDR queries by only one tuple. We also extend those results to the safe subsets of unsafe even MDR queries.",43

Pattern Directed Mining of Sequence Data.,"Valery Guralnik, Duminda Wijesekera, Jaideep Srivastava",1998/8/27,Conference KDD,"Sequence data arise naturally in many applications, and can be viewed as an ordering of events, where each event has an associated time of occurrence. An important characteristic of event sequences is the occurrence of episodes, ie a collection of events occurring in a certain pattern. Of special interest are frequent episodes, ie episodes occurring with a frequency above a certain threshold. In this paper, we study the problem of mining for frequent episodes in sequence data. We present a framework for efficient mining of frequent episodes which goes beyond previous work in a number of ways. First, we present a language for specifying episodes of interest. Second, we describe a novel data structure, called the sequential pattern tree (SP Tree), which captures the relationships specified in the pattern language in a very compact manner. Third, we show how this data structure can be used by a standard bottom-up mining algorithm to generate frequent episodes in an efficient manner. Finally, we show how the SP Tree can be optimized by sharing common conditions, and evaluating each such expression only once. We present the results of an evaluation of the proposed techniques.",40
Status-based access control,"Steve Barker, Marek J Sergot, Duminda Wijesekera",2008/10/1,Journal ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),"Despite their widespread adoption, Role-based Access Control (RBAC) models exhibit certain shortcomings that make them less than ideal for deployment in, for example, distributed access control. In the distributed case, standard RBAC assumptions (e.g., of relatively static access policies, managed by human users, with complete information available about users and job functions) do not necessarily apply. Moreover, RBAC is restricted in the sense that it is based on one type of ascribed status, an assignment of a user to a role. In this article, we introduce the status-based access control (SBAC) model for distributed access control. The SBAC model (or family of models) is based on the notion of users having an action status as well as an ascribed status.

The general public have put a lot of trust in voice communication and they have been relying on it for many critical and sensitive information exchange (e.g., emergency 911 calls, calls to customer service of financial institutions). Now more and more voice calls are carried, at least partially, over the public Internet rather than traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The security ramifications of using VoIP, however, have not been fully recognized. It is not clear how secure and trustworthy the currently deployed VoIP systems are, and there exists a substantial gap in the understanding of the potential impact of VoIP exploits on the VoIP users. In this paper, we seek to fill this gap by investigating the trust issues of currently deployed VoIP systems and their implications to the VoIP users.",37

An authorization model for multimedia digital libraries,"Naren Kodali, Csilla Farkas, Duminda Wijesekera",2004/11/1,Journal International Journal on Digital Libraries,"In this paper we present a generalized authorization model for digital libraries. Our aim is to support the enforcement of access control requirements of the original data sources without without the need to create a new, unified model for the digital library. We integrate the three most widely used access control models (ie, Mandatory, Discretionary, and Role-Based Access Control) within a single framework, allowing seamless accesses to data protected by these security models. In particular, we address the access control needs of continuous multimedia data, while supporting Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and preserving operational semantics. The technical core of the paper focuses on the development of metadata and corresponding metastructure to represent authorization policies and QoS requirements, and show their applicabilty to continuous multimedia. More specifically, we define our security objects based on the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL), that controls multimedia presentation. Following the synchronization constructs< par> and< seq> of SMIL, we define a normal form for multimedia streams, called SMIL Normal Form. SMIL Normal Form provides a syntax independent representation of semantically equivalent multimedia data. SMIL Normal Form compositions are extended (decorated) with RDF statements, representing security and QoS metadata. Interpretation of these statements, and therefore the authorization and QoS requirements of the decorated multimedia object, is defined by the metastructure, represented as a DAML+ OIL ontology.

The main challenge is that sensitive data can be inferred from answers to seemingly innocent aggregations of the data. This volume reviews a series of methods that can precisely answer data cube-style OLAP, regarding sensitive data while provably preventing adversaries from inferring data.

ADS-Bsec: A holistic framework to secure ADS-B,"Thabet Kacem, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo Costa",2018/10/4,Journal IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,"Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) is one the most prominent air traffic surveillance technologies that emerged in recent years. It can be used not only as a complement to existing radar-based technologies to locate aircraft, but also as a replacement in areas without radar coverage. However, a major flaw in the deployment of this technology is its reliance on clear-text, open broadcast of messages, which makes it vulnerable to attackers. In this paper, we propose ADS-Bsec, a holistic framework that solves the root cause of ADS-B problems by enforcing the much needed authenticity and integrity in ADS-B messages. It does so without changing the message format, and along with a proper key exchange mechanism. In addition, our framework also leverages results from radio-location and risk-adaptive techniques in order to prevent attacks targeting ADS-B. An important characteristic of our …",14

Constructive concurrent dynamic logic i,"Anil Nerode, Duminda Wijesekera",1990,Volume 90,"This is the first paper on constructive concurrent dynamic logic (CCDL). For the first time, either for concurrent or sequential dynamic logic, we give a satisfactory treatment of what statements are forced to be true by partial information about the underlying computer. Dynamic logic was developed by Pratt (42, 43] for nondeterministic sequential programs, and by Peleg (39, 40) for concurrent programs, for the purpose of proving properties of programs such as correctness. Here we define what it means for a dynamic logic formula to be forced to be true knowing only partial information about the results of assignments and tests. This informal CCDL semantics is formalized by intuitionistic Kripke frames modeling this partial information, and each such frame is interpreted as an idealized concurrent machine (a concurrent transition system). In CCDL, proofs and deductions are w-height, w-branching, well-founded labeled subtrees of WW. These are a generalization of the signed tableaux of Nerode [34, 35] stemming from the prefix tableaux of Fitting [8. We demonstrate the correctness of our tableau proofs, define consistency properties, prove consistency properties yield models, construct systematic tableaux, prove systematic tableaux yield a consistency property, and conclude that CCDL is complete. This infinitary semantics and proof procedure will be the primary guide for defining, in a sequel,"" the"" correct finitary CCDL (FCCDL) based on induction principles. FCCDL is suitable for implementation in constructive logic software systems such as Constable's",14

Communications security concerns in communications based train control,"Mark Hartong, Rajni Goel, Duminda Wijesekera",2006/6/22,Journal WIT Transactions on The Built Environment,"Since the late 1980s, Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) Systems for freight and passenger rail have been under development in the United States. These systems have been advertised as offering significant enhancements in safety by ensuring positive train separation, enforcing speed restrictions, and improving roadway worker protection. In order to maximize the effect of these safety enhancements, it is necessary for CBTC systems to address security issues common to wireless computer communication systems. This paper introduces the role that CBTC systems play in railroad methods of operations, as well as the vulnerabilities of communications systems being manifested in CBTC. It provides a classification of attacks against CBTC systems, and identifies the security controls to mitigate these attacks. The level of risks associated with these security issues have increased from the first CBTC system introduction, primary because of increases in the means of exploiting the associated vulnerabilities. Exploitation that could compromise the system safety capabilities can take the form of any number of different types of attacks (eg jamming, etc). Failure of the CBTC system designer to adequately address these attacks could allow a malicious party to exploit CBTC vulnerabilities, effectively neutralizing the safety advantages of a CBTC system. Recent non-CBTC train-to-train collisions causing release of toxic inhalants and resulting deaths illustrate that a lack of CBTC system safety capabilities could have catastrophic results. Fortunately, these attacks can be mitigated using various security controls. Understanding the attacks and the …",11

This can be attributed to their coarseness in filtering out undesirable messages from desirable ones. As a result policies to control undesirable messages are often overly permissive. To allow policies to be more restrictive, the transmission mechanism must be made aware of the ways to document a message so that it is acceptable downstream, thus giving the senders a chance of meeting those requirements. In this work, we design a scheme to enable rejected, but desirable messages to be upgraded in a way that they meet downstream requirements. We call this process 'message refinement'. This in turn allows downstream principals to express and enforce precise requirements as the risk of losing desirable messages is minimized.

Money laundering detection framework to link the disparate and evolving schemes,"Murad Mehmet, Duminda Wijesekera, Miguel F Buchholtz",2013,"Description Money launderers hide traces of their transactions with the involvement of entities that participate in sophisticated schemes.

In this model, doctrine, policy and organizational structures are treated as rule-based constraints on system behavior. This will allow both analytical and simulation modeling of alternative BDM strategies based on varying scenarios. Alternative proposals can be evaluated side by side by analysis and simulation of the effects of putting in and taking out physical and rule based agents and constraints for alternative sensors, launch systems, threat-evaluation systems, command and control systems, and doctrine.

However, ADS-B messages do not include any integrity or authenticity thus they can be easily tampered using inexpensive hardware and open source software. Modifying ADS-B message format is infeasible because it would render the already large implemented base obsolete. This paper proposes ADS-Bsec, which addresses the ADS-B limitations while being compatible with the installed base. ADS-Bsec provides the missing integrity and authenticity into ADS-B packets using a key management infrastructure without altering the existing packet format. This paper also argues for including the proposed framework as a component of the NextGen infrastructure based on our experience in prototyping efforts using …",8
Key distribution scheme for aircraft equipped with secure ADS-B IN,"Thabet Kacem, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo Costa",2017/10/16,Conference 2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),"We propose a new framework to verify the authenticity and integrity of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) messages that extends our previous work by enabling in aircraft equipped with ADS IN technology to validate the integrity of location updates received from nearby aircraft. We include security metadata in each ADS-B message, to be used instead of the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), consisting of a pair of keyed hash message authentication code (HMAC) digests. Each digest is obtained by running a HMAC algorithm with a different key which could be used to authenticate ADS-B messages at ground component and nearby aircraft. The novelty of this paper consists of our usage of a commutative group key management scheme that does not send the group key over the air, but instead provides mechanisms to update it.

Risk-adaptive engine for secure ADS-B broadcasts,"T Kacem, J Carvalho, D Wijesekera, P Costa, M Monteiro, A Barreto",2015/9,"Description Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B)[1] is a technology that can be viewed either as a complement or as an alternative to current radar-based surveillance techniques. Despite its many benefits, this technology suffers from the security flaw of having its messages sent as clear text broadcasts, which makes it vulnerable to several kinds of attacks affecting the authenticity and integrity of ADS-b messages-a problem we addressed with a security framework presented in previous work [2]. In this paper, we propose to enhance that initial work by using keyed-hash message authentication code [3](HMAC) to ensure the authenticity and integrity of ADS-B messages. The proposed improvements include changing the structure of the security-related data and, more importantly, adding a cognitive risk adaptive module. These improvements resulted in four main contributions. First, the new structure of the security-related data is more resilient to messages being lost or scrambled. Second, the risk-adaptive cognitive engine facilitates the physical risk assessment of the ADS-B attacks, based on the collected data describing the aircraft and its surrounding environment. Third, air traffic controllers using the framework have better support for optimizing the use of the air space and minimizing disruptions. Fourth, the framework improves adaptability of ATC surveillance operations by leveraging the collected physical data from the aircraft.","Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B)[1] is a technology that can be viewed either as a complement or as an alternative to current radar-based surveillance techniques.

A composite risk model for railroad operations utilizing positive train control (PTC),"Andre’ Abadie, Damindra Bandara, Duminda Wijesekera",2014/4/2,Conference ASME/IEEE Joint Rail Conference,"This paper proposes a novel approach for composite risk management of rail operations incorporating operational risk computed by the rail industry and cyber security risk introduced due to Positive Train Control (PTC). The suggested risk model focuses on a given train location to estimate likelihood of the PTC system failing by considering environmental risk factors (precipitation, vegetation, obstacles) and the inherent vulnerability of the radio frequency — yielding a measure of system impact. For the same location, the risk model considers safety related attributes such as train speed, track curvature, freight type, etc. — offering an estimate of operational consequence if there were an accident due to the failure of PTC. It is this intersection of impact / consequence that separates the proposed model from existing risk calculations of impact / likelihood. This is accomplished by distinguishing the likelihood of a safety …",5
An approach for risk assessment and mitigation in cognitive radio technologies,"Andre’ Abadie, Duminda Wijesekera",2013/1/1,"Journal International Journal of Information Privacy, Security and Integrity","Though research in the vulnerabilities of cognitive radio exists, few explore the threat vectors against both the cognitive engine and the underlying SDR infrastructure within which it operates. Presenting a risk assessment methodology, this paper takes such a holistic approach and then further contributes to the research area by offering three misuse cases that portray how the vulnerabilities discussed could be exploited. Specifically, these cases visualise the risk environment based on a denial of service, an advanced persistent threat, and an insider threat and will allow for security practitioners to anticipate how their organisations may be impacted. Finally, suggested techniques for mitigation of these risks are discussed.

We show that existing inference control methods are usually inefficient for MDR queries. We then consider parity-based inference control that restricts users to queries involving an even number of sensitive values. Such a restriction renders inferences significantly more difficult, because an even number is closed under addition and subtraction, whereas inferences target at one value. However, more sophisticated inferences are still possible with only even MDR queries. We show that the collection of all even MDR queries causes inferences if and only if a special collection of sum-two queries (that is, the summation of exactly two values) does so. The result leads to an inference control method with an improved computational complexity O (mn)(over the previous result of O (m2n)) for m MDR queries over n values. We show that …",5

Sharing Data under Genetic Privacy Laws.,"Michael Reep, Bo Yu, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo CG Costa",2016,Conference STIDS,"Clinical medical practice and biomedical research utilize genetic information for specific purposes. Irrespective of the purpose of obtaining genetic material, methodologies for protecting the privacy of patients/donors in both clinical and research settings have not kept pace with rapid genetic advances. When the usage of genetic information is not predicated on the latest laws and policies, the result places all-important patient/donor privacy at risk. Some methodologies err on the side of overly stringent policies that may inhibit research and openended diagnostic activity, whereas an opposite approach advocates a high-degree of openness that can jeopardize patient privacy, identifying patient relatives and erode the doctor-patient privilege. As a solution, we present a unique approach that is based on the premise that acceptable clinical treatment regimens are captured in workflows used by caregivers and researchers and therefore their associated purpose can be extracted from these workflows.

Data Analytics to Detect Evolving Money Laundering.,"Murad Mehmet, Duminda Wijesekera",2013,Conference STIDS,"Money laundering evolves using multiple layers of trade, multi trading methods and uses multiple components in order to evade detection and prevention techniques. Consequently, detecting money laundering requires an analytical framework that can handle large amounts of unstructured, semistructured and transactional data that stream at transactional speeds to detect business-complexities, and discover deliberately concealed relationships. Based on our prior work and a static risk model proposed in the Bank Security Act, we propose a dynamic risk model that assigns a risk score for every transaction being a potential component of a larger money-laundering scheme. We use social networks to connect missing links in such potential transaction sequences. Taken together we can provide a financial sector independent risk assessment to submitted transactions. The proposed risk model is validated using data from realistic scenarios and our already developed money laundering evolution detection framework (MLEDF) that we developed earlier using sequence matching, case-based analysis, social networks, and complex event processing to link fraudulent transaction trails. MLEDF has components to collect data, run them against business rules and evolution models, run detection algorithms and use social network analysis to connect potential participants.",3
Forensics filesystem with cluster-level identifiers for efficient data recovery,"Mohammed Alhussein, Avinash Srinivasan, Duminda Wijesekera",2012/12/10,Conference 2012 International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions,"Recovering deleted information from a hard disk has been a long standing problem. The computer forensics community has tackled information recovery through the development of file carving techniques. Two issues, however, still present significant challenges to their on-going efforts - 1) Prior knowledge of file types is required for building file carvers including file headers and footers, and 2) fragmentation prevents file carvers from successful recovery. In the research work that we present in this paper, we propose a forensics file system that embeds a special identifier in every cluster that is either currently allocated or was in the past. The identifier keeps track of every cluster mapping the clusters to a single file irrespective of the file status - existing or deleted. We modified an exFAT implementation on FUSE to implement our forensics file system. Finally, we have been able to verify via controlled experiments that …",3
Security issues in VoIP telecommunication networks,"Xiaohui Yang, Ram Dantu, Duminda Wijesekera",2012,Journal Handbook on Securing Cyber-Physical Critical Infrastructure,"The Session Initialization Protocol (SIP) working group is dedicated to the development of SIP, specified as a standard under RFC 3261 and its extensions [1]. SIP communication was developed as an application layer protocol like HTTP to create, modify, and terminate multimedia sessions among endpoints. SIP was originally designed to signal IP-based voice communication (VoIP) but has expanded into the areas of video, file transfer, and instant messaging. SIP protocol provides only the signaling for connections but does not transmit data, in contrast to the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)[2], which transmits real-time data between peers. As SIP gains prevalence, it is important to study potential security threats and analyze possible solutions. Several SIP security issues are examined in this chapter, and in addition several solutions and best practices are presented. The chapter also presents a number of vulnerabilities that are not uncommon even in large enterprises. SIP is increasingly being adapted by home users and businesses and with the increase in use comes the increase of the risk of vulnerabilities. The fundamental issues in VoIP security are unauthorized use and the compromise of the communication medium. The integrity information is compromised if any unauthorized user can view it. There are many possibilities of making the data compromise harmful for users, such as an intruding user can record conversations, modify calls, and steal personal information. This is because of the basic implementation flaws in VoIP networks. Servers, clients, and protocols have weak spots that allow for vulnerabilities. There are several …",3

Cardinality-based inference control in sum-only data cubes (extended version),"Lingyu Wang, Duminda Wijesekera, J Sushil",2002,Journal Center for Secure Information Systems Technical Report,"This paper deals with the inference problems in data warehouses and decision support systems such as on-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems. Even though OLAP systems restrict user accesses to predefined aggregations, the possibility of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive attribute values still exists. Based on a definition of non-compromiseability to mean that any member of a set of variables satisfying a given set of their aggregates can have more than one value, we derive sufficient conditions for non-compromiseability in sum-only data cubes. Specifically,(1) the non-compromiseability of multi-dimensional aggregates can be reduced to that of one dimensional aggregates,(2) full or dense core cuboids are non-compromiseable, and (3) there is a tight lower bound for the cardinality of a core cuboid to remain non-compromiseable. Based on those conditions, and a three-tiered model for controlling inferences, we provide a divideand-conquer algorithm that uniformly divides data sets into chunks and builds a data cube on each such chunk. The union of those data cubes are then used to provide users with inference-free OLAP queries.",3

Sharing Genetic Data under US Privacy Laws.,"Michael Reep, Bo Yu, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo CG Costa",2018,Conference HEALTHINF,"Clinical medical practice and biomedical research utilize genetic information for specific purposes. Irrespective of the purpose of obtaining genetic material, methodologies for protecting the privacy of patients/donors in both clinical and research settings have not kept pace with rapid advances in genetics research. When the usage of genetic information is not predicated on the latest laws and policies, the result places all-important patient/donor privacy at risk. Some methodologies err on the side of overly stringent policies that may inhibit research and open-ended diagnostic activity, whereas an opposite approach advocates a high-degree of openness that can jeopardize patient privacy, inappropriately identify disease susceptibility of patients and their genetic relatives, and thereby erode the doctor-patient privilege. As a solution, we present a framework based on the premise that acceptable clinical treatment regimens are captured in workflows used by caregivers and researchers and therefore their associated purpose are inherent to and therefore can be extracted from these workflows. We combine these purposes with applicable consents that are derived from applicable laws and practice standards to ascertain the releasability of genetic information. Given that federal, state and institutional laws, rules and regulations govern the use, retention and sharing of genetic information, we create a three-level rule hierarchy to apply the laws to a request and auto-generate consents prior to releasing.

Implementing fair wireless interfaces with off-the-shelf hardware in smart spaces,"Paul Seymer, Duminda Wijesekera",2017,Journal Proceedings on the International Conference on Internet Computing (ICOMP),"Enabling general purpose computing in most public spaces is an expensive proposition. Many public spaces facilitate mobile users with WiFi access, but do not provide ubiquitous HCI interfaces or displays for the general public to connect to, outside of wired interfaces that undermine mobility. This largely prohibits traditional computing with display-less devices such as wearable computers. In our work, we advance the current state of security and fairness enforcement for commodity wireless interfaces for mobile devices. We address fairness for public interface sharing by designing a lightweight middleware solution that inserts a control layer between USB keyboard and mouse events relayed to mobile devices over a Bluetooth HCI service. We employ the use of an authenticated messaging system by reusing fields within BLE beacons to enforce security controls that protect the smart space’s resources from access and availability attacks. If public spaces can leverage cost-effective, security-focused solutions such as ours, we believe they can turn into smart spaces, enabling more freedom of computer use within them.",2

Techno-ethical considerations: Digital forensics in the cloud,"Corinne Rogers, Michael Losavio, Changwei Liu, Duminda Wijesekera, B Popovsky",2015,Journal Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Cloud Security and Management,"The ethical foundations of digital and computational forensics help assure reliability and fairness, especially as systems move into the cloud and into the control of many. Digital and computational forensics search for truth via computer science, computer engineering, diplomatics, archival science and judicial process. That search has significant consequences: findings may impact a person’s liberty or property, a person’s life or even the political direction of a nation. Those forensic conclusions should pass scrutiny under relevant tests for reliability of all the disciplines. Inherent to this is the ethical backbone of the human factor they share as to best assure that reliability. The forensic aspect of this requires compliance and testing under the umbrella of truth-seeking systems that have evolved over millennia. They include three particular components to assure the reliability of outcomes that, properly applied, incorporate the reliability mechanisms of the other disciplines to best assure correct outcomes. These are a system of gateway rules of basic reliability, scrutiny as to weight and importance and a framework of ethics to protect the integrity of the fact-finding process. The failure to observe these, if only through ignorance, may lead to the failure of the forensic mission and, perhaps, the acquittal of the guilty, conviction of the innocent and doubts about justice in our system of justice.

Secure Interchange Routing,"Mark Hartong, Rajni Goel, Duminda Wijesekera",2011/4/1,Journal Journal of Transportation Technologies,"Locations that connect tracks from different rail-road companies—referred to as interchange points—ex- change crew, locomotives, and their associated consists. Because trains have a single degree of freedom in movement, that is, they can only operate along the tracks, any delay occurring at an interchange point causes cascading delays in connecting tracks. In addition, authentication and authorization that is expected to take place at interchanges in PTC controlled train movement may add extra delays due to mutual authentication between two security domains. In this paper we propose a model that can address safety and security con- cerns and their interrelationships that govern train movement through an interchange point.

Pixel Invisibility: Detecting Objects Invisible in Color Images,"Yongxin Wang, Duminda Wijesekera",2020/6/15,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.08383,"Despite recent success of object detectors using deep neural networks, their deployment on safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars remains questionable. This is partly due to the absence of reliable estimation for detectors' failure under operational conditions such as night, fog, dusk, dawn and glare. Such unquantifiable failures could lead to safety violations. In order to solve this problem, we created an algorithm that predicts a pixel-level invisibility map for color images that does not require manual labeling - that computes the probability that a pixel/region contains objects that are invisible in color domain, during various lighting conditions such as day, night and fog. We propose a novel use of cross modal knowledge distillation from color to infra-red domain using weakly-aligned image pairs from the day and construct indicators for the pixel-level invisibility based on the distances of their intermediate-level features.

Although the healthcare industry has widely adopted Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems, consents are still obtained and stored primarily on paper or scanned electronic documents. Integrating a consent management system for different purposes into an EMR system involves various implementation challenges.

Methodology for Enabling Forensic Analysis Using Hypervisor Vulnerabilities Data,"Ramaswamy Chandramouli, Ramaswamy Chandramouli, Anoop Singhal, Duminda Wijesekera, Changwei Liu",2019/6/5,"Publisher US Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology","Hardware/Server Virtualization is a foundational technology in a cloud computing environment and the hypervisor is the key software in that virtualized infrastructure. However, hypervisors are large pieces of software with several thousand lines of code and are therefore known to have vulnerabilities. Hence a capability to perform forensic analysis to detect, reconstruct and prevent attacks based on recent vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis is a critical requirement in cloud environments. The purpose of this document is to develop a methodology to enable this forensic analysis. Two open-source hypervisors—Xen and Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)-were chosen as platforms to illustrate the methodology, and the source for vulnerability data is the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s National Vulnerability Database (NIST-NVD). The vulnerabilities were classified in terms of hypervisor functionality, attack type, and attack source. Based on the relative distribution of vulnerabilities in a hypervisor functionality, two sample attacks were launched to exploit vulnerabilities in the target hypervisor functionality, and the associated system calls were logged. The gaps in evidence data that is required for fully detecting and reconstructing those attacks are identified and techniques required to gather missing evidence are incorporated during subsequent attack runs. This is intended to be an iterative process.",1
Stable and safe automated driving using 3-D road geometric features,"Chaitanya Yavvari, Duminda Wijesekera, Zoran Duric",2019/4/28,Conference 2019 IEEE 89th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2019-Spring),"Vehicular safety depends on road geometry and surface conditions that provide tire-terrain traction. Roads are constructed with 3-D features consisting of super-elevation, grade, horizontal profile. A driving automaton that is aware of these parameters and surface friction can make better driving decisions at optimal speeds that maintain vehicular stability. Estimation of tire-terrain friction requires a continuous 3-D surface. In order to satisfy these requirements, we extend the Open Curved Regular Grid (OpenCRG) format with a C 2  continuous surface that is dynamically generated at tire-terrain contact patches. We show that these estimates empower driving automatons to stably navigate curved elevated roads with super-elevated turns.

An Ontology for Specifying Regulation-Compliant Genetic Privacy Policies,"Michael Reep, Bo Yu, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo Costa",2018/3/25,Journal eTELEMED 2018,"Genetic information provides important diagnostic data from patients to their health care providers and researchers that match phenotype and genotype. However, both diagnostic and research data providers must be confident that using this data for either purpose protects the data provider from foreseeable privacy breaches. In order to do so, Federal and State laws are in place to specifically address genetic information in addition to the laws established to protect generic health information. State genetic privacy laws diverge widely in their level of detail and constraints on releasing data, criteria for evaluating access to such data, data owner consents required to release data, and conditions for using released data. A rule-base specifying these variations can be used as a policy language to enforce data releases from electronic health records and gene pools. In order to satisfy this need, we describe a comprehensive ontology for genetic privacy based on existing applicable laws. Our ontology is used in ontological rule bases within medical workflows that are directly integrated with electronic health records. As shown in our ongoing work, this integration provides a solid foundation for enforcing laws and regulations in preventing unlawful disclosures of genetic information.",1

One of the issues that interviewers face is to ask relevant questions that would enable them to either accept or reject entrance. Repeating questions asked at entry point interviews may render them useless because most interviewees may come prepared to answer common questions. As a solution, we present an interactive voice response system that can generate a random set of questions that are contextually relevant, of the appropriate level of difficulty and not repeated in successive question answer sessions. Furthermore our system will have the ability to limit the number of questions based on the available time, degree of difficulty of generated questions or the desired subject concentration.

Forensics over Web Services: The FWS,"Murat Gunestas, Duminda Wijesekera, Anoop Singhal",2010,Book Web Services Security Development and Architecture: Theoretical and Practical Issues,"Web services are currently a preferred way to architect and provide complex services. This complexity arises due to the composition of new services by choreographing, orchestrating and dynamically invoking existing services. These compositions create service inter-dependencies that can be misused for monetary or other gains. When a misuse is reported, investigators have to navigate through a collection of logs to recreate the attack. In order to facilitate that task, the authors propose creating forensic web services (FWS), a specialized web service that when used would securely maintain transactional records between other web services. These secure records can be re-linked to reproduce the transactional history by an independent agency. Although their work is ongoing, they show the necessary components of a forensic framework for web services and its success through a case study.",1

In a non policy-based system these policies would be hardcoded. Thus a change in a policy (eg, instead of two unsuccessful logins causing an email to be sent to the system administrator have it be three unsuccessful logins) requires recoding and recompiling.

Distributed CLP clusters as a security policy framework for email,"Saket Kaushik, Duminda Wijesekera, William Winsborough, Paul Ammann",2005,Journal Applications of Constraint Satisfaction and Programming to Computer Security Problems,"The simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) used to transmit e-mail was designed with no security related control, resulting in it being exploited as a means to send “unwanted” email (aka “spam”). Consequently, recent extensions have concentrated on policy based management of e-mail pipeline that begins with the sender and ends with the intended receiver. As a theoretical framework to address this problem, we propose a distributed constraint logic programming (CLP) based framework in which policies are CLP modules that control message flow, and transmit messages acceptable to downstream principals. Our syntax is based on using stratified Horn clauses with constructive negation. The distributed aspect is used to enable the system to move enforcement points upstream in the message flows, as well as to enable message senders and their service providers to add headers useful for downstream actors. It is facilitated by importing and exporting predicates (cf. Maher [19]) among legal participants of the email pipeline. Accordingly our semantics consists of an appropriately tailored three-valued semantics, where stratification is used to ensure the finite termination of policy goals. For efficient implementation, we propose to materialize the policies and show that the materialization structure” faithfully models” our distributed policy.",1

In the domain of multimedia, due to the grossness of human perception such stringent requirements can be relaxed. We investigate consequences of this new notion of synchrony and develop a hierarchical speci cation model for multimedia compositions. Relaxing synchronization points to time intervals make other known synchronization models a special cases ours.

Despite these advantages, ADS-B's open broadcast of clear-text messages resulted in several vulnerabilities that negatively affected its widespread usage. In previous work, we proposed ADS-Bsec as a framework that leverages technologies such as cryptography, location verification and artificial intelligence to address the core of such vulnerabilities while keeping compatibility with the original protocol.

Since most Internet of Things (IoT) devices are plug and play and do not have much memory or storage to pre-process data, it is a challenge for forensic investigators to identify and obtain relevant evidence to reconstruct attacks. As a solution, we propose using artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired techniques to automate the forensic analysis process by emulating attacks in the process of identifying and collecting forensic evidence. We used a differentiable inductive logic programming (∂ILP) system to obtain attack emulation information from different sources, such as device- and subsystem-level vulnerabilities gathered by assessing device components in an enterprise network, and to predict potential attacks from previous attacks on similar configurations. Our experimental results showed that the proposed methodology could successfully generate rules …",

In order for those results to be useful for driving automatons require quantifiable safety guarantees during night, dusk, dawn, glare, fog, rain and snow. In order to address this problem, we developed an algorithm that predicts a pixel-level invisibility map for color images that does not require manual labeling-that computes the probability that a pixel/region contains objects that are invisible in color domain, during light challenged conditions such as day, night and fog. We do so by using a novel use of cross modality knowledge distillation from color to thermal domain using weakly-aligned image pairs obtained during daylight and construct indicators for the pixel-level invisibility by mapping both the color and thermal images into a shared space. Quantitative experiments show good performance of our pixel-level invisibility masks and also the effectiveness of distilled mid-level features on object detection in thermal imagery.",

Multi-version Data recovery for Cluster Identifier Forensics Filesystem with Identifier Integrity,"Mohammed Alhussein, Duminda Wijesekera",2013,"Description Recovering deleted information from a hard disk has been a long standing problem. The computer forensics community has addressed information recovery through the development of file carving techniques. Two issues, however, still present significant challenges to their on-going efforts–1) Prior knowledge of file types is required for building file carvers including file headers and footers, and 2) fragmentation prevents file carvers from successful recovery. As a solution, we propose a forensics file system that embeds a special identifier in every cluster that is either currently allocated or was in the past. The identifier keeps track of every cluster mapping the clusters to a single file irrespective of the file status–existing or deleted. We modified an exFAT implementation on FUSE to implement our forensics file system. We also propose a hashing mechanism that can detect malicious or accidental manipulation of a cluster’s identifier. In addition, we introduce the concept of multi-version recovery, where multiple instances of a file can be recovered based on a cluster specific timestamps inserted during the write operation. Finally, using controlled experiments we have been able to verify that our proposed file system successfully recovers all deleted files in our test environment.","Recovering deleted information from a hard disk has been a long standing problem.

Forensic capabilities for service-oriented architectures,"M Shing, D Wijesekera",2012,"Publisher Monterey, California.

Service-oriented architecture (SOA) and the supporting Web Services (WS) technology hold promise to create SoSes that are interoperable, composable, extensible, and dynamically reconfigurable. The DOD has mandated the basic WS framework standards to be used in the development of its services for use in the Global Information Grid (GIG) and Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) programs. Service-level compositional techniques such as choreography, orchestration, dynamic invocation, and brokering, are used to create complex dependencies between web services belonging to different organizations. These services, however, can be exploited by rogue users when the services have localized or compositional flaws. Investigating incidents of misuse of web services requires that dependencies between service invocations be retained in a neutral and secure manner so that the alleged activity can be recreated in an undeniable way while preserving evidence that could lead to and support appropriate prosecutorial activity.

Enforcing Security Policies in Requirements Engineering Using AFUML.,"Khaled Alghathbar, Duminda Wijesekera",2008/3,Journal Int. J. Comput. Their Appl.,"AFUML is a framework to specify and verify access and flow control requirements against the access and flow control policies using UML. AFUML specifies the requirements of Use Cases and sequence diagrams, and security policies with stratified Horn clauses. It is based upon our earlier frameworks AuthUML and FlowUML that specify and verify access and flow control policies, respectively. These frameworks and AFUML capture UML’s functional requirements as predicates and apply security policies specified as finite sets of rules using them in order to verify the requirements adherence to policies. This design facilitates the application of any security policy specifiable as rules to any set of requirements, whilst providing a uniform framework to apply them in unison. This choice modularizes the two aspects of functionality and policy in the forms that are popularly used by their respective communities.",
"Securing Workﬂows with XACML, RDF and BPEL","Vijayant Dhankhar, Saket Kaushik, Duminda Wijesekera",2008,"Journal Data and Applications Security XXII: 22nd Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Data and Applications Security London, UK, July 13-16, 2008, Proceedings","The XACML is the access controller of the World Wide Web (WWW). The current reference implementation has a single policy decision point and a policy enforcement point. If XACML policies are used to control workﬂow among cooperating web services, such as those envisioned in more contemporary languages like (BPEL), it requires coordination to be policy compliant. We propose the necessary enhancements required to do so by passing contextual information that are needed for the requester to evaluate an access control decision as opposed to the standard four decision values of permit, deny, indeterminate to make a decision and an unforeseeable error occurred during evaluation. Proposed contextual information is suﬃcient to coordinate and if necessary synchronize among coordinating policy enforcement points distributed among the WWW. We show how the contextual information can be constructed and veriﬁed using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the coordination implemented using BPEL.",

Comparison of IPsec to TLS and SRTP for Securing VoIP.,"Barry Sweeney, Duminda Wijesekera",2007,Conference WOSIS,"With the IETF requirement to include Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) in every implementation of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), it is prudent to consider IPsec as a viable protocol for securing IPv6 Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions. This approach is currently inconsistent with the direction of industry, which has chosen Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) to secure the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets for VoIP sessions. A comparison of these two approaches is currently not available and this paper attempts to provide that comparison and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach so that implementers and Information Assurance (IA) architects may make an informed decision. This paper is not necessarily an IA document, but is instead focused on the comparison of the two approaches based on many factors to include IA concerns.",
Conclusion and Future Direction,"Lingyu Wang, Sushil Jajodia, Duminda Wijesekera",2007,Journal Preserving Privacy in On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP),This book has addressed the following issue: How can we achieve the seemingly conflicting goals of keeping private data secret and answering aggregate data cube queries about the private data?,
Cardinality-based Inference Control,"Lingyu Wang, Sushil Jajodia, Duminda Wijesekera",2007,Journal Preserving Privacy in On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP),"As described in previous chapters, inference problem may lead to inappropriate disclosures of sensitive data and consequently cause privacy breaches in OLAP systems. Although the restricted form of OLAP queries makes inferences more difficult, it does not completely remove the threat. Most inferences remain possible using OLAP queries, and exploiting these inferences is usually fairly easy. Although inference control has been investigated for more than thirty years with abundant results, most of the methods are computationally infeasible if directly applied to OLAP systems. This is due to two facts. First, the interactive nature of OLAP systems requires instant responses to most queries. Such a stringent requirement on performance prevents many off-line inference control methods, which have been successful in applications like releasing census data, from being applied to OLAP systems. Second, OLAP …",
Inference Control in Statistical Databases,"Lingyu Wang, Sushil Jajodia, Duminda Wijesekera",2007,Journal Preserving Privacy in On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP),"Inference control has been extensively studied in statistical databases and census data for more than thirty years, as surveyed in [I, 28, 801. The proposed methods can roughly be classified into restriction-based techniques and perturbation-based techniques. Restriction-based inference control methods prevent malicious inferences by denying some unsafe queries. The metric used to determine the safety of queries includes the minimal number of values aggregated by a query [28], the maximal number of common values aggregated by different queries [29], the approximate intervals that can be guessed from query results [47, 46, 50, 48, 49, 52, 53, 51], and the maximal rank of a matrix representing all answered queries [16]. Perturbation-based techniques add random noises to sensitive data [69], to answers of queries [7], or to database structures [64]",
Query-driven Inference Control in Data Cubes,"Lingyu Wang, Sushil Jajodia, Duminda Wijesekera",2007,Journal Preserving Privacy in On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP),"Chapter 7 describes a novel way of controlling inferences in data cubes. That is, we prevent, instead of detecting, complex inferences through restrictions on queries, and then we remove the remaining simpler inferences. This approach reduces the on-line complexity of inference control to a practical level. It also eliminates the needs for impractical assumptions by supporting a customizable criteria of sensitive information. However, the method is static, in the sense that the restrictions on queries are computed once and for all. Such a static approach may lead to unnecessary denials of queries and hence reduce the usefulness of an OLAP system, because optimal restrictions usually depend on actual incoming queries and the queries a user will eventually ask cannot always be predicted.",
Inferences in Data Cubes,"Lingyu Wang, Sushil Jajodia, Duminda Wijesekera",2007,Journal Preserving Privacy in On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP),"As discussed in Chapter 2, the characteristics that distinguish OLAP systems from general-purpose databases include restricted forms of queries, high efficiency in answering such queries, and relatively less frequent updates of data. OLAP users are more interested in well-formed queries, such as multidimensional range query [41]. These queries usually convey information about general properties. Hence, they better serve the needs of OLAP users in discovering universally applicable knowledge. Although OLAP queries usually involve the aggregation of a large amount of data, they are to be answered in merely a few seconds. Such a fast response is achieved through comprehensive pre-processing and the materialization of multi-dimensional views from which the answer to queries can be more easily derived. Although initially proposed as a relational operator, data cubes can serve as a popular model …",

Maintaining Privacy on Derived Objects,Sushil Jajodia,2005,Journal Proceedings of the ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society,"Protecting privacy means to ensure users that access to their per-sonal data complies with their preferences. However, information can be manipulated in order to derive new objects that may disclose part of the original information. Therefore, control of information flow is necessary for guaranteeing privacy protection since users should know and control not only who access their personal data, but also who access information derived from their data. Actu-ally, current approaches for access control do not provide support for managing propagation of information and for representing user preferences. This paper proposes to extend the Flexible Authorization Frame-work (FAF) in order to automatically verify whether a subject is entitled to process personal data and derive the authorizations associated with the outcome of data processing. In order to control information flow, users may specify the range of authorizations that can be associated with objects derived from their data. The frame-work guarantees that every “valid” derived object does not disclose more information than users want and preserves the permissions that users want to maintain. To make the discussion more concrete, we illustrate the proposal with a bank case study.",

Secure Bridges: A Means to Conduct Secure Teleconferences over Public Telephones,Duminda Wijesekera,2004,Journal Critical Infrastructure Protection Program: Workshop II Working Papers,"Many organizations carry out their confidential business over teleconferences with the expectation that only the declared participants are privy to the conversation. But, because public telephones do not encrypt voice, such teleconferences are vulnerable to eavesdropping. As a remedy, we offer secure bridges consisting of architectures and algorithms for eavesdropping resistant teleconferencing as a service over public switched telephone network (PSTN) with minimal additions. Our proposal consists of appropriately placing servers to authenticate telephone equipment and subscribers of the service, and certificate authorities to cross-certify them over service providers. We show how these entities and necessary signaling mechanisms between them can be implemented using the transaction capabilities application layer (TCAP) of the signal system seven (SS7) protocol suites and the D1 channel of the digital subscriber line (DSL) connecting telephone equipment to the SS7 grid. Using published delays our algorithms take about 4.25 minutes to setup a 10-person teleconference including soliciting and verifying user IDs and passwords.",
A Flexible Authorization Framework,"Duminda Wijesekera, Sushil Jajodia",2004,Book Information Security Policies and Actions in Modern Integrated Systems,"Advances in application areas such as Internet-based transactions, cooperating coalitions, and workflow systems have brought new challenges to access control. In order to meet the diverse needs of emerging applications, it has become necessary to support multiple access control policies in one security domain. This chapter describes an authorization framework, referred to as the Flexible Authorization Framework (FAF), which is capable of doing so. FAF is a logic-based framework in which authorizations are specified in terms of a locally stratified rule base. FAF allows permissions and prohibitions to be included in its specification. FAF specifications can be changed by deleting and inserting its rules. We also describe FAF’s latest additions, such as revoking granted permissions, provisional authorizations, and obligations.",

Our normal form results in a faster proof-search engine in deriving consequences of functional independencies. As a result, we get a new construction of an Armstrong relation for a given set of functional dependencies. It is also shown that an Armstrong relation for a set of functional dependencies and independencies do not exist in general, and this generalizes the same result valid under the closed-world assumption.",

"Constraints, Inference Channels and Secure","Alexander Brodsky, Csilla Farkas, Duminda Wijesekera, X Sean Wang",2000,Journal Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming: Proceedings,"This paper investigates the problem of confidentiality violations via illegal data inferences that occur when arithmetic constraints are combined with non-confidential numeric data to infer confidential information. The database is represented as a point in an (n+ k)-di-mensional constraint space, where n is the number of numerical data items stored in the database (extensional database) and k is the number of derivable attributes (intensional database). Database constraints over both extensional and intensional databases form an (n+ k)-dimensional constraint object. A query answer over a data item x is an interval I of values along the x axis of the database such that I is correct (ie, the actual data value is within 1) and safe (ie, users cannot infer which point within I is the actual data value). The security requirements are expressed by the accuracy with which users are allowed to disclose data items. More specifically, we develop two classification methods:(1) volume-based classification, where the entire volume of the disclosed con-straint object that contains the data item is considered and (2) interval based classification, where the length of the interval that contains the data item is considered. We develop correct and safe inference algorithms for both cases.",
QoS Based Evaluation of the Berkeley Continuous Media Toolkit,"D Wijesekera, S Varadarajan, S Parikh, J Srivastava, A Nerode",1999/3/1,Publisher CALIFORNIA UNIV BERKELEY,"This paper presents a performance analysis of the Continuous Media service provided by the Berkeley, Continous Media Tool kit CMT. We show a development of metrics, validation by means of a user study, and a performance evaluation of a prototyping environment. The CMT is a popular environment that satisfies our need of being easily extendible and offers a quick prototyping environment. From a human users perspective, in order for multimedia demonstrations to be comprehensible, the number of audio or video frames dropped and the timing delays in the ones that are displayed, and the degree of asynchrony between two streams such as audio and video, need to be kept within limits. Therefore, it is important to know the frame dropping, timing delay and synchronization drift characteristics of CMT. In a series of experiments we monitored the variation of these parameters with respect to processor, network and event loop loads. It was observed that loads affect aggregate frame drops at lower rates, and consecutive frame drops at higher rates. Because at a higher rates a large number of consecutive frames are dropped, the ones that are played appear in a more timely manner. It is shown that according to metrics provided by other studies, CMT provides imperceptible audio-video mis-synchronization for about 10 seconds, and tolerable synchronization for about 13 seconds, from the start of the clips for local clients under low processor loads. It is also shown that under high loads, synchronization is achieved at the cost of losing media frames.. 1,",

Simulation-based Analysis for Traffic Disruptions Caused by DoS Attacks to Railroad Cyber-Physical Systems,"Zezhou Wang, Xiang Liu, Brian Sykes, Duminda Wijesekera","With increasing cyber-physical systems (CPS) deployed in the railroad industry, corresponding cyber security has become an increasingly crucial issue. Understanding cyber risks and preparing solutions for the worst case scenarios are vitally important. It is also necessary to evaluate system resilience and recoverability under cyber breaches, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In general, the fundamental failsafe design of railroad CPS prevents unsafe train movement in the wake of certain system malfunctions. Therefore, a cyber-attack on the railroad CPS may likely invoke the CPS safe mode, acting as disruptive DoS attacks. This would cause a decline in the railroad’s capacity and throughput. In this paper, we envision that DoS attacks are potential sources of rail service disruption, and select the traffic disruption level as the indicator of a railroad CPS system’s resilience under DoS attack. In our ongoing research, we launched the development of a simulation model for rail traffic to evaluate the disruption and recoverability. The simulation model is intended to incorporate the potential DoS modeling parameters with railroad network information, observed from many probe points with traffic behavior outputs. Based on preliminary experiments on a single-track unidirectional traffic model, with heterogeneous traffic inputs simulating the mixed traffic pattern, our preliminary model is able to estimate the delay of traffic given the duration of disruption, such as DoS attacks impeding the wireless communication channels of the railroad dispatching system.","Scholar articles Simulation-based Analysis for Traffic Disruptions Caused by DoS Attacks to Railroad Cyber-Physical SystemsZ Wang, X Liu, B Sykes, D WijesekeraRelated articles ","With increasing cyber-physical systems (CPS) deployed in the railroad industry, corresponding cyber security has become an increasingly crucial issue.

AFTER: ATTACK-FAULT AND RELIABILITY MODELING OF MOVABLE RAILROAD BRIDGE SYSTEMS,"Matthew Jablonski, Yongxin Wang, Chaitanya Yavvari, Xiang Liu, Keith Holt, Duminda Wijesekera","Modern railroad movable bridge systems control physical equipment using hardware and software for communications and signaling. In these systems, unforeseen security vulnerabilities in the underlying system components could be exploited to cause service disruptions and degradations. These in turn can cause failures, resulting in unsafe operational conditions. Conversely, control systems have built in failure tolerant mechanisms (such as service degradations and terminations) that are called in response to impending or observed failures. An attacker that is aware of such mechanisms can exploit these designs to cause the triggering of service degradations and terminations, causing safety concerns. A motivated attacker can exploit the intertwined nature of these two phenomena and create complex attacks that would cause unsafe operational conditions.In this paper, we introduce a model called Attack-Fault Trees with Reliability (AFTeR), which was designed to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the intertwined ways of violating safety and cyber security objectives of a cyber-physical system design. By incorporating probabilistic estimates of fault rates, component maintenance and repair, exploitability of known security vulnerabilities in existing equipment, attacker effort and capability estimates with kill-chains that are executed by potential misbehaving agents to cause safety and security concerns, we derive operational risks and cost-minimizing mitigations strategies against them. We show the capabilities of our methods by applying it to a detailed model of a fail-safe movable railroad bridge system. This work is sponsored by FRA and …","Scholar articles AFTER: ATTACK-FAULT AND RELIABILITY MODELING OF MOVABLE RAILROAD BRIDGE SYSTEMSM Jablonski, Y Wang, C Yavvari, X Liu, K Holt…Related articles ","Modern railroad movable bridge systems control physical equipment using hardware and software for communications and signaling. In these systems, unforeseen security vulnerabilities in the underlying system components could be exploited to cause service disruptions and degradations. These in turn can cause failures, resulting in unsafe operational conditions. Conversely, control systems have built in failure tolerant mechanisms (such as service degradations and terminations) that are called in response to impending or observed failures. An attacker that is aware of such mechanisms can exploit these designs to cause the triggering of service degradations and terminations, causing safety concerns. A motivated attacker can exploit the intertwined nature of these two phenomena and create complex attacks that would cause unsafe operational conditions.",
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS,"Khaled Alghathbar, Duminda Wijesekera, Yasser Ganjisaffar, Hassan Abolhassani, Mahdi Abadi, Saeed Jalili, Synchronous Wrapper Gircuits, Esmail Amini, Mehrdad Najibi, Hossern Pedram, S Bani-Mohammad MOuld-Khaoua, L Ababneh","This paper proposes an automatic method to generate GALS wrapper circuits from the Verilog specification code of synchronous modules. Two'wrapper implementations are supported: pausible and gated clock based wrapper circuits. It has been shown that gated clock based wrappers are more appropriate than plausible clock based wrappers to be generated automatically. At the first step of wrapper generation process, the input synchronous module will be parsed and wrapper circuit components will be produced based on the specification of input synchronous module. Existing GALS wrapper generation methods waste the die size because they instantiate one asynchronous port controller for each data vector. In our improved wrapper generation method, the number of asynchronous port controllers is reduced to simultaneous data communication links. In order to validate the proposed algorithm, the wrapper circuits are implied on Viterbi error detection and correction circuit. The results show that our improved wrapper generation method will reduce the area of the wrapper circuit, compared with previous implementations.","Scholar articles INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS AND THEIR APPLICATIONSK Alghathbar, D Wijesekera, Y Ganjisaffar…Related articles ","This paper proposes an automatic method to generate GALS wrapper circuits from the Verilog specification code of synchronous modules.

Pattern Directed Mining for Frequent Episodes,"Valery Guralnik, Duminda Wijesekera, Jaideep Srivastava","Sequence data arises naturally in many applications. For example, marketing and sales data collected over a period of time provides sequences which can be analyzed and used for projections and forecasting. Abstractly, such a data collection can be viewed as a sequence of events, where each event has an associated time of occurrence. An important and interesting characteristic of event sequences is the occurrence of episodes, ie a collection of events occurring in a certain pattern [7]. Of special interest are frequent episodes, ie episodes occurring with a frequency above a certain threshold. In this paper, we study the problem of mining for frequent episodes in sequence data.

Merging Sub Evidence Graphs to an Integrated Evidence Graph,"Changwei Liu, Anoop Singhal, Duminda Wijesekera","Evidence graphs model network intrusion evidence and their dependencies, which helps network forensics analysts collate and visualize dependencies. In particular, probabilistic evidence graphs provide a way to link probabilities associated with different attack paths with available evidence. Existing work in evidence graphs assumes that all evidence is available in a single evidence graph. In this paper, we demonstrate how to merge multiple evidence graphs into a single evidence graph. We show this by providing algorithms and a possible scenario based on attacks on a fileserver and a database server in an example network environment. An integrated evidence graph, showing all attacks using global reasoning, is more useful to forensics analysts as compared to multiple evidence graphs that use local reasoning.","Scholar articles Merging Sub Evidence Graphs to an Integrated Evidence GraphC Liu, A Singhal, D WijesekeraRelated articles ","Evidence graphs model network intrusion evidence and their dependencies, which helps network forensics analysts collate and visualize dependencies.

Toward Representing and Recognizing Cyber-Physical Elements in Competition Using Event Semantics,"Alonza Mumford, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo Costa","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is observing an increasing number of incidents involving recreational drones, and imagining a future where every drone will be equipped with an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) transponder that communicates and cooperates with the FAA’s Next Generation (NextGen) Aviation Cyber-Physical System in order to help mitigate aerial collision risk [1]. This exemplar application involves human or autonomous agents interacting within some sort of cyber-physical system where competition or cooperation between cyber-physical elements exist. We anticipate that the use of higher-level abstractions will be required for modeling human or autonomous agent’s interactions within these type of systems in order to make sense of the observations derived from sensor-data. In this paper, we articulate an approach that uses event semantics to represent the temporal, spatial, factor, and outcome features of activities generated by competing or cooperating agents functioning within a cyber-physical environment. We use those semantics, along with observations of activity, to model higher-level activity abstractions and to help perform strategy recognition from a concrete, competition-oriented scenario reflected in a real-world, game data set comprised of more than a half million events involving nearly 8500 unique agents.

Intelligence and law enforcement analysts, impelled by the duty to discover connections to drug cartels and other participants in these criminal activities, require the information to be searchable and extractable from all types of data formats. In this overview paper, we articulate an approach—a capability that uses a data description language called Data Format Description Language (DFDL) extended with higherorder functions as a host language to XML Linking (XLink) and XML Pointer (XPointer) languages in order to link, discover and extract financial data fragments from raw-data stores not colocated with each other—see figure 1. The strength of the approach is grounded in the specification of a declarative compiler for our concrete language using a higher-order rewriting system with binders called Combinatory Reduction Systems Extended (CRSX).

Due to shared track rights over each-other’s tracks in North America, company A’s trains must be safely operated by company B’s crew on company C’s tracks, requiring different PTC systems to securely interoperate with each other. For a security framework to ensure that, we propose using a trust management system with certificates and over the air re-keying (OTAR). Back of the envelope calculations show that our solution meets timing needs of PTC.","Scholar articles TRUST-BASED SECURE POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL (PTC) INTEROPERATIONM Hartong, R Goel, D WijesekeraRelated articles All 3 versions ","Positive Train Control (PTC) is a wireless control system ensuring railroad safety by enforcing train separation, speed enforcement, roadway worker protection and other safety functions.

Fine-grained Sharing of Health Records using XSPA Profile for XACML-‐An Extended Abstract,"A Al-Faresi, B Yu, K Moidu, A Stavrou, D Wijesekera, A Singhal","Security and privacy concerns over the handling of electronic healthcare records have received significant attention over the past few years. In response to the increase need for sharing and maintenance of personal health records many recent publications attempt to address the thorny problem of controlling access to electronic health records (EHRs) and personal health records (PHRs). These efforts include scientific and legislative work by many organizations such as NIST, AHIC, HL7, HITSP, AHIC among others. In addition, legislation such as the Health Information Privacy and Accountability Act of 1999 and ARRA-HITECH set goals to be achievable by determining the release of EHR and PHR data are those that are used in security policies used in other areas of IT security, such as subjects, objects, roles, operations and permissions. In this extended abstract, we argue for the need to rethink and re-design some of the existing policies frameworks to adhere the needs that stem from their use in a real-world health care environment.","Scholar articles Fine-grained Sharing of Health Records using XSPA Profile for XACML-‐An Extended AbstractA Al-Faresi, B Yu, K Moidu, A Stavrou, D Wijesekera…Related articles All 2 versions ","Security and privacy concerns over the handling of electronic healthcare records have received significant attention over the past few years.

Providing Voice Privacy as a Service over the Public Telephone Network,"Mohamad Sharif, Duminda Wijesekera","Existing design of the public telephone network is susceptible to eavesdropping on its voice stream. Consequently, any wire taper can listen to supposedly private conversations. In order to prevent such eavesdropping, we propose an architecture and its implementation for end-to-end voice encryption as a service available for interested subscribers. Our proposal consists of appropriately placing servers to authenticate telephone equipment and subscribers of the service, and certificate authorities that can cross-certify over telecommunication service providers. We show how these entities and necessary signaling mechanisms between them can be implemented using the transaction capabilities application layer (TCAP) of the signal system seven (SS7) protocol and the D channel of the digital subscriber line (DSL) connecting telephone equipment to the SS7 grid. Using published specifications, we show that the duration to initiate an encrypted telephone call takes about 19 seconds including user authentication under average load conditions. That makes our design and protocols comparable to existing intelligent services provided over public telephones and only four times longer than initiating a normal telephone call.","Scholar articles Providing Voice Privacy as a Service over the Public Telephone NetworkM Sharif, D WijesekeraRelated articles ","Existing design of the public telephone network is susceptible to eavesdropping on its voice stream.
