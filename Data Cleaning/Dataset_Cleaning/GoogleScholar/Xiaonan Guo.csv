"Rass: A real-time, accurate, and scalable system for tracking transceiver-free objects","Dian Zhang, Yunhuai Liu, Xiaonan Guo, Lionel M Ni",2012/5/1,Journal IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,"Transceiver-free object tracking is to trace a moving object that does not carry any communication device in an environment with some monitoring nodes predeployed. Among all the tracking technologies, RF-based technology is an emerging research field facing many challenges. Although we proposed the original idea, until now there is no method achieving scalability without sacrificing latency and accuracy. In this paper, we put forward a real-time tracking system RASS, which can achieve this goal and is promising in the applications like the safeguard system. Our basic idea is to divide the tracking field into different areas, with adjacent areas using different communication channels. So, the interference among different areas can be prevented. For each area, three communicating nodes are deployed on the ceiling as a regular triangle to monitor this area. In each triangle area, we use a Support Vector …",189
Friend or foe? Your wearable devices reveal your personal pin,"Chen Wang, Xiaonan Guo, Yan Wang, Yingying Chen, Bo Liu",2016/5/30,Book Proceedings of the 11th ACM on Asia conference on computer and communications security,"The proliferation of wearable devices, e.g., smartwatches and activity trackers, with embedded sensors has already shown its great potential on monitoring and inferring human daily activities. This paper reveals a serious security breach of wearable devices in the context of divulging secret information (i.e., key entries) while people accessing key-based security systems. Existing methods of obtaining such secret information relies on installations of dedicated hardware (e.g., video camera or fake keypad), or training with labeled data from body sensors, which restrict use cases in practical adversary scenarios. In this work, we show that a wearable device can be exploited to discriminate mm-level distances and directions of the user's fine-grained hand movements, which enable attackers to reproduce the trajectories of the user's hand and further to recover the secret key entries.

Wi-counter: smartphone-based people counter using crowdsourced wi-fi signal data,"Haochao Li, Eddie CL Chan, Xiaonan Guo, Jiang Xiao, Kaishun Wu, Lionel M Ni",2015/8,Journal IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,"Reliable people counting is crucial to many urban applications. However, most existing people counting systems are sensor-based and can only work in some fixed gateways or checkpoints where sensors have been installed. This high dependence on the exact locations of sensors leads to low accuracy. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a smartphone-based people counting system, Wi-Counter, by leveraging the pervasive Wi-Fi infrastructure. To collect comprehensive Wi-Fi signals and people count information based on crowdsource, Wi-Counter first adopts a preprocessor to overcome the noisy, discrepant, and fragile data based on the Wiener filter and Newton interpolation. It then makes use of the designated five-layer neural network to learn the relation model between the Wi-Fi signals and the number of people.

On distinguishing the multiple radio paths in rss-based ranging,"Dian Zhang, Yunhuai Liu, Xiaonan Guo, Min Gao, Lionel M Ni",2012/3/25,Conference 2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM,"Among the various ranging techniques, Radio Signal Strength (RSS) based approaches attract intensive research interests because of its low cost and wide applicability. RSS-based ranging is apt to be affected by the multipath phenomenon which allows the radio signals to reach the destination through multiple propagation paths. To address this issue, previous works try to profile the environment and refer this profile in run-time. In practical dynamic environments, however, the profile frequently changes and the painful retraining is needed. Rather than such static ways of profiling the environments, in this paper, we try to accommodate the environmental dynamics automatically in real-time. The key observation is that given a pair of nodes, the RSS at different spectrum channels will be different. This difference carries the valuable phase information of the radio signals.

Cross-Technology Localization: Leveraging Commodity WiFi to Localize Non-WiFi Device.,"Dian Zhang, Rujun Zhang, Haizhou Guo, Peng Xiang, Xiaonan Guo",2021/11/1,Journal KSII Transactions on Internet & Information Systems,"Radio Frequency (RF)-based indoor localization technologies play significant roles in various Internet of Things (IoT) services (eg, location-based service). Most such technologies require that all the devices comply with a specified technology (eg, WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth). However, this requirement limits its application scenarios in today's IoT context where multiple devices complied with different standards coexist in a shared environment. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a cross-technology localization approach, which is able to localize target nodes using a different type of devices. Specifically, the proposed framework reuses the existing WiFi infrastructure without introducing additional cost to localize Non-WiFi device (ie, ZigBee). The key idea is to leverage the interference between devices that share the same operating frequency (eg, 2.4GHz). Such interference exhibits unique patterns that depend on the target device's location, thus it can be leveraged for cross-technology localization. The proposed framework uses Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to extract salient features of the received WiFi signals, and leverages Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) to improve the robustness of our system. We conduct experiments in real scenario and investigate the impact of different factors. Experimental results show that the average localization accuracy of our prototype can reach 1.54m, which demonstrates a promising direction of building cross-technology technologies to fulfill the needs of modern IoT context.",

Third, we categorize shops by designing an SVM classifier in shop space to support multi-label classification. Finally, we infer brand name from SSID by applying string similarity measurement. Based on over five thousand traces in three big malls in two different countries, we conclude that ShopProfiler achieves better accuracy in building refined floor plan, and characterizes shops in terms of location, category and name with little human intervention.","Sensing data from mobile phones provide us exciting and profitable applications. Recent research focuses on sensing indoor environment, but suffers from inaccuracy because of the limited reachability of human traces or requires human intervention to perform sophisticated tasks.

Wi-Fi Based Indoor Localization is Not Easy,"Luong Trung Tuan, Youngki Lee, Archan Misra, Xiaonan Guo, Rajesh Krishna Balan","Indoor localization has been a particularly active area of research in the last few years. Many solutions have been proposed. Among those, RF-based approaches [1][2][3] received more attention since it is easy to implement and has relatively high accuracy. In this demo, we take a step back and to show that even with these many solutions proposed in the last few years, indoor localization is still a hard problem. We draw this conclusion from results by our recent efforts to provide a practical indoor location system at three different dense (ie, they have large numbers of people in a very small area) public urban environments; 1) our university campus, 2) a large shopping mall, and 3), an airport. In particular, we find that the heterogeneity, power management mode, density of people in an environment, and even the relative placement of devices can have significant impacts on the RSSI values observed by the devices. This in turn can significantly affect the accuracy of localization algorithms causing errors of multiple landmark distances. Figure 1 and Figure. 2 show some of the results. In Figure 1, we see the result of RSS measured by similar devices from the same location at very similar times. Figure 2 shows another interesting result that the RSS value switched completely with the low device becoming high for phone and vice versa while in dongle case.","Scholar articles Wi-Fi Based Indoor Localization is Not EasyLT Tuan, Y Lee, A Misra, X Guo, RK BalanRelated articles All 4 versions ","Indoor localization has been a particularly active area of research in the last few years.
