Network function virtualization: Challenges and opportunities for innovations,"Bo Han, Vijay Gopalakrishnan, Lusheng Ji, Seungjoon Lee",2015/2/19,Source IEEE communications magazine,"Network function virtualization was recently proposed to improve the flexibility of network service provisioning and reduce the time to market of new services. By leveraging virtualization technologies and commercial off-the-shelf programmable hardware, such as general-purpose servers, storage, and switches, NFV decouples the software implementation of network functions from the underlying hardware. As an emerging technology, NFV brings several challenges to network operators, such as the guarantee of network performance for virtual appliances, their dynamic instantiation and migration, and their efficient placement. In this article, we provide a brief overview of NFV, explain its requirements and architectural framework, present several use cases, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this burgeoning research area.",1382
Mobile Data Offloading through Opportunistic Communications and Social Participation,"Bo Han, Pan Hui, V Kumar, M Marathe, Jianhua Shao, Aravind Srinivasan",2011/4/29,"Journal Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on","3G networks are currently overloaded, due to the increasing popularity of various applications for smartphones. Offloading mobile data traffic through opportunistic communications is a promising solution to partially solve this problem, because there is almost no monetary cost for it. We propose to exploit opportunistic communications to facilitate information dissemination in the emerging Mobile Social Networks (MoSoNets) and thus reduce the amount of mobile data traffic. As a case study, we investigate the target-set selection problem for information delivery. In particular, we study how to select the target set with only k users, such that we can minimize the mobile data traffic over cellular networks.

Cellular traffic offloading through WiFi networks,"Savio Dimatteo, Pan Hui, Bo Han, Victor OK Li",2011/10/17,Conference 2011 IEEE eighth international conference on mobile ad-hoc and sensor systems,"Cellular networks are currently facing the challenges of mobile data explosion. High-end mobile phones and laptops double their mobile data traffic every year and this trend is expected to continue given the rapid development of mobile social applications. It is imperative that novel architectures be developed to handle such voluminous mobile data. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an integrated architecture exploiting the opportunistic networking paradigm to migrate data traffic from cellular networks to metropolitan WiFi access points (APs). To quantify the benefits of deploying such an architecture, we consider the case of bulk file transfer and video streaming over 3G networks and simulate data delivery using real mobility data set of 500 taxis in an urban area.

Optimizing 360 video delivery over cellular networks,"Feng Qian, Bo Han, Lusheng Ji, Vijay Gopalakrishnan",2016/10/3,"Conference Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on All Things Cellular: Operations, Applications and Challenges","As an important component of the virtual reality (VR) technology, 360-degree videos provide users with panoramic view and allow them to freely control their viewing direction during video playback. Usually, a player displays only the visible portion of a 360 video. Thus, fetching the entire raw video frame wastes bandwidth. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing 360 video delivery over cellular networks. We first conduct a measurement study on commercial 360 video platforms. We then propose a cellular-friendly streaming scheme that delivers only 360 videos' visible portion based on head movement prediction. Using viewing data collected from real users, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, which can reduce bandwidth consumption by up to 80% based on a trace-driven simulation.",422

Performance evaluation of scheduling in IEEE 802.16 based wireless mesh networks,"Bo Han, Weijia Jia, Lidong Lin",2007/2/26,Journal Computer Communications,"IEEE 802.16 employs TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) as the access method and the policy for selecting scheduled links in a given time slot will definitely impact the system performance. We propose a collision-free centralized scheduling algorithm for IEEE 802.16 based Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) to provide high-quality wireless multimedia services. We design a relay strategy for the mesh nodes in a transmission tree, taking special considerations on fairness, channel utilization and transmission delay. We evaluated the proposed algorithm with four selection criteria through extensive simulations and the experimental results are instrumental for improving the performance of IEEE 802.16 based WMNs in terms of link scheduling.

It takes a viewport-adaptive approach, which fetches only portions of a panoramic scene that cover what a viewer is about to perceive. We conduct an IRB-approved user study where we collect head movement traces from 130 diverse users to gain insights on how to design the viewport prediction mechanism for Flare. We then develop novel online algorithms that determine which spatial portions to fetch and their corresponding qualities. We also innovate other components in the streaming pipeline such as decoding and server-side transmission. Through extensive evaluations (~400 hours' playback on WiFi and ~100 hours over LTE), we show that Flare significantly improves the QoE in real-world settings.

MP-DASH: Adaptive video streaming over preference-aware multipath,"Bo Han, Feng Qian, Lusheng Ji, Vijay Gopalakrishnan",2016/12/6,Book Proceedings of the 12th International on Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies,"Compared with using only a single wireless path such as WiFi, leveraging multipath (e.g., WiFi and cellular) can dramatically improve users' quality of experience (QoE) for mobile video streaming. However, Multipath TCP (MPTCP), the de-facto multipath solution, lacks the support to prioritize one path over another. When applied to video streaming, it may cause undesired network usage such as substantial over-utilization of the metered cellular link. In this paper, we propose MP-DASH, a multipath framework for video streaming with the awareness of network interface preferences from users. The basic idea behind MP-DASH is to strategically schedule video chunks' delivery and thus satisfy user preferences. MP-DASH can work with a wide range of off-the-shelf video rate adaptation algorithms with very small changes.

Maranello: Practical Partial Packet Recovery for 802.11.,"Bo Han, Aaron Schulman, Francesco Gringoli, Neil Spring, Bobby Bhattacharjee, Lorenzo Nava, Lusheng Ji, Seungjoon Lee, Robert R Miller",2010/4/28,Conference NSDI,"Partial packet recovery protocols attempt to repair corrupted packets instead of retransmitting them in their entirety. Recent approaches have used physical layer confidence estimates or additional error detection codes embedded in each transmission to identify corrupt bits, or have applied forward error correction to repair without such explicit knowledge. In contrast to these approaches, our goal is a practical design that simultaneously:(a) requires no extra bits in correct packets,(b) reduces recovery latency, except in rare instances,(c) remains compatible with existing 802.11 devices by obeying timing and backoff standards, and (d) can be incrementally deployed on widely available access points and wireless cards. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate Maranello, a novel partial packet recovery mechanism for 802.11. In Maranello, the receiver computes checksums over blocks in corrupt packets and bundles these checksums into a negative acknowledgment sent when the sender expects to receive an acknowledgment. The sender then retransmits only those blocks for which the checksum is incorrect, and repeats this partial retransmission until it receives an acknowledgment. Successful transmissions are not burdened by additional bits and the receiver needs not infer which bits were corrupted. We implemented Maranello using OpenFWWF (open source firmware for Broadcom wireless cards) and deployed it in a small testbed. We compare Maranello to alternative recovery protocols using a trace-driven simulation and to 802.11 using a live implementation under various channel conditions. To our knowledge, Maranello is the first …",121

Clustering wireless ad hoc networks with weakly connected dominating set,"Bo Han, Weijia Jia",2007/6/1,Journal Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,"The increasing popular personal communications and mobile computing require a wireless network infrastructure that supports self-configuration and self-management. Efficient clustering protocol for constructing virtual backbone is becoming one of the most important issues in wireless ad hoc networks. The weakly connected dominating set (WCDS) is very suitable for cluster formation. As finding the minimum WCDS in an arbitrary graph is a NP-Hard problem, we propose an area-based distributed algorithm for WCDS construction in wireless ad hoc networks with time and message complexity O(n). This Area algorithm is divided into three phases: area partition, WCDS construction for each area and adjustment along the area borders. We confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm through analysis and comprehensive simulation study. The number of nodes in the WCDS constructed by this Area algorithm is up to …",101
Parabox: Exploiting parallelism for virtual network functions in service chaining,"Yang Zhang, Bilal Anwer, Vijay Gopalakrishnan, Bo Han, Joshua Reich, Aman Shaikh, Zhi-Li Zhang",2017/4/3,Book Proceedings of the Symposium on SDN Research,"Service Function Chains (SFCs) comprise a sequence of Network Functions (NFs) that are typically traversed in-order by data flows. Consequently, SFC delay grows linearly with the length of the SFC. Yet, for highly latency sensitive applications, this delay may be unacceptable---particularly when the constituent NFs are virtualized, running on commodity servers. In this paper, we investigate how SFC latency may be reduced by exploiting opportunities for parallel packet processing across NFs. We propose ParaBox, a novel hybrid packet processing architecture that, when possible, dynamically distributes packets to VNFs in parallel and merges their outputs intelligently to ensure the preservation of correct sequential processing semantics.

In this paper, we complement prior studies by conducting, to the best of our knowledge, the first measurement study of mobile web performance over multipath TCP (MPTCP). Based on experiments using real web pages under diverse settings, we found the upper-layer web protocols can incur complex and sometimes unexpected interactions with the multipath-enabled transport layer.

Jaguar: Low latency mobile augmented reality with flexible tracking,"Wenxiao Zhang, Bo Han, Pan Hui",2018/10/15,Book Proceedings of the 26th ACM international conference on Multimedia,"In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of Jaguar, a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) system that features accurate, low-latency, and large-scale object recognition and flexible, robust, and context-aware tracking. Jaguar pushes the limit of mobile AR's end-to-end latency by leveraging hardware acceleration with GPUs on edge cloud. Another distinctive aspect of Jaguar is that it seamlessly integrates marker-less object tracking offered by the recently released AR development tools (e.g., ARCore and ARKit) into its design. Indeed, some approaches used in Jaguar have been studied before in a standalone manner, e.g., it is known that cloud offloading can significantly decrease the computational latency of AR.

Efficient packet error rate estimation in wireless networks,"Bo Han, Seungjoon Lee",2007/5/21,Conference 2007 3rd International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructure for the Development of Networks and Communities,"Wireless links exhibit diverse link quality (e.g., in terms of error rate, latency, and required transmit power), and inferring the link cost correctly is crucial to finding an efficient path in multihop wireless networks. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating packet error rate (PER) in wireless networks. Most existing schemes use observed error rates of probe messages as representative packet error rates for wireless links. However, since typical data packets are larger than probe messages, the actual data packet error rate is often higher than the observed error rate of probe messages. Instead of directly using measurement statistics, our approach is to analyze them to determine the link characteristics and estimate the link quality (e.g., PER) based on the understanding. We describe a simple estimation scheme based on a well-known two-state Markov bit error model for wireless channels. We perform various …",50

However, the original algorithm neglects the possibility that the number of actively contending stations may change dynamically over time, leading to dynamically changing contention intensity. The major contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) we propose an accurate analytical model to analyze the performance of initial ranging requests in IEEE 802.16 networks. Two metrics, connection probability and average connection delay, are investigated to evaluate the network performance; 2) based on the above analysis, we propose an efficient performance improvement method by using dynamic window …",30

We demonstrate MetaPush is particularly suitable for cellular networks, providing negligible bandwidth overhead (around 0.4%), improved page load time (up to 45%), and reduced radio energy utilization (up to 37%) over HSPA+ networks.",28
Your friends have more friends than you do: Identifying influential mobile users through random-walk sampling,"Bo Han, Jian Li, Aravind Srinivasan",2013/9/13,Journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of identifying influential users in mobile social networks. Influential users are individuals with high centrality in their social-contact graphs. Traditional approaches find these users through centralized algorithms. However, the computational complexity of these algorithms is known to be very high, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. We propose a lightweight and distributed protocol, iWander, to identify influential users through fixed-length random-walk sampling. We prove that random-walk sampling with O(logn) steps, where n is the number of nodes in a graph, comes quite close to sampling vertices approximately according to their degrees. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to design a distributed protocol on mobile devices that leverages random walks for identifying influential users, although this technique has been used in other areas.

Implementation and Performance Evaluation of Fuzzy File Block Matching.,"Bo Han, Peter J Keleher",2007/6/17,Conference USENIX Annual Technical Conference,"The fuzzy file block matching technique (fuzzy matching for short), was first proposed for opportunistic use of Content Addressable Storage. Fuzzy matching aims to increase the hit ratio in the content-addressable storage providers, and thus can improve the performance of underlying distributed file storage systems by potentially saving significant network bandwidth and reducing file transmission costs. Fuzzy matching employs shingling to represent the fuzzy hashing of file blocks for similarity detection, and error-correcting information to reconstruct the canonical content of a file block from some similar blocks. In this paper, we present the implementation details of fuzzy matching and a very basic evaluation of its performance. In particular, we show that fuzzy matching can recover new versions of GNU Emacs source from older versions.",19
Channel access throttling for overlapping BSS management,"Bo Han, Lusheng Ji, Seungjoon Lee, Robert R Miller, Bobby Bhattacharjee",2009/6/14,Conference 2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications,"Multiple co-channel WLAN BSSes (i.e., WLAN cells) overlapping in coverage are generally considered undesirable because members of the OBSSes compete for channel access, which typically increases the contention level of wireless medium access and reduces overall system performance.

CAT provides an access point (AP) of each BSS with a mechanism to control channel access parameters of its member stations on the fly.

A general framework for efficient geographic routing in wireless networks,"Seungjoon Lee, Bobby Bhattacharjee, Suman Banerjee, Bo Han",2010/4/8,Journal Computer Networks,"We propose a new link metric called normalized advance (NADV) for geographic routing in multihop wireless networks.

Depending on the objective or message priority, applications can use the NADV framework to minimize various types of link cost. We present efficient methods for link cost estimation and perform detailed experiments in simulated environments. Our results show that NADV outperforms current schemes in many aspects: for example, in high noise environments with frequent packet losses, the use of NADV leads to 81% higher delivery ratio. When compared to centralized routing under certain settings, geographic routing using NADV finds paths whose cost is close to the optimum. We …",16

{YuZu}:{Neural-Enhanced} Volumetric Video Streaming,"Anlan Zhang, Chendong Wang, Bo Han, Feng Qian",2022,Conference 19th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 22),"Differing from traditional 2D videos, volumetric videos provide true 3D immersive viewing experiences and allow viewers to exercise six degree-of-freedom (6DoF) motion. However, streaming high-quality volumetric videos over the Internet is extremely bandwidth-consuming. In this paper, we propose to leverage 3D super resolution (SR) to drastically increase the visual quality of volumetric video streaming. To accomplish this goal, we conduct deep intra-and inter-frame optimizations for off-the-shelf 3D SR models, and achieve up to 542× speedup on SR inference without accuracy degradation. We also derive a first Quality of Experience (QoE) model for SR-enhanced volumetric video streaming, and validate it through extensive user studies involving 1,446 subjects, achieving a median QoE estimation error of 12.49%. We then integrate the above components, together with important features such as QoE-driven network/compute resource adaptation, into a holistic system called YuZu that performs line-rate (at 30+ FPS) adaptive SR for volumetric video streaming. Our evaluations show that YuZu can boost the QoE of volumetric video streaming by 37% to 178% compared to no SR, and outperform existing viewport-adaptive solutions by 101% to 175% on QoE.",8

Fras: Federated reinforcement learning empowered adaptive point cloud video streaming,"Yu Gao, Pengyuan Zhou, Zhi Liu, Bo Han, Pan Hui",2022/7/15,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.07394,"Point cloud video transmission is challenging due to high encoding/decoding complexity, high video bitrate, and low latency requirement. Consequently, conventional adaptive streaming methodologies often find themselves unsatisfactory to meet the requirements in threefold: 1) current algorithms reuse existing quality of experience (QoE) definitions while overlooking the unique features of point cloud video thus failing to provide optimal user experience, 2) most deep learning approaches require long-span data collections to learn sufficiently varied network conditions and result in long training period and capacity occupation, 3) cloud training approaches pose privacy risks caused by leakage of user reported service usage and networking conditions. To overcome the limitations, we present FRAS, the first federated reinforcement learning framework, to the best of our knowledge, for adaptive point cloud video streaming. We define a new QoE model which takes the unique features of point cloud video into account. Each client uses reinforcement learning (RL) to train encoding rate selection with the objective of optimizing the user's QoE under multiple constraints. Then, a federated learning framework is integrated with the RL algorithm to enhance training performance with privacy preservation. Extensive simulations using real point cloud videos and network traces reveal the superiority of the proposed scheme over baseline schemes.

It integrates the emerging AR development tools (e.g., ARCore and ARKit) into its client design for achieving flexible, robust and context-aware object tracking. Our prototype implementation of Jaguar reduces the end-to-end AR latency to ~33 ms and achieves accurate six degrees of freedom (6DoF) tracking. In this demo, we will show that our Jaguar client recognizes movie posters within the camera view by offloading computation intensive tasks to edge cloud and augments these posters with their movie trailers in 3D upon receiving the recognition results.",3
QoS in multi-hop wireless networks,"Lusheng Ji, Bo Han, II Robert R Miller",2013/7/9,Patent office US,"A path configuration message is sent to nodes in a multi-hop network along a path between a source node and destination nodes. The path configuration message includes path information and one or more special channel access parameters associated with the path information. The path configuration message temporarily changes the channel access priority for packets matching the path information in the special message. The nodes along the path therefore have higher channel access priority relative to other nearby nodes and other traffic flows. At the end of the a length of a time determined by a time to live parameter in the special message, the nodes resume using default channel access parameters in place of the special channel access parameters for packets matching the path information.",3
Don't love thy nearest neighbor.,"Cristian Lumezanu, Dave Levin, Bo Han, Neil Spring, Bobby Bhattacharjee",2010/4/27,Conference IPTPS,"One of the most flexible features of Internet routing—that service providers have administrative autonomy over their networks—has, over the years, proven to be one of the most restrictive—users have little to no say in how their packets are forwarded, nor what kind of quality of service they receive. As online services’ and users’ demands have evolved, the goals of Internet routing have broadened. For example, although ISPs engineer for high throughput, users often benefit from low-latency paths, as well [22]. Also, recent concerns over traffic shaping [10] have led to demands for net-neutral routing mechanisms that subvert ISPs’ routing policies [29]. Overlay routing systems [1, 22] address some of these concerns by allowing users to forward traffic through one another. Because they can choose the overlay path, users have some say in what path their packets take. An important primitive in overlay routing systems is node location: the ability to find nodes that satisfy latency constraints. For example, content distribution networks (CDNs)[11] and online games’ matchmaking services [7] are more efficient when performed through hosts that decrease delay to receivers [27, 15]. Network coordinates [9, 23] offer a practical and scalable solution to node location by assigning nodes position in a geometric space such that the distance between the positions estimates the real Internet latency. Viewing hosts as network coordinates, many complex routing queries can be rephrased as geometry problems [25]. For instance, the problem of finding a game server that minimizes the average latency to a set of players’ machines can be thought of as finding the game …",3

Fuzzy matching aims to increase the hit ratio in the content-addressable storage providers, and thus can improve the performance of underlying distributed file storage systems by potentially saving significant network bandwidth and reducing file transmission costs. Fuzzy matching employs shingling to represent the fuzzy hashing of file blocks for similarity detection, and error-correcting information to reconstruct the canonical content of a file block from some similar blocks. In this paper, we present the implementation details of fuzzy matching and a very basic evaluation of its performance. In particular, we show that fuzzy matching can recover new versions of GNU Emacs source from older versions.",

Windowed Black Box Model and Multiple Channels Test Method Applied in Routing Protocol Test,"Yixin Zhao Bo Han Xia Yin, Jianping Wu",2000,Journal Proc of APCC2000. Korea,"The protocol implementation was tested as black box before. Due to the complexity of routing protocols, the black box model can not fulfil the requirements to test them. Based on the analysis and perception of routing protocols, the windowed black box model is raised. The controllability and the observability are enhanced through other modules that interact with the module under test using standard interfaces. The multiple channels test method is put forward accordingly with more channels such as configuration channel and auxiliary information channel. The coverage and the efficiency of the test are increased considerably. With techniques like packet extension, the test suite is organized and described uniformly and integrally, which guarantees the flexibility and the universality and paves the way for the transition from single centered test suite to a distributed one. This model and this test method have achieved desirable results from routing protocol test and also give valuable references for the test of other protocols.",
Enabling Mobile Augmented and Virtual Reality with 5G Networks,"John Oetting, Bo Han, Claude Noshpitz","Though the underlying technology and concepts defining Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have been in development for decades, advancements in graphics, computing, sensors, and networking have finally placed this emerging industry on the cusp of mass-market adoption. As the supporting hardware and infrastructure continue to develop, immersive systems have the potential to inspire a multi-billion-dollar industry, and even be as game-changing as the advent of the PC. However, despite unprecedented development and investment in the past few years, the AR/VR industry is still facing the substantial difficulty of deploying high quality systems with the mobility and robust user-experience necessary pull this technology from the pages of science fiction into our mainstream reality.The challenges of delivering the wealth of rich and compelling experiences that will give this new medium an enduring reason to exist are decidedly nontrivial. Immersive and interactive graphical applications require extraordinary levels of computing power relative to traditional forms of media and interaction. Even the most superior mobile AR/VR hardware currently available is suffering from limited battery life, overheating, and insufficient computing capabilities–challenges that we believe will persist throughout the next decade. Mobile-driven AR/VR engineers are eager to harness the power of cloud computing and alleviate the strain placed on end user devices by offloading computationally-intensive tasks to powerful remote servers. However, they have thus far found network bandwidth and latency constraints to be prohibitive.","Scholar articles Enabling Mobile Augmented and Virtual Reality with 5G NetworksJ Oetting, B Han, C NoshpitzRelated articles All 2 versions ","Though the underlying technology and concepts defining Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have been in development for decades, advancements in graphics, computing, sensors, and networking have finally placed this emerging industry on the cusp of mass-market adoption.

Research Activities and Contributions,Bo Han,"My research efforts are primarily concentrated in two directions: measuring and improving 802.11 MAC protocols, and designing and analyzing algorithms and protocols for mobile wireless systems. My works at these two layers complement each other well; a deeper understanding of MAC layer protocols helps build efficient systems which in turn require enhancements or modifications at the low layer. Below, I discuss my research activities and contributions in more detail.Bit Error Patterns I constructed a number of 802.11 wireless LAN testbeds and conducted extensive experiments to investigate the characteristics of sub-frame bit errors and their location distribution. The measurement results identify three bit error patterns: the slope-line, saw-line and finger patterns. Among these three patterns, I have verified that the slope-line and saw-line patterns are present in 802.11 data transmissions in different physical environments and across different hardware platforms. The importance of this work is that identifying these error patterns can potentially introduce new opportunities in channel coding, forward error correction and frame combining mechanisms. This work appeared in INFOCOM 2009 and its extended version has been accepted by the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking [1].",Scholar articles Research Activities and ContributionsB HanRelated articles All 2 versions ,"My research efforts are primarily concentrated in two directions: measuring and improving 802.11 MAC protocols, and designing and analyzing algorithms and protocols for mobile wireless systems.
