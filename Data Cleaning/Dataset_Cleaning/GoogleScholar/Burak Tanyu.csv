This is a new paradigm for many in geotechnical engineering. Realising the potential of this paradigm requires a multidisciplinary approach that embraces biology and geochemistry to develop techniques for beneficial ground modification. This paper assesses the progress, opportunities, and challenges in this emerging field. Biomediated geochemical processes, which consist of a geochemical reaction regulated by subsurface microbiology, currently being explored include mineral precipitation, gas generation, biofilm formation and biopolymer generation. For each of these processes, subsurface microbial processes are employed to create an environment conducive to the desired geochemical reactions among the minerals, organic matter, pore fluids, and gases that constitute soil …",743

Microbial-induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) holds the potential for increasing the shear stiffness and reducing the hydraulic conductivity by harnessing a natural microbiological process that precipitates calcium carbonate. The study presented herein focuses on controlling MICP treatment of one-dimensional flow, half-meter-scale column experiments. Treatment was optimized by varying procedural parameters in five pairs of experiments including flow rates, flow direction, and formulations of biological and chemical amendments.

Review of remote sensing methodologies for pavement management and assessment,"E Schnebele, BF Tanyu, G Cervone, and N Waters",2015/6,Source European Transport Research Review,"Evaluating the condition of transportation infrastructure is an expensive, labor intensive, and time consuming process. Many traditional road evaluation methods utilize measurements taken in situ along with visual examinations and interpretations. The measurement of damage and deterioration is often qualitative and limited to point observations. Remote sensing techniques offer nondestructive methods for road condition assessment with large spatial coverage. These tools provide an opportunity for frequent, comprehensive, and quantitative surveys of transportation infrastructure.",172

Development of a scaled repeated five-spot treatment model for examining microbial induced calcite precipitation feasibility in field applications,"JT DeJong, BC Martinez, TR Ginn, C Hunt, D Major, B Tanyu",2014/5/1,Journal Geotechnical Testing Journal,"Microbial induced calcite precipitation (MICP) has been heavily investigated in laboratory experiments with few forays into field-scale implementation. Conventionally, MICP refers to an alternative technology for improving the geotechnical properties of soils via microbially mediated urea hydrolysis inducing conditions for calcite precipitation at particle contacts. The study presented herein focuses on up-scaling the conventional treatment process to more realistic volumes through the development of a scaled repeated five-spot treatment model. Commonly used in oil recovery applications, the repeated five-spot well pattern provides for a flow symmetry condition allowing for improved laboratory model feasibility. A conventional MICP two-phase treatment technique resulted in improvement in the target treatment (0.5 m by 0.5 m by 0.15 m) zone with small spatial variation. Sensors, including bender elements and sampling wells, provided valuable insight into the evolution of biological, chemical, and mechanical changes spatially and temporally during treatment. Overall, the scaled repeated five-spot treatment model was successful at capturing a complex treatment scenario involving a bio-mediated soil improvement technology and demonstrated the potential to capture complex scenarios of soil improvement.",61
Effects of extraction methods and factors on leaching of metals from recycled concrete aggregates,"Janile O Bestgen, Bora Cetin, Burak F Tanyu",2016/7,Journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Leaching of metals (calcium (Ca), chromium (Cr), copper, (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn)) of recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) were investigated with four different leachate extraction methods (batch water leach tests (WLTs), toxicity leaching procedure test (TCLP), synthetic precipitation leaching procedure test (SPLP), and pH-dependent leach tests). WLTs were also used to perform a parametric study to evaluate factors including (i) effects of reaction time, (ii) atmosphere, (iii) liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio, and (iv) particle size of RCA. The results from WLTs showed that reaction time and exposure to atmosphere had impact on leaching behavior of metals. An increase in L/S ratio decreased the effluent pH and all metal concentrations.

However, in recent years it is increasingly difficult to find locally available clay soils that satisfy the required engineering properties. Fine grained soils such as sepiolite and zeolite may be used as alternative materials in the constructions of landfill bottom liners. A study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using natural clay rich in kaolinite, sepiolite, zeolite, and their mixtures as a bottom liner material. Unconfined compression tests, swell tests, hydraulic conductivity tests, batch and column adsorption tests were performed on each type of soil and sepiolite–zeolite mixtures.

Contour Connection Method for automated identification and classification of landslide deposits,"Ben A Leshchinsky, Michael J Olsen, Burak F Tanyu",2015/1/1,Journal Computers & Geosciences,"Landslides are a common hazard worldwide that result in major economic, environmental and social impacts. Despite their devastating effects, inventorying existing landslides, often the regions at highest risk of reoccurrence, is challenging, time-consuming, and expensive. Current landslide mapping techniques include field inventorying, photogrammetric approaches, and use of bare-earth (BE) lidar digital terrain models (DTMs) to highlight regions of instability. However, many techniques do not have sufficient resolution, detail, and accuracy for mapping across landscape scale with the exception of using BE DTMs, which can reveal the landscape beneath vegetation and other obstructions, highlighting landslide features, including scarps, deposits, fans and more.

Comparison of laboratory resilient modulus with back-calculated elastic moduli from large-scale model experiments and FWD tests on granular materials,"BF Tanyu, WH Kim, TB Edil, CH Benson",2003/1,Journal ASTM Special Technical Publication,"A comparison is made between resilient moduli obtained from (i) a conventional small-scale resilient modulus test,(ii) a large-scale model experiment (LSME), and (iii) a falling weight deflectometer (FWD) in the field. The LSME is a large prototype-scale test simulating a pavement section. The FWD tests were conducted on a highway test section. All tests were conducted on a typical base course material and two granular industrial by-products used as subbase. Relationships between elastic modulus and bulk stress were derived from the LSME data by modeling the set-up as a nonlinear elastic layered system using the computer program KENLAYER. Elastic moduli were back-calculated from the FWD data using the program MODULUS. Reasonable correspondence between the elastic moduli measured at different scales was obtained when empirical corrections were made for strain amplitude using a backbone curve for granular materials and by matching stress levels. However, even when corrections are applied, the low-strain (or maximum) elastic modulus for the industrial byproducts inferred from the laboratory resilient modulus test tends to be lower (by a factor of 1.5 to 4) than the operative elastic modulus inferred from the LSME and the FWD tests. In addition, the minimum bulk stress provided by the laboratory resilient modulus test can be higher than the bulk stress existing in the field. In such cases, the elastic modulus at the field bulk stress can be estimated by extrapolation using a power function.",44

Impact of aging on leaching characteristics of recycled concrete aggregate,"Aiyoub Abbaspour, Burak F Tanyu, Bora Cetin",2016/10,Journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"The focus of this study was to evaluate the effects of stockpiling (aging) on leaching of elements in recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) that may contribute to tufaceous constituent formation. Speciation and leaching controlling mechanisms of these elements were identified via geochemical modeling. The effects of stockpiling were simulated by comparing freshly produced RCA with RCA aged as part of this study for 1 year both in the laboratory and in the field. Leachate samples were generated following batch water leach test (WLT) and US Geological Survey leach test (USGSLT) methods. USGSLTs were conducted both on the laboratory and field samples while WLT was only conducted on laboratory samples.

Equivalency of crushed rock and three industrial by-products used for working platforms during pavement construction,"Burak F Tanyu, Craig H Benson, Tuncer B Edil, Woon-Hyung Kim",2004,Journal Transportation Research Record,"A study was conducted to define an equivalency criterion for five materials used for working platforms during pavement construction on a poor subgrade: conventional crushed rock (referred to as breaker run) and four alternatives (Grade 2 gravel, foundry slag, bottom ash, and foundry sand). A layer of alternative material was considered equivalent if the total deflection of the alternative material was equal to that of breaker run under the same construction loading. Total deflection data for the equivalency assessment were obtained from a large-scale model experiment (LSME) simulating a prototype-scale pavement structure. Total deflections obtained from the LSME were checked against deflections measured in the field with a rolling wheel deflectometer and with an analytical method developed for unpaved roads.

Effect of particle shape on durability and performance of unbound aggregate base,"Clayton S Cook, Burak F Tanyu, Ali B Yavuz",2017/2/1,Journal Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering,"Effects of particle shape on the durability (as determined from micro-Deval test) and performance [as determined from resilient modulus (), and permanent deformation (PD) tests] of unbound aggregate base (UAB) used in road structures have been evaluated in detail. Four crushed aggregates with different mineralogy (but similar angularity) were selected, and each aggregate type was mixed based on varying particle shapes (ranging from flat to equidimensional) to create dense- and open-graded gradations. The findings showed that the increase in flatness ratio affects the compaction and interlocking characteristics of the open-graded UAB materials much more than the dense-graded UAB materials.

Optimizing the gradation of fine processed reclaimed asphalt pavement and aggregate blends for unbound base courses,"Saad Ullah, Burak F Tanyu, Edward J Hoppe",2018/12,Journal Transportation Research Record,"The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of changes in grain size distribution to the permanent deformation of two different fine processed reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) blended with base course virgin aggregate (VA). Grain size distribution of the RAP-VA blends were created following two different approaches. The first approach was based on mixing RAP and VA to have one grain size distribution, regardless of how much RAP was added to VA (here referred to as the engineered mixture design). The second approach was based on mixing RAP and VA with as-is gradation from the plants to proportions determined by weight and not controlling the outcome of the specific grain size of the mixture.

Methodology to evaluate hydraulic compatibility of geotextile and RCA in underdrain systems,"A Abbaspour, BF Tanyu, AH Aydilek, AY Dayioglu",2018/2,Journal Geosynthetics International,"Long-term filtration tests were conducted to assess the hydraulic compatibility of the recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) and nonwoven geotextile that is typically used in underdrains. The RCA samples used in this study were collected from a single facility, but with different ages (aged in the laboratory). Geotextile samples were also exhumed after each test and evaluated for reduction in their serviceability. The laboratory tests showed that aging does not adversely affect the hydraulic properties of the RCA in long-term filtration tests. The results showed that the previously defined serviceability criteria based on gradient and permeability ratios are not relevant to evaluate the hydraulic compatibility of RCA/geotextile tested in this study due to the existence of turbulent flow regime.

"Durability assessments of rare green andesites widely used as building stones in Buca (Izmir), Turkey","A Bahadır Yavuz, Sebahat Atay Kaputoglu, Mümtaz Çolak, Burak F Tanyu",2017/3,Journal Environmental earth sciences," Miocene volcanism was active in the city area of İzmir, Turkey, where volcanic deposits formed predominantly made of gray and pinkish colored andesite. These rocks have been widely used in the construction of many buildings in the region. In the northern part of Izmir, known as the Buca region, there is an area where andesite presents green color. The occurrence of the green andesite is rather rare, and historically this rock type has been used in the construction of ancient valuable architectonic structures including aqueducts, historical buildings, and mosques. Some of these structures date back to the beginning of the first century AD when the region was under the control of the Roman Empire.

Two methods are proposed. One method treats the working platform as a subbase layer and assigns a structural number to the working platform for use in computing the overall structural number of the pavement. The other method adjusts the effective roadbed modulus to account for the improvement in the roadbed provided by the working platform.

Contribution of geosynthetic reinforcement to granular layer stiffness,"Tuncer B Edil, Woon-Hyung Kim, Craig H Benson, Burak F Tanyu",2007,Book Soil and material inputs for mechanistic-empirical pavement design,This paper describes the contribution of geosynthetic reinforcement to improved stiffness of a granular layer originally constructed as a working platform but serves as a subbase layer after pavement structure is constructed. Large-scale model experiments were conducted that demonstrate the improved stiffness of granular layers reinforced with 4 types of geosyntetics. The load-elastic deflection data is analyzed by dividing the granular layer into sublayers including a reinforced sublayer with a thickness of 100 mm to isolate the effect of reinforcement on elastic modulus. The comparison of the elastic modulus parameter of this layer to that of the unreinforced sublayers indicate that there is an increase of 1.1 to 3.0 times in the elastic modulus depending on the type of geosynthetic. This improvement is also a function of the overall layer thickness because of the effect of shear strain amplitude that is not accounted for in …,14
Laboratory evaluation of governing mechanism of frictionally connected MSEW face and implications on design,"Moustafa I Awad, Burak F Tanyu",2014/10/1,Journal Geotextiles and Geomembranes,"This paper presents a laboratory evaluation of purely frictionally connected geotextile and concrete facing block of Mechanically Stabilized Earth Wall (MSEW) systems. The study focuses on investigating the governing failure mechanism along the wall face, as determined from the pullout of reinforcement in between the facing blocks (herein referred as pullout mechanism) and sliding of the blocks over the geotextile, where the reinforcement stays stationery (herein referred as direct shear mechanism). A total of seventy-two tests were performed to investigate the effect of laboratory specimen size, difference in geotextile reinforcement, and repeatability of the test results. Overall, the results showed that at lower normal loads, sliding of the blocks over the geotextile reinforcement along the wall face is more likely to occur before the pullout of the geotextile in between the blocks. At higher normal loads, this order is …",13
Development of a GIS-based failure investigation system for highway soil slopes,"Raghav Ramanathan, Ahmet H Aydilek, Burak F Tanyu",2015/6,Journal Frontiers of Earth Science,"A framework for preparation of an early warning system was developed for Maryland, using a GIS database and a collective overlay of maps that highlight highway slopes susceptible to soil slides or slope failures in advance through spatial and statistical analysis. Data for existing soil slope failures was collected from geotechnical reports and field visits. A total of 48 slope failures were recorded and analyzed. Six factors, including event precipitation, geological formation, land cover, slope history, slope angle, and elevation were considered to affect highway soil slope stability. The observed trends indicate that precipitation and poor surface or subsurface drainage conditions are principal factors causing slope failures. 96% of the failed slopes have an open drainage section. A majority of the failed slopes lie in regions with relatively high event precipitation (P>200 mm). 90% of the existing failures are surficial …",12
Evaluation of required connection load in GRS-IBS structures under service loads,"F Gebremariam, BF Tanyu, B Christopher, D Leshchinsky, JG Zornberg, J Han",2020/12,Journal Geosynthetics International,This study presents an evaluation of the connection load (To) and stress-strain conditions right behind the facing of a Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil – Integrated Bridge Structure (GRS-IBS) based on field instrumentation data obtained from an abutment constructed in Virginia. The observations from this site are compared against other projects in Delaware and Louisiana. The lateral stress distribution obtained from the field was observed to be lower than the active lateral earth pressure distribution but higher than predicted using the bin pressure method. The results from all sites showed that the reinforcement strains measured in the field were below the maximum geosynthetic strains allowed in the design of GRS-IBS. The distributions of both lateral stresses and reinforcement strains with depth were found to be approximately uniform. The To values for the Virginia structure were obtained based both on …,10
CO2 Sequestration by Carbonation Processes of Rubblized Concrete at Standard Conditions and the Related Mineral Stability Diagrams,"Aiyoub Abbaspour, Burak F Tanyu",2020/4/7,Journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering,"A study is conducted to evaluate the carbonation processes from rubblized concrete (RC) as it relates to CO2 sequestration and carbon life cycle analyses for cement and concrete industries. In a one-year time frame, this study demonstrated that, during direct carbonation, RC absorbs up to 56 mg/g of CO2 when pretreated (suitable for mineral carbonation technology - MCT) and 19 mg/g of CO2 when unprocessed (suitable to create RC beds). RC is also found to be able to absorb CO2 during the indirect carbonation process of MCT (including high ionic strength (IS ≈ 0.1 to 0.5 M) and CO2 injection into solution). This condition results in r = Ca2+/SO42– ≈ 1, which favors the precipitation of calcite. However, when RC is treated as a bed of material, the indirect process does not appear to favor the CO2 absorption as the solution becomes low ionic strength (IS ≈ 0.06 M) and the r values stay close to unity for the …",10

Proposed refinements to design procedures for geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS) structures in AASHTO LRFD bridge design specifications,"Jorge G Zornberg, Amr M Morsy, Behdad Mofarraj Kouchaki, Barry Christopher, Dov Leshchinsky, Jie Han, Burak F Tanyu, Fitsum T Gebremariam, Panpan Shen, Yan Jiang",2019,Source NCHRP Web-Only Document,"This document is an adaptation of Chapter 8 of the Contractor’s Final Report for NCHRP Project 24‐41,“Defining the Boundary Conditions for Composite Behavior of Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil Structures,” which discusses proposed design refinements for Section 11.10 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. It explores the effect of adopting a closely‐spaced reinforcement layout in geosynthetic‐reinforced soil structures. While research since the early 1980s has identified the beneficial effect of closely‐spaced reinforcement in reinforced soil structures, such improvement in performance is not accounted for in the simplified methodologies established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Considering the effect of closely‐spaced reinforcement may be particularly relevant in critical structures, such as load‐carrying geosynthetic‐reinforced MSE (GMSE) bridge abutments, which eliminate the use of deep foundations to support the bridge loads. In fact, the adoption of closely‐spaced reinforcement was identified as being particularly relevant for these type of structures, leading to specific design guidelines developed by FHWA for structures that became identified as Geosynthetic‐Reinforced Soil Integrated Bridge System, or GRS‐IBS.",10

"Tufa precipitation from Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) over geotextile: Mechanism, composition, and affecting parameters","Aiyoub Abbaspour, Burak F Tanyu",2019/1/30,Journal Construction and Building Materials,"One of the limiting factors of using RCA as a construction material has previously been related to the generated tufa despite its acceptable mechanical properties. Studies conducted in the mid-90s seem to overestimate the potential of such formations; whereas, more recent studies tend to underestimate such depositions from RCA. However, a comprehensive study to understand the chemical mechanisms and resulting chemical composition of pure RCA tufa had not been carried out. This paper discusses the results of an analytical study that combines both the findings from experimental and theoretical geochemistry to demonstrate the conditions that result in tufa precipitation, the associated mineral compositions, and what these differences in mineral compositions may mean for the construction.",9
Construction quality control of unbound base course using light weight deflectometer where reclaimed asphalt pavement aggregate is used as an example,"Emre Akmaz, Saad Ullah, Burak F Tanyu, Erol F Guler",2020/10,Journal Transportation Research Record,"Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is already being recycled as a construction and building material. One of the commonly considered applications is to create an unbound aggregate from this material. However, since the particles of RAP have binder coatings, traditional quality control procedures applied during construction such as use of a nuclear density gauge does not provide accurate results. Therefore there is a need to find another method that can be applied during construction to confirm that the placement in the field meets the design criteria. For this reason, in this study, the suitability of using light weight deflectometer (LWD) has been investigated. The presented methodology outlines how to implement the use of LWD to create a target modulus in the laboratory as part of design criteria and compare with the field measurements. In the field, depending on the thickness of the constructed aggregate layer …",8

The effects of this additional water in the base course is evaluated to understand the effects of water infiltration due to seasonal variation even after the base layer is constructed. Blends of virgin aggregate (VA) and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) were selected for this evaluation. The laboratory test results showed that the addition of water increases the permanent deformation and decreases resilient modulus (both adverse effects). However, samples with better drainage properties (i.e., RAP-VA blends) perform better than base course constructed with VA alone.",8
Numerical investigation of reinforced soil structures with GRS-IBS design features,"F Gebremariam, BF Tanyu, E Güler, GS Urgessa, P Shen",2021/2,Journal Geosynthetics International,"This paper focuses on investigation of the effects of the presence of a bearing bed and reinforced soil foundation (RSF), the vertical reinforcement spacing and reinforcement stiffness, and subgrade compressibility on design components, including the lateral displacement of facing, maximum tension in reinforcement (Tmax), connection strength (To), and differential settlement in reinforced soil structures reinforced with woven geotextile. The investigation was conducted through numerical simulation of reinforced soil structures using the finite element program Plaxis 2D under plain strain condition. The results from the numerical analyses showed that the vertical reinforcement spacing has more effect on the design components than the reinforcement stiffness. The effect of slab load in widely spaced structures showed that the Tmax decreased linearly with depth. However, for closely spaced structures with a bearing …",7

Stockpiling recycled concrete aggregate: changes in physical properties and leachate characteristics due to carbonation and aging,"Aiyoub Abbaspour, Burak F Tanyu, Bora Cetin, Michael C Brown",2016,Book Geo-Chicago 2016,"The produced recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) often is stockpiled at the facility at which is produced and is maintained for more than a year before the material is utilized. This time period is referred to as aging in this study and this article is describing a methodology developed to simulate aging of RCA under laboratory conditions and its effects on RCA’s physical properties and characteristics of leachate extracted following batch water leach tests. The laboratory aging tests were performed for a period of one year. When samples of aged and non-aged RCA were compared, it was observed that unlike aged RCA, non-aged RCA has a measurable plastic limit. This is attributed to the existence of un-hydrated cement paste, which hydrates with aging. The data showed that the changes in other physical properties and mortar content were negligible.

"Investigation of the quality of armour stones used in rubble mound breakwater in Güzelbahçe (İzmir), Turkey","Maazou H Aboubacar, A Bahadır Yavuz, Burak F Tanyu, Seher Aloğlu Sarı",2021/6,Journal Environmental Earth Sciences,The goal of the study was to investigate the quality of the four different types of rocks obtained from three different quarries used as armour stones at the Güzelbahçe (İzmir-Turkey) project and to compare the findings against the observed field performance (after being in service between 2015 and 2019). The intent was to demonstrate the importance of initial characterization of the rocks before they are selected to be used in a given project and to examine the suitability of the existing classification methods to properly capture the observed field performance of the stones that may have complex geological make-up. Classification of all of these stones were evaluated in great detail both based on CIRIA/CUR and RERS classification methods. The findings were then compared with the classifications based on durability assessments from laboratory tests. The results from these evaluations indicated that if the …,4

A geospatial framework to estimate depth of scour under buildings due to storm surge in coastal areas,"Mariamawit Borga, Burak F Tanyu, Celso M Ferreira, Juan L Garzon, Michael Onufrychuk",2017/7,Journal Natural Hazards,"Hurricanes and tropical storms represent one of the major hazards in coastal communities. Storm surge generated by strong winds and low pressure from these systems have the potential to bring extensive flooding in coastal areas. In many cases, the damage caused by the storm surge may exceed the damage from the wind resulting in the total collapse of buildings. Therefore, in coastal areas, one of the sources for major structural damage could be due to scour, where the soil below the building that serves as the foundation is swept away by the movement of the water. The existing methodologies to forecast hurricane flood damage do not differentiate between the different damage mechanisms (e.g., inundation vs. scour). Currently, there are no tools available that predominantly focus on forecasting scour-related damage for buildings. Such a tool could provide significant advantages for planning and/or …",3
Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) as an Unbound Base Course Material: A Mechanistic Design Approach Based on Multi-stage Repeated Load Triaxial Tests,"Saad Ullah, Burak F Tanyu, Andrew Dawson",2022/3/1,Journal Transportation Geotechnics,"Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and blends of RAP with virgin aggregate (VA) were characterized in this study to be utilized as base course aggregate. Multi-stage and single repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests were conducted in the laboratory to characterize the materials. The results from these tests were used to develop a mechanistic design approach that is suited not only for virgin but also for recycled materials that are prone to excessive plastic deformations under repeated loads. The design approach presented in this study allows the users to select different pavement structure configurations in terms of base course and HMA thicknesses, where the selected configuration can withstand the repeated loads without undergoing significant permanent strains.

Chemical clogging and geotextile serviceability in subdrains adjacent to recycled concrete,"A Abbaspour, BF Tanyu",2021/8,Journal Geosynthetics International,"The formation and deposition of tufa precipitate from the leachate of the recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) within fibers of a nonwoven geotextile, as can potentially occur in a transportation infrastructure drainage system, is simulated in a laboratory environment. Two sets of modified column tests were conducted in this study with cycles of wetting and drying for 1 year in order to study the rate of RCA tufa precipitation. Results of measured changes in the infiltration capacities showed that, even with precipitated tufa, the RCA/geotextile system serviceability remains similar to the virgin aggregate (VA)/geotextile system at the end of the 12-month testing. Evaluation of the deposited tufa precipitation within geotextile samples showed that RCA tufa is dominated by calcite and gypsum minerals. Estimated quantities of RCA tufa deposition by existing models developed for natural environments, showed that they either …",2
Evaluate Hydraulic Compatibility of Geotextile and RCA in Underdrain Systems Under Turbulent Flow Regime,"Aiyoub Abbaspour, Burak F Tanyu",2019,"Journal Houston, Texas, USA",A series of long-term filtration performance tests were conducted using gradient ratio (GR) test chambers on recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) and virgin aggregate (VA) with a nonwoven geotextile. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the filtration performance of RCA/nonwoven geotextile system and to understand the applicability of commonly used clogging criteria (developed for different material) to RCA and VA when the flow regime is shifted to the turbulent domain. The results showed that previously defined serviceability criteria known as gradient and permeability ratios (GR and KR) are only valid under laminar flow condition and not applicable to evaluate the hydraulic compatibility of RCA (or VA)/geotextile wherever the turbulent flow regime exists. An alternative limiting ratio called herein hydraulic conductivity ratio for long-term filtration tests (HCRLFT) is proposed and validated with test results for both RCA and VA An acceptance criterion of HCRLFT≤ 4 is suggested to assess the compatibility of RCA (or VA)/nonwoven geotextile systems.,2

Optimizing Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) Content in Unbound Base Aggregate,"Burak F Tanyu, Saad Ullah, Emre Akmaz",2021/8/1,Issue FHWA/VTRC 22-R9,"This report is written to summarize the findings of a study conducted by George Mason University’s (GMU) Sustainable Geo Infrastructure (SGI) Research group to evaluate the expansion of using reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and to optimize the RAP content in unbound base aggregate. The particular scope of the research presented in this report has been determined by the VTRC/VDOT team and included a laboratory and a field study. Prior to the initiation of the research, based on the conversations with Virginia’s road building industry it was determined that the research will focus on evaluating what is referred as “fine processed” RAP (100% of the particles finer than 1-inch). Virgin aggregate (VA) used in this study complied with the VDOT’s 21A gradation and contained geologically similar aggregate pieces (diabase). During the initial phase, based on the availability, samples of RAP from 14 different asphalt plants in Virginia were collected and characterized. The goal was to assess the similarities and differences between the RAP produced throughout the Commonwealth. The results showed that all RAP samples had similar grain size distribution and primarily contained pieces of aggregate that were of diabase origin. The binder (asphalt) content of the samples ranged from 4.4 to 6.1%. Based on this characterization, samples from three different plants that represented a low, medium, and high binder content RAP were selected for detailed evaluation. The ages of the collected RAP samples were not known and most likely varied. Laboratory evaluation focused on assessing the performance of the RAP-VA blends against the …",

Evaluation of Use of Crushed Hydraulic Cement Concrete (CHCC) as an Additive to Base Course/Subbase Material,"Burak F Tanyu, Aiyoub Abbaspour",2020/11/1,Issue FHWA/VTRC 21-R12,"All new pavement systems constructed under the jurisdiction of the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) require drainage systems. These drainage systems are constructed with perforated pipe and coarse aggregate that surrounds the pipe. Additionally, to separate the coarse aggregate from the base course and to create a filter, the drainage system also contains nonwoven geotextile that surrounds the coarse aggregate. Currently, the use of crushed hydraulic cement concrete (CHCC) as base course in new pavement systems is not allowed in VDOT projects because of the concerns associated with CHCC potentially clogging the geotextile of the drainage system to an extent that the serviceability of the filtration system is compromised. The basis of this concern is primarily due to the limited literature from the research conducted around the late 1990s. However, these studies are often inadequate in details and also present results that are contradictory and more importantly are not based on the specific geotextile used by VDOT. Recently due to the awareness of sustainable practices, there is interest throughout the US to recycle CHCC and use it as base course aggregate. If allowed, this practice would result in the CHCC or blends of CHCC/virgin aggregate (VA) to be in direct contact with the geotextile. Several of the VDOT district material engineers developed a research needs statement (RNS) to investigate the VDOT provision that limits the use of CHCC. The research described in this report was conducted based on that RNS to evaluate the suitability of placing CHCC produced with a gradation similar to the Virginia 21 base course …",
Three-Dimensional Numerical Analysis of Performance of a Geosynthetic-Reinforced Soil Pier,"Panpan Shen, Jie Han, Jorge G Zornberg, Burak F Tanyu, Dov Leshchinsky",2018,Conference Proceedings of GeoShanghai 2018 International Conference: Ground Improvement and Geosynthetics,"Geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS) consisting of closely spaced geosynthetic layers has been increasingly used to support bridges due to its rapid construction, low construction cost, and effectiveness in eliminating bump at the end of the bridges. GRS performance tests (also referred to as GRS mini-pier tests) were used to evaluate load-deformation behavior of a frictionally connected GRS mass to support a vertical load. Numerical analysis is an alternative approach to study the behavior of the GRS mass if the numerical model is well calibrated and/or validated. In this study, a three-dimensional numerical model was developed using FLAC3D, a finite difference method-based program. The Mohr-Coulomb model was used to describe the behavior of backfill soil. Geosynthetic reinforcement was modeled as a linearly elastic material using “geogrid” structural elements. Different interfaces were considered in …",
A permanent fill-in? Researchers test recycled concrete for MSE backfill,Burak Tanyu,2017/2,Journal Roads & Bridges,"Mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) technology has been used as a concept dating backing to the earliest days of human history, when people reinforced mud dwellings using sticks and branches. However, because MSE structures are constructed predominantly using backfill, and in some parts of the US finding the backfill material that meets necessary design requirements is a challenge, an alternative backfill produced from recycled materials, as opposed to natural aggregate, is an appealing idea. Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) produced from crushed concrete (eg, curb and gutters, rigid pavement surface, structural concrete from demolished buildings, hardened washout left over from recent construction) is one of the materials of interest. Benefits and areas of concern regarding RCA are addressed in this article, as the results of research conducted by George Mason University (GMU)'s Sustainable Geotransportation Infrastructure (SGI) Research Group are presented.",
Numerical Evaluation of Boundary Effects on the Interaction between Geosynthetic Reinforcement and Backfill,"Yan Jiang, Jie Han, Jorge G Zornberg, Dov Leshchinsky, Barry R Christopher, Burak F Tanyu",2017,Book Geotechnical Frontiers 2017,"Geosynthetics have been extensively used to reinforce soil structures, such as embankments, slopes, walls, foundations and roads. Proper evaluation of the interaction between geosynthetic reinforcement and backfill is important to understand the mechanisms of geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) structures. Pullout tests have proven to be an effective way to study such interaction. In a pullout test, a geosynthetic reinforcement layer is buried in backfill within a test box. Vertical pressure is applied on top of the backfill to simulate the normal stress on top of the geosynthetic reinforcement in a GRS structure. The geosynthetic reinforcement is then pulled out from the backfill through an opening in the front wall of the box. The pullout test results are influenced by boundary conditions due to the thickness of the backfill, as well as the roughness of the interface between the backfill and the walls of the pullout box.

Case Study: Stability of Two Horizontal to One Vertical Embankment,"BF Tanyu, W Neal, JP Seymour, DG Bodine, Ö Bozok",2011,Book Geo-Frontiers 2011: Advances in Geotechnical Engineering,"Approximately 12-m (40-ft) tall compacted clay embankment was constructed at a slope of 2 horizontal (H) to 1 vertical (V) and over time the surface (0.45 to 0.8 m (1.5 to 2.5 ft) deep) of the embankment side slopes experienced extensive sloughing. The sloughing was due to a decrease in soil shear strength primarily caused by an increase in water content. Originally, a solution was proposed to reconstruct the slopes to 3H:1V at great cost. After completing comprehensive engineering, cost and benefit analyses, the engineer and owner worked together to develop an alternate solution that included flattening portions of the slopes to 2.5H:1V, improving surface drainage, and implementing a long-term monitoring and maintenance program at approximately half the original cost. This paper evaluates the causes of the sloughing and demonstrates how the owner and engineer can work together to reach cost-effective …",
Design and Permitting of a FGD Landfill over an Existing Ash Reservoir,"Daniel G Bodine, Burak F Tanyu, Paul J Sabatini, Mohammad Ajlouni, Dana E Limes",2009,"Book Contemporary Topics in Ground Modification, Problem Soils, and Geo-Support","A large coal fired operating plant in the Ohio River Valley had a need to develop a disposal facility for residual waste from its newly installed Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) system. Siting studies were conducted resulting in the selection of a site located partially over an inactive fly ash reservoir (FAR 1) which was undergoing closure and partially over a remnant mine spoil disposal site. While the selected site would allow for environmental and operational advantages, significant engineering design and construction challenges had to be addressed. This paper provides information on the challenges that relate to the design and permitting of this residual waste landfill. Specific issues addressed include: (1) boundary issues (i.e., existing mining highwall, valley stream, and 45-m high dam); (2) potential for differential settlements of the foundation subsoils and effects on leachate collection and piping systems; (3 …",
Development of methodology to include the strength contribution of select subgade materials in pavement structure,"Craig H Benson, Tuncer Edil, Burak F Tanyu, Woon-Hyung Kim",2005,Publisher Wisconsin Highway Research Program,"This study was conducted to develop a methodology to incorporate the structural contribution of working platforms, including those constructed with industrial by-products, into the design of flexible pavements. Structural contribution of the working platform was quantified in terms of a structural number or an effective roadbed modulus. Resilient modulus obtained from large-scale model experiments(LSME) conducted on several working platform materials (i.e., crushed stone (referred to as ?breaker run?, Grade 2 granular backfill (referred to as Grade 2), foundry slag, foundry sand, and bottom ash) were used in the analysis. Design charts are presented that show the structural number or the roadbed modulus as a function of type of material and thickness of the working platform. Another study was conducted to evaluate the structural contribution of geosynthetic-reinforced granular layers that are used as working platforms to the pavement structure. Based on the LSME and from the field Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) tests, the relationship between back-calculated elastic modulus and bulk stress was obtained. The improvement in layer coefficients is rather small for the nonwoven geotextile and drainage geocomposite (10%) and somewhat higher for the geogrid (40%) and for the woven geotextile (18%) in a 0.30-m thick granular working platform layer (treated as a subbase). The contribution of geosynthetics would be even less having a thicker subbase layer.",
"Modulus Testing for Pavement Components, ASTM STP 1437, GN Durham, WA Marr, and WL De Groff, Eds., ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2003.","BF Tanyu, WH Kim, TB Edil, CH Benson",2003,Journal Resilient Modulus Testing for Pavement Components,"A comparison is made between resilient moduli obtained from (i) a conventional small-scale resilient modulus test,(ii) a large-scale model experiment (LSME), and (iii) a falling weight deflectometer (FWD) in the field. The LSME is a large prototype-scale test simulating a pavement section. The FWD tests were conducted on a highway test section. All tests were conducted on a typical base course material and two granular industrial by-products used as subbase. Relationships between elastic modulus and bulk stress were derived from the LSME data by modeling the set-up as a nonlinear elastic layered system using the computer program KENLAYER. Elastic moduli were back-calculated from the FWD data using the prograrn MODULUS. Reasonable correspondence between the elastic moduli measured at different scales was obtained when empirical corrections were made for strain amplitude using a backbone curve for granular materials and by matching stress levels. However, even when corrections are applied, the low-strain (or maximum) elastic modulus for the industrial byproducts inferred from the laboratory resilient modulus test tends to be lower (by a factor of 1.5 to 4) than the operative elastic modulus inferred from the LSME and the FWD tests. In addition, the minimum bulk stress provided by the laboratory resilient modulus test can be higher than the bulk stress existing in the field. In such cases, the elastic modulus at the field bulk stress can be estimated by extrapolation using a power function.",

All test sections were designed to have approximately the same structural number as the conventional pavement structure used for the highway, which included a subbase of granular excavated rock. Observations made during and after construction indicated that all sections provided adequate support for the construction equipment and no distress was evident in any part of the highway. Each of the alternative stabilization methods, except a subbase prepared with foundry sand, appear to provide equivalent or greater stiffness than that provided by control sections constructed with excavated rock. However, the foundry sand subbase is providing adequate support. Analysis of leachate collected from the base of the test sections shows that the by-products discharge contaminants of concern at very low concentrations.",
Effects of field stockpiling on leaching calcareous constituents from recycled concrete aggregate to be used as unbound base course/subbase material,"Aiyoub Abbaspour, Burak TANYU",Journal of Innovative Transportation,Volume 1,"Understanding the potential of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) to precipitate calcareous constituents requires investigating the changes in solid and liquid chemistry of material throughout its service life including the stockpiling period. This study focuses on stockpiling freshly produced RCA in the field and monitoring the changes in concentrations of calcium and sulfur (as dominant ions), as well as pH, total dissolved solids, and carbonate content for about two years. The results showed that the carbonate content of solid particles increases with time, which causes a noticeable reduction in total dissolved solids in the leachate. Aging also slightly decreases the pH; however, this decrease is very slow. The leached concentration of calcium showed a noticeable reduction with aging, indicating the effect of the formation of secondary carbonated minerals with lower solubility than calcium hydroxide and calcium-silicate-hydrate. On the contrary, sulfur (S) release (which is leached as sulfate ion) showed little effect of aging and carbonation process on the long-term leaching of S. The results obtained from the aging of the field RCA pile created in this study were also compared with the previously published laboratory aging of RCA and the comparison provided evidence supporting the field observations.",
