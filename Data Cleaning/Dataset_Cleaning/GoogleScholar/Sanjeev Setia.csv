LEAP+ Efficient security mechanisms for large-scale distributed sensor networks,"Sencun Zhu, Sanjeev Setia, Sushil Jajodia",2006/11/1,Journal ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN),"We describe LEAP+ (Localized Encryption and Authentication Protocol), a key management protocol for sensor networks that is designed to support in-network processing, while at the same time restricting the security impact of a node compromise to the immediate network neighborhood of the compromised node. The design of the protocol is motivated by the observation that different types of messages exchanged between sensor nodes have different security requirements, and that a single keying mechanism is not suitable for meeting these different security requirements. LEAP+ supports the establishment of four types of keys for each sensor node: an individual key shared with the base station, a pairwise key shared with another sensor node, a cluster key shared with multiple neighboring nodes, and a global key shared by all the nodes in the network. LEAP+ also supports (weak) local source authentication …",2697
An interleaved hop-by-hop authentication scheme for filtering of injected false data in sensor networks,"Sencun Zhu, Sanjeev Setia, Sushil Jajodia, Peng Ning",2004/5/12,"Conference IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2004. Proceedings. 2004","Sensor networks are often deployed in unattended environments, thus leaving these networks vulnerable to false data injection attacks in which an adversary injects false data into the network with the goal of deceiving the base station or depleting the resources of the relaying nodes. Standard authentication mechanisms cannot prevent this attack if the adversary has compromised one or a small number of sensor nodes. In this paper, we present an interleaved hop-by-hop authentication scheme that guarantees that the base station will detect any injected false data packets when no more than a certain number t nodes are compromised. Further, our scheme provides an upper bound B for the number of hops that a false data packet could be forwarded before it is detected and dropped, given that there are up to t colluding compromised nodes. We show that in the worst case B is O(t/sup 2/). Through performance …",817
Establishing pairwise keys for secure communication in ad hoc networks: A probabilistic approach,"Sencun Zhu, Shouhuai Xu, Sanjeev Setia, Sushil Jajodia",2003/11/4,"Conference 11th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, 2003. Proceedings.","A prerequisite for a secure communication between two nodes in an ad hoc network is that the nodes share a key to bootstrap their trust relationship. In this paper, we present a scalable and distributed protocol that enables two nodes to establish a pairwise shared key on the fly, without requiring the use of any on-line key distribution center. The design of our protocol is based on a novel combination of two techniques - probabilistic key sharing and threshold secret sharing. Our protocol is scalable since every node only needs to possess a small number of keys, independent of the network size, and it is computationally efficient because it only relies on symmetric key cryptography based operations. We show that a pairwise key established between two nodes using our protocol is secure against a collusion attack by up to a certain number of compromised nodes.

Kronos: A scalable group re-keying approach for secure multicast,"Sanjeev Setia, Samir Koussih, Sushil Jajodia, Eric Harder",2000/5/14,Conference Proceeding 2000 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. S&P 2000,"The authors describe a novel approach to scalable group re-keying for secure multicast. Our approach, which we call Kronos, is based upon the idea of periodic group re-keying. We first motivate our approach by showing that if a group is re-keyed on each membership change, as the size of the group increases and/or the rate at which members leave and join the group increases, the frequency of rekeying becomes the primary bottle neck for scalable group re-keying. In contrast, Kronos can scale to handle large and dynamic groups because the frequency of re-keying is independent of the size and membership dynamics of the group. Next, we describe how Kronos can be used in conjunction with distributed key management frameworks such as IGKMP (T. Hardjono et al., 1998) that use a single group-wide session key for encrypting communications between members of the group. Using a detailed simulation, we …",405
LHAP: a lightweight hop-by-hop authentication protocol for ad-hoc networks,"Sencun Zhu, Shouhuai Xu, Sanjeev Setia, Sushil Jajodia",2003/5/19,"Conference 23rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, 2003.

To thwart or prevent such attacks, it is necessary to employ authentication mechanisms that ensure that only authorized nodes can inject traffic into the network. In this paper we present LHAP a scalable and light-weight authentication protocol for ad hoc networks. LHAP is based on two techniques: (i) hop-by-hop authentication for verifying the authenticity of all the packets transmitted in the network and (ii) one-way key chain and TESLA for packet authentication and for reducing the overhead for establishing trust among nodes. We analyze the security of LHAP and show LHAP is a lightweight security protocol through detailed performance analysis.",206
Secure data aggregation in wireless sensor networks,"Sankardas Roy, Mauro Conti, Sanjeev Setia, Sushil Jajodia",2012/3/2,Journal IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,"In a large sensor network, in-network data aggregation significantly reduces the amount of communication and energy consumption.

However, this aggregation framework does not address the problem of false subaggregate values contributed by compromised nodes resulting in large errors in the aggregate computed at the base station, which is the root node in the aggregation hierarchy. This is an important problem since sensor networks are highly vulnerable to node compromises due to the unattended nature of sensor nodes and the lack of tamper-resistant hardware.",195

This provides an estimate of the opportunity for hosting guest data. Second, how much memory can be expected to be idle on individual workstations? This helps determine the recruitment policy-how much memory should be recruited on individual hosts? Third, what is the distribution of memory idle-times? This indicates how long guest data can be expected to survive; applications that access their data-sets frequently within the expected life-time of guest data are more likely to benefit from exploiting idle memory.

GKMPAN: An efficient group rekeying scheme for secure multicast in ad-hoc networks,"Sencun Zhu, Sanjeev Setia, Shouhuai Xu, Sushil Jajodia",2006/1/1,Journal Journal of Computer Security,"We present GKMPAN, an efficient and scalable group rekeying protocol for secure multicast in ad hoc networks. Our protocol exploits the property of ad hoc networks that each member of a group is both a host and a router, and distributes the group key to member nodes via a secure hop-by-hop propagation scheme. A probabilistic scheme based on pre-deployed symmetric keys is used for implementing secure channels between members for group key distribution. GKMPAN also includes a novel distributed scheme for efficiently updating the pre-deployed keys. GKMPAN has three attractive properties. First, it is significantly more efficient than group rekeying schemes that were adapted from those proposed for wired networks. Second, GKMPAN has the property of partial statelessness; that is, a node can decode the current group key even if it has missed a certain number of previous group rekeying operations. This …",153

CORD: Energy-efficient reliable bulk data dissemination in sensor networks,"Leijun Huang, Sanjeev Setia",2008/4/13,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2008-The 27th Conference on Computer Communications,"This paper presents CORD, a reliable bulk data dissemination protocol for propagating a large data object to all the nodes in a large scale sensor network. Unlike well- known reliable data dissemination protocols such as Deluge whose primary design criterion is to reduce the latency of object propagation, CORD's primary goal is to minimize energy consumption. To achieve its goals CORD employs a two phase approach in which the object is delivered to a subset of nodes in the network that form a connected dominating set in the first phase, and to the remaining nodes in the second phase. Further, CORD installs a coordinated sleep schedule on the nodes in the network whereby nodes that are not involved in receiving or transmitting data can turn off their radios to reduce their energy consumption.

Analysis of the periodic update write policy for disk cache,"Scott D Carson, Sanjeev Setia",1992/1/1,Journal system,"A disk cache is typically used in ﬁle systems to reduce average access time for data storage and retrieval. The “periodic update” write policy, widely used in existing computer systems, is one in which dirty cache blocks are written to a disk on a periodic basis. In this paper we determine the average response time for disk read requests when the periodic update write policy is used. Read and write load, cache-hit ratio, and the disk scheduler’s ability to reduce service time under load are incorporated in the analysis, leading to design criteria that can be used to decide among competing cache write policies. The main conclusion of this paper is that the bulk arrivals generated by the periodic update policy cause a “trafﬁc jam” effect which results in severely degraded service.

DyRecT provides a high-level API that can be used for writing adaptive parallel HPF-like programs while hiding most of the details of the dynamic reconfiguration from the programmer. In addition, DyRecT provides support for making a wider variety of applications adaptive by exposing to the programmer a low-level library that implements many of the typical tasks performed during reconfiguration. We present experimental results for the overhead of dynamic reconfiguration of several benchmark applications using DyRecT.",20

Providing witness anonymity in peer-to-peer systems,"Bo Zhu, Sanjeev Setia, Sushil Jajodia",2006/10/30,Book Proceedings of the 13th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,"In this paper, we introduce the concept of witness anonymity for peer-to-peer systems. Witness anonymity combines the seemingly conflicting requirements of anonymity (for honest peers who report on the misbehavior of other peers) and accountability (for malicious peers that attempt to misuse the anonymity feature to slander honest peers). We propose the Secure Deep Throat (SDT) protocol to provide anonymity for witnesses of malicious or selfish behavior to enable such peers to report on this behavior without fear of retaliation. On the other hand, in SDT the misuse of anonymity is restrained in such a way that any malicious peer that attempts to send multiple claims against the same innocent peer for the same reason (i.e., the same misbehavior type) can be identified. We also describe how SDT can be used in two modes. The active mode can be used in scenarios with real-time requirements, e.g., detecting and …",15

Design and implementation of a parallel solution to the cutting stock problem,"Lisa D Nicklas, Robert W Atkins, Sanjeev K Setia, Pearl Y Wang",1998/8/25,Journal Concurrency: Practice and Experience,"The constrained 2D cutting stock problem is an irregular problem with dynamic data structures, highly variable amounts of computation per task, and unpredictable amounts and patterns of communication. This paper describes the design and implementation of a parallel solution to this problem on a cluster of workstations and a distributed memory multicomputer. The key element of our parallel solution is the replication of an important data structure on all processors. By exploiting properties of the cutting stock problem which allow the use of relaxed consistency mechanisms, our approach is able to reduce the overheads for communication and synchronization in comparison to approaches that partition the data structure among processors. A token‐based lazy release consistency protocol is used to ensure mutual exclusion and maintain consistency, and a randomized work‐stealing protocol is employed to …",14
The utility of exploiting idle memory for data-intensive computations,"Anurag Acharya, Sanjeev Setia",1998/2,Journal ACM SIGMETRICS,"In this paper, we examine the utility of exploiting idle memory in workstation pools. We attempt to answer the following questions. First, given a workstation pool, what fraction of the memory can be expected to be idle? This provides an estimate of the opportunity for hosting guest data. Second, what fraction of a individual host's memory can be expected to be idle? This helps determine the recruitment policy–what is the maximum amount of memory that should be recruited on a single host? Third, what is the distribution of memory idle-times? That is, what is the probability that a chunk of memory that is currently idle will be idle for longer than time t? This information indicates how long guest data can be expected to survive; applications that access their data-sets frequently within the expected life-time of guest data are more likely to benefit from exploiting idle memory. Fourth, how much benefit can a user expect? We use two metrics for the benefit of exploiting idle memory:(1) if I have a pool with w workstations, how much memory should I expect to get for free by harvesting idle memory;(2) how much improvement can be achieved in end-to-end execution time? Finally, how long and how frequently might a user have to wait to reclaim her machine if she volunteers to host guest pages on her machine? This helps answer the question of social acceptability. To answer the questions relating to the availability of idle memory, we have analyzed two-week long traces from five workstation pools with different sizes, locations, and patterns of use. To evaluate the expected benefits and costs, we have simulated three data-intensive applications (0.5 GB-5 GB …",14

To meet the severe energy constraints in WSNs, several researchers have proposed to use the in-network data aggregation technique (i.e., combining partial results at intermediate nodes during message routing), which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Given the lack of hardware support for tamper-resistance and the unattended nature of sensor nodes, sensor network protocols need to be designed with security in mind. Recently, researchers proposed algorithms for securely computing a few aggregates, such as Sum (the sum of the sensed values), Count (number of nodes) and Average.

"Scheduling on multiprogrammed, distributed memory parallel computers.",Sanjeev Kumar Setia,1994,Pages 5268-5268,"Multicomputers, consisting of a large number of processors interconnected by a high-speed network, are rapidly becoming an important platform for a large body of scientific computations. While the raison d''etre of multicomputers is to provide high performance to individual applications, cost and efficiency considerations make it necessary to share these systems among multiple applications. Multicomputers have traditionally space-shared the system processors among multiple programs using a static partitioning policy. In this dissertation, we present alternative strategies for scheduling multiple programs on multicomputers and show that they result in improved system throughput and utilization in comparison to existing policies.",11

A fair locking protocol for multilevel secure databases,"Sushil Jajodia, Luigi Mancini, Sanjeev Setia",1998/6/11,Conference Proceedings. 11th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop (Cat. No. 98TB100238),"Most concurrency control algorithms for multilevel secure databases based on kernelized architecture prevent covert channels between transactions at different security levels by preempting the high security transaction in the event of a data conflict with a lower security transaction.

We examine this problem of unfairness in concurrency control mechanisms for secure databases. Based on an analysis of the performance of a secure version of two phase locking, we propose three different modifications to the protocol that address the problem of starvation of high security transactions. Through a detailed simulation study, we examine the fairness and performance of these approaches for a variety of workloads.",5

In Ã¢ â¬ ÅtraditionalÃ¢ â¬ Â programming courses, instructors spend most of their time lecturing to large groups of students, with little class time to spend on active exercises or personal interaction. Students are not in control of the content delivery or its pacing, nor is it effectively communicated that practice is needed to master programming. Moreover, most practice is individual and graded strictly, meaning students suffer heavy penalties for minor slips while learning or collaborating. This past year we experimented with a self-paced version of introductory programming, where students spend class time working on problems in small groups at their own pace. Learning is intentional because students take responsibility for their learning, rather than waiting for the instructor. Our pass rates in the course improved by 25% with these modifications. This design could be adapted to other disciplines.

LEAP: Efficient Security Mechanisms for Large-Scale,Sanjeev Setia,2003,"Journal Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security: CCS 2003: October 27-31, 2003, Washington, DC, USA","In this paper, we describe LEAP (Localized Encryption and Authentication Protocol), a key management protocol for sensor networks that is designed to support in-network pro-cessing, while at the same time restricting the security impact of a node compromise to the immediate network neigh-borhood of the compromised node. The design of the pro-tocol is motivated by the observation that different types of messages exchanged between sensor nodes have different security requirements, and that a single keying mechanism is not suitable for meeting these different security require-ments. LEAP supports the establishment of four types of keys for each sensor node an individual key shared with the base station, a pairwise key shared with another sensor node, a cluster key shared with multiple neighboring nodes, and a group key that is shared by all the nodes in the net-work. The protocol used for establishing and updating these keys is communication-and energy-efficient, and minimizes the involvement of the base station. LEAP also includes an efficient protocol for inter-node traffic authentication based on the use of one-way key chains. A salient feature of the authentication protocol is that it supports source authentication without precluding in-network processing and passive participation. We analyze the performance and the secu-rity of our scheme under various attack models and show our schemes are very efficient in defending against many at-tacks.",

The performance of the networking facilities affects the performance of many computer applications. In the last decade, there has been a wealth of literature published on the performance of local area networks. The performance of LANs can be studied in various ways through analytic techniques, simulation techniques and through actual performance measurement. In this paper, we describe some of the analytic models that have been developed for LANs and discuss some experimental studies that have measured the performance of LANs. Local area networks can be modeled at various levels at the media access control (MAC) layer or at higher levels such as the LLC layer or the transport layer. For performance from the user point of view, models have been developed as an hierarchical description based on the layered architecture. Section 2 describes such an analytical model of a LAN in which multiple OSI layers have been combined together.

High Performance DBMS and Information Retrieval Systems,"David Grossman, Ophir Frieder, Sanjeev Setia","We have conducted a survey of current parallel DBMS and IR systems with a focus on systems that are capable of processing extremely large volumes of data with good response time. Where possible, we have identi ed academic literature that describes the inner workings of each product we have surveyed. In addition to identifying traditional DBMS and IR systems, we have also reviewed products and other solutions that make it possible to integrate both structured and unstructured data.We have tried to stay within the realm of products that support industry and de facto standards such as SQL and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) to maintain some level of technology independence. This will make it possible to quickly adapt our suggested solution to new parallel architectures. Based on our preliminary survey, we recommend construction of a prototype that would include Oracle to access structured data and UniSQL to access unstructured data. Since Oracle currently runs on a variety of parallel architectures and is an extremely stable vendor it is a solid choice for the development of a prototype. However, it is clear that unstructured","Scholar articles High Performance DBMS and Information Retrieval SystemsD Grossman, O Frieder, S SetiaRelated articles All 2 versions ","We have conducted a survey of current parallel DBMS and IR systems with a focus on systems that are capable of processing extremely large volumes of data with good response time.

The past few years have seen significant increase in cyber attacks on the Internet, resulting in degraded confidence and trusts in the use of Internet and computer systems. There is an increasing demand for measures to guarantee the privacy, integrity, and availability of resources in distributed systems, such as Grid and P2P systems. The attacks, including DDoS, email virus, and worms, are getting more sophisticated, spreading faster, and causing more damages. The attacks originally exploited the weakness of the individual protocols and operating systems, but now also have started to attack the basic infrastructure of the Internet.
