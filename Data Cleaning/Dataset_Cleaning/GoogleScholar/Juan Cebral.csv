The result of this work suggests that at the center of aneurysm evolution there is a cycle of wall degeneration and weakening in response to changing hemodynamic loading and biomechanic stress. This progressive wall degradation drives the geometrical evolution of the aneurysm until it stabilizes or ruptures. Risk factors such as location, genetics, smoking, co-morbidities, and hypertension seem to affect different components of this cycle. However, details of these interactions or their relative importance are still not clearly understood.",136

Morphological characterization of intracranial aneurysms using 3-D moment invariants,"Raul Daniel Millan, Laura Dempere-Marco, Jose M Pozo, Juan R Cebral, Alejandro F Frangi",2007/9/4,Journal IEEE transactions on medical imaging,"Rupture of intracranial saccular aneurysms is the most common cause of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, which has significant morbidity and mortality. Although there is still controversy regarding the decision on which unruptured aneurysms should be treated, this is based primarily on their size. Nonetheless, many large lesions do not rupture whereas some small ones do. It is commonly accepted that hemodynamical factors are important to better understand the natural history of cerebral aneurysms. However, it might not always be practical to carry out a detailed computational analysis of such factors if a prompt assessment is required. Since shape is likely to be dependent on the balance between hemodynamic forces and the aneurysmal surrounding environment, an appropriate morphological 3-D characterization is likely to provide a practical surrogate to quickly evaluate the risk of rupture.

The basis of the method is that object surfaces are represented as the zero-level iso-surface of the distance-to-surface function defined on a background grid. Thus, the triangulation of intersecting objects reduces to the extraction of an iso-surface from an unstructured grid. In a first step, a regular background mesh is constructed. For each point of the background grid, the closest distance to the surface of each object is computed. Background points are then classified as external or internal by checking the direction of the surface normal at the closest location and assigned a positive or negative distance, respectively. Finally, the zero-level iso-surface is constructed. This is the final triangulation of the intersecting objects. The overall …",83

Recent studies link the existence of vortices in the blood flow pattern to aneurysm rupture and report observations of embedded vortices - a larger vortex encloses a smaller one flowing in the opposite direction - whose implications are unclear. We present a clustering-based approach for the visual analysis of vortical flow in simulated cerebral aneurysm hemodynamics. We show how embedded vortices develop at saddle-node bifurcations on vortex core lines and convey the participating flow at full manifestation of the vortex by a fast and smart grouping of streamlines and the visualization of group …",43
Advances in FEFLO,Rainald Lohner,2002,Book 51st AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting including the New Horizons Forum and Aerospace Exposition,"This paper summarizes the major improvements and developments that have taken place during the last year for FEFLO, a general-purpose CFD code based on adaptive, unstructured grids. All aspects of a comprehensive simulation pipeline: pre-processing, gridding, field solvers and post-processing saw important advances, and are treated. The advent of machines with millions of cores focused a lot of the developments on distributed memory aspects of field solvers and multiphysics modules. Parallel grid generation, particles and flow, parallel interpolation, parallel domain splitting and repartitioning for multiphysics were all considered. Furthermore, timings on Xeon and AMD chips led to the realization that memory transfers play a considerable role as compared to floating point operations, something previous chip generations did not exhibit.

An implicit monolithic time accurate finite element scheme for incompressible flow problems,"O Soto, R Löhner, J Cebral",2001/6,Book 15th AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Conference,"The objective of this paper is to develop an implicit, monolithic, finite element (FE) scheme for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. The design of the method is based on the pressure stability properties of an implicit second order in time fractional step (FS) method, which is conditionally stable. The final monolithic scheme preserves the second order accuracy of the FS method, and it is unconditionally stable (ie stable for all timestep sizes). In addition, it is shown that the final pressure stabilizing term is practically the same fourth order pressure term added by some authors, but following different arguments, to obtain high order accurate results. It is also shown that the final stabilized convective term is a formally second order discretization of the advective operator.

Computer simulation of cerebral artery clipping: relevance to aneurysm neuro-surgery planning,"Juan R Cebral, R Lohner, James E Burgess",2000/9/11,Journal Proc. ECCOMAS,"This paper presents some recent developments in the CFD simulation technology in order to implement computational tools that can be used for planning neuro-surgical and interventional procedures on a patient-specific basis. Accurate anatomical modeling is carried out by integrating several image processing operators, geometry modeling algorithms and unstructured grid generation techniques over discretely defined surfaces. The flow solutions are obtained using a finite element flow solver based on a pressure correction scheme. Different physiological boundary conditions are prescribed depending on the available physiological data. In particular, when no flow information is available for outflow boundaries, a vascular bed model is adopted in order to impose pressure boundary conditions. The predictive power of the numerical modeling of blood flow is demonstrated in two patient specific cases taken from MRA images. Specifically, the redistribution of blood flow in the circle of Willis during an occlusive surgical maneuver typically performed for aneurysm clipping is analyzed. New visualization techniques specifically designed for flows in branching tubes of non-uniform cross sections are illustrated.",38

The image is composed of vertex points, each vertex point having a discrete point identifier and three dimensional position information. The three dimensional position information is averaged in a shrinking procedure to contract the three dimensional image proximate to a major axis of the colon-like surface. Evenly spaced points are taken through the shrunken colon like surface and connected to form a curve. Planes are generated at intervals normal to the curve to split the shrunken colon like surface into image segments. By mapping these image segments back to the original image through their discrete point identifiers, an accurate ring profile of the colon like surface can be generated.",14

In particular, the interaction between haemodynamical forces and arterial wall biology is believed to play an important role in the formation, growth and, eventually, rupture of intracranial aneurysms. Due to the absence of ground truth image modalities to measure blood flow, image-based haemodynamics simulation represents an attractive tool to provide insight into the haemodynamics characteristics of intracranial aneurysms.

Changes in cerebral aneurysm hemodynamics after virtual endarterectomy,"Marcelo A Castro, Nora L Peloc, Christopher Putman, Juan R Cebral",2012,Journal Mecánica Computacional,"Cerebral aneurysm hemodynamics depends on flow conditions at and geometry of parent vessels. Wall shear stress distributions and extreme values are widely accepted to be responsible for aneurysm initiation, growth and rupture. Those aneurysms may coexist with a proximal artery stenosis in a small number of patients. In those cases, that poses a challenge for interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons to make the best treatment decision. For low and mild stenoses, flow alterations in the aneurysm sacs are limited when the aneurysm is located far downstream in the same circulation. However, for distal aneurysms close to the stenosis, intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics may be significantly affected by the stenosis. In this work we studied the changes in the wall shear stress distributions after virtual intervention in both ideal and patient-specific models. Three-dimensional rotational angiographic images were segmented using region growing and deformable model algorithms. Isosurface of the boundary was used to generate a volumetric mesh of tetrahedra in the domain using an advancing front technique. Numerical integration of the Navier-Stoke's equations was performed using a time dependent finite element formulation. Personalized inflow wave forms were imposed at the inlets and hemodynamic forces were studied at the systolic peak.

Effects of foreshortening and oversizing of flow diverting stents for intracranial aneurysms,"Fernando Mut, Rainald Löhner, Christopher M Putman, Juan R Cebral",2010,Journal Mecánica Computacional,"Understanding the effects of flow diverting stents is important to evaluate and plan treatments, identify possible failure modes and limitations, and improve the design of flow diverting devices. The purpose of this work was to develop methods for precise deployment of flow diverting stent models into patient-specific vascular geometries reconstructed from three-dimensional (3D) anatomical images of brain aneurysms. The stent is modeled as a series of interconnected wire segments that is released inside the vascular model under the influence of angular and stretching forces that try to recover the reference (un-deformed) configuration and contact forces with the vascular wall that constrain the stent to the vessel interior. This methodology attempts to properly capture the foreshortening characteristics of these devices, which is extremely important because in the majority of treatments the stents are oversized in order to achieve a good wall apposition against the parent artery. The methodology was tested against theoretical results of a series of stents released into straight tubes of varying diameters. The results indicate that the numerical models were able to reproduce the stent foreshortening characteristics in these situations to within a 1% error. Subsequently, the hemodynamic effects of the geometric deformation of the stent cells due to the foreshortening of oversized stents were studied using the patient-specific geometry of a giant internal carotid artery aneurysm with a wide neck.

Post-stenting flow conditions were estimated from the pre-stenting flows measured on the contralateral side.

As the IA grows there is a greater risk of rupture–an event that can lead to severe hemorrhage, and other complications, including sudden death. Due to the risks associated with treatment, it is important from a clinical perspective to identify which aneurysms are at risk for rupture, so these aneurysms can be treated and risky procedures can be avoided in others. Currently, the most reliable indicator of risk is IA size. However, while larger IAs are more likely to rupture than small IAs, due to the large number of small IAs, most aneurysms that rupture are small. Hence, size is insufficient for risk stratification. There is a pressing need to better understand disease progression in order to identify a clinically useful metric for improving risk assessment. Further such knowledge will be critical for the rational development of alternate treatment strategies. While IA samples can be obtained following treatment by surgical clipping, this tissue only represents one time point in the pathology. Animal models for IAs provide a means of studying multiple time points in disease progression. However, it is vital to prove the relevance of these models. Here, we compare the mechanical and wall properties for a commonly used elastase induced saccular aneurysm model in rabbits [1] with those in 8 human IAs [3-5].

Hemodynamic Characteristics at Anterior Communicating Artery Before Aneurys Initiation Using Patient-Specific Finite Element Blood Flow Simulations,"Marcelo A Castro, Christopher M Putman, Juan R Cebral",2011,Journal Mecánica Computacional,"The anterior communicating artery (AComA) is a unique vascular location that receives blood from two sources of inflow and redistributes it toward the anterior part of the brain through two efferent arteries. It is widely accepted that complexity in the flow pattern is associated with the high rate of aneurysm formation in that location observed in large studies. A previous computational hemodynamic study showed a possible association between high maximum intraaneurysmal wall shear stress (WSS) at the systolic peak with rupture in a cohort of AComA aneurysms. In another study it was observed a connection between location of aneurysm blebs and regions of high WSS in models where blebs were virtually removed. The purpose of this work is to study associations between hemodynamic patterns and AComA aneurysm initiation by comparing hemodynamics between the aneurysm models and the normal model where the aneurysm was computationally removed.

Patient-specific vascular computational fluid dynamics models of five cerebral aneurysms were constructed from bilateral 3D rotational angiography images. The aneurysmal hemodynamics was analyzed under a range of physiologic flow conditions including the effects of unequal mean flows and phase shifts between the flow waveforms of the left and right internal carotid arteries. A total of five simulations were performed for each patient, and unsteady wall shear stress (WSS) maps were created for each flow condition.

Estimation of pressure gradients at renal artery stenoses,"Peter J Yim, Juan Raul Cebral, Ashley Weaver, Robert J Lutz, G Boudewijn C Vasbinder",2003/5/2,"Conference Medical Imaging 2003: Physiology and Function: Methods, Systems, and Applications","Atherosclerotic disease of the renal artery can reduce the blood flow leading to renovascular hypertension and ischemic nephopathy. The kidney responds to a decrease in blood flow by activation of the renin-angiotensin system that increases blood pressure and can result in severe hypertension. Percutaneous translumenal angioplasty (PTA) may be indicated for treatment of renovascular hypertension (RVH). However, direct measurement of renal artery caliber and degree of stenosis has only moderate specificity for detection of RVH. A confounding factor in assessment of the proximal renal artery is that diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the distal branches of the renal artery can produce the same effect on blood-flow as atherosclerotic disease of the proximal renal artery.

Unstructured grid generation over buildings intersecting terrain data using a feature-preserving volumetric technique,"J Cebral, F Camelli, R Loehner",2002,Book 40th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting & Exhibit,"In this paper a new methodology to generate unstructured grids over intersecting objects is presented. It is based on the extraction of the zero-level iso-surface from a signed distance map defined on an adaptive background grid. The background grid points are first created following local object voxelizations and then connected using a Delaunay triangulation algorithm. A point enrichment strategy is then used to introduce new points into the background grid along detected surface features, ie ridges. The background grid is then adaptively refined close to the object surfaces and the distance to the surface function is computed. The final merged surface is obtained by extracting the zero-distance iso-surface. This watertight triangulation is then used as a support surface for unstructured grid generation from discrete data.

Quantification of the Rupture Potential of Patient-Specific Intracranial Aneurysms under Contact Constraints,"Manjurul Alam, Fernando Mut, Juan R Cebral, Padmanabhan Seshaiyer",2021/11,Journal Bioengineering,"Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are localized enlargements of cerebral blood vessels that cause substantial rates of mortality and morbidity in humans. The rupture possibility of these aneurysms is a critical medical challenge for physicians during treatment planning. This treatment planning while assessing the rupture potential of aneurysms becomes more complicated when they are constrained by an adjacent structure such as optic nerve tissues or bones, which is not widely studied yet. In this work, we considered and studied a constitutive model to investigate the bio-mechanical response of image-based patient-specific IA data using cardiovascular structural mechanics equations. We performed biomechanical modeling and simulations of four different patient-specific aneurysms’ data (three middle cerebral arteries and one internal carotid artery) to assess the rupture potential of those aneurysms under a plane contact constraint. Our results suggest that aneurysms with plane contact constraints produce less or almost similar maximum wall effective stress compared to aneurysms with no contact constraints. In our research findings, we observed that a plane contact constraint on top of an internal carotid artery might work as a protective wall due to the 16.6% reduction in maximum wall effective stress than that for the case where there is no contact on top of the aneurysm.",

The purpose of this study was to analyze the blood flow field in a growing cerebral aneurysm using experimental particle image velocimetry (PIV) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. Patient-specific models were constructed from 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) images acquired at one-year intervals during a conservative follow up period. Physical silicone models were constructed from the CTA images using rapid prototyping techniques and the pulsatile blood flow fields were measured with PIV. Corresponding CFD models were created and run under pulsatile flows matching the experimental flow conditions. For comparison, the PIV and CFD models were aligned and the corresponding flow fields interpolated to a common grid covering the aneurysm volume. The blood flow fields were then visualized and compared qualitatively by inspection and quantitatively by defining a similarity measure between the PIV and CFD vector fields. The results indicate that the experimental and computational flow fields are in good agreement.

The goal of these devices is to deviate the blood flow away from the aneurysm and promote its thrombosis and exclusion from the circulation. However, one of the major concerns with these devices is the possibility of occluding a small arterial branch or perforating artery that may be jailed by the stent mesh. This could result in an ischemic stroke. The goal of this study was to assess the reduction in the flow rate in jailed side branches after stenting of cerebral aneurysms.",

Fast Computation of Blood Flows in Arterial Models,"Fernando Mut, Rainald Löhner, Juan Cebral",2009/6/17,Conference Summer Bioengineering Conference,"The computation of the blood flow in arterial models requires the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations [1,2]. The geometry of these models is characterized by complex branching tubular domains. The main challenge with this kind of geometries is that the convergence rate of the pressure Poisson solver is dominated by the graph depth of the computational grid. The purpose of this paper is to present a novel technique (deflated conjugate gradients algorithm) for accelerating the solution of the pressure Poisson equation that is especially suited for elongated domains.",

Coarse-Grain Deflation for Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Solvers: Application to the Pressure Poisson Equation,"Fernando Mut, Romain Aubry, Guillaume Pierrot, Jean Roger, Juan Cebral, Rainald Lohner",2009,Book 47th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting including The New Horizons Forum and Aerospace Exposition,"A deflated preconditioned conjugate gradient technique has been developed for the solution of the Pressure-Poisson equation within an incompressible flow solver. The deflation is done using a region-based decomposition of the unknowns, making it extremely simple to implement. This procedure belongs to the family of hybrid methods (making use of both direct and iterative solvers) and the preconditioner obtained belongs to the class of optimal ones just as Multigrid and Domain Decomposition Methods. The procedure has shown a considerable reduction in the number of iterations. For grids with large graph-depth the savings exceed an order of magnitude. Furthermore, the technique has shown a remarkable insensitivity to the number of groups/regions chosen, and to the way the groups are formed.",
"Relating Wall Shear Stress, Bleb Formation and Rupture of Cerebral Aneurysms: Image-Based Modeling and Clinical Observations","Juan R Cebral, Christopher M Putman",2008/6/25,Conference Summer Bioengineering Conference,"Cerebral aneurysms are widely believed to form and grow as a result of the interactions of hemodynamics and wall mechano-biology. Researchers have used a variety of tools to study these complex multi-factorial mechanisms including animal, in vitro, and computational models. The goal of these experiments has been to approximate the in vivo environment so that theories about the natural history of brain aneurysms can be developed and tested in realistic systems. Studying the link between hemodynamics and clinical observations of aneurysm progression is necessary to reach an understanding of the relative importance of the different mechanisms involved in these processes [1].

Techniques for Virtual Stenting of Intracranial Aneurysms,"Sunil Appanaboyina, Fernando Mut, Rainald Löhner, Christopher M Putman, Juan R Cebral",2007/6/20,Conference Summer Bioengineering Conference,"Intracranial aneurysms are pathological dilations of the arteries in the brain, whose rupture is often fatal. Surgery and endovascular embolization are the two most common methods of treatment. Surgery involves opening a portion of the skull and placing metallic clips at the aneurysm neck thereby preventing blood flow into the aneurysm. In the case of embolization, a catheter is used to pack platinum coils in the aneurysm reducing the inflow and promoting thrombus formation. Due to its less invasive approach endovascular embolization is preferred over surgery. Nevertheless this approach also has some serious aftereffects. Coil compaction followed by the re-growth or the formation of the secondary aneurysm is the most common problem. The endovascular embolization approach also has a serious shortcoming that the coils alone cannot be used to block every type of aneurysm. Wide neck or fusiform aneurysms …",
Hemodynamics and the Natural History of Cerebral Aneurysms,"Juan R Cebral, Marcelo A Castro, Christopher M Putman",2007/6/20,Conference Summer Bioengineering Conference,"The mechanisms responsible for the evolution and rupture of cerebral aneurysms are not well understood. This is a multi-factorial problem, and previous studies [1–3] have identified the major factors involved: a) arterial hemodynamics, b) mechanobiology and wall biomechanics, and c) peri-aneurysmal environment. In this paper we present recent results based on patient-specific computational hemodynamics models of a number of cerebral aneurysms that indicate that hemodynamics plays an important role both in the progression and rupture of intracranial aneurysms. In particular, the data seems to support the idea that mechanisms associated to high wall shear stress may be responsible for the evolution and rupture of these aneurysms [4].",

Particular relevance is placed on the number of users, their concerns, the machines on which the codes operate as they mature, as well as the relative importance of parallel computing. It is seen that parallel computing achieves the highest importance in the early phases of code development, acting as an enabling technology without which new scientific codes could not develop. Given the typical times, new applications tend to run at their inception, Moore's law itself is perhaps the biggest incentive for new scientific computing codes. Without it, computing time would not decrease in the future and the range of applications would soon be exhausted.

Advances In FSI Using Body-fitted Unstructured Grids,JR Cebral,2005/9/1,Journal WIT Transactions on The Built Environment,"Several algorithms for the loose coupling of fluid and structural dynamics codes are described. The first class of algorithms treats the displacement of the surface of structure that is in contact with the fluid. It is shown that a straightforward treatment of the displacements for arbitrary choice of timesteps can lead to instabilities. For optimal stability, at each timestep the ending time of the fluid should be just beyond the ending time of the structure. The second class of algorithms treats the movement of the flow mesh in an ALE setting. The use of a projective prediction of mesh velocities, as well as linelet preconditioning for the resulting PCG system, can significantly reduce the effort required. Examples are included that show the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. 1 Introduction While CFD solvers based on adaptive cartesian or unstructured grids are commonly used for complex Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations, for applications that require the proper resolution of boundary layers the moving, body-fitted mesh approach with arbitrary Lagrangean–Eulerian (ALE) formulation remains the only viable option to date. The need to extend the range of applicability of this type of approach to long-term FSI runs, such as bridges, chimneys and offshore platforms, has led to a series of algorithmic improvements which are the subject of this paper. In particular, the following subjects will be treated:-synchronization of times between loosely coupled CFD and CSD solvers in order to minimize grid distortion; and-projective prediction to accelerate the convergence of the PCG solver of the mesh velocities.",

Med,"Methods: A 3D model of the circle of Willis (CoW) was constructed from MRA data using an iso-surface deformable model approach [4], and the main efferent vessels were truncated after one or two generations. For each of these vessels, an arterial tree model was generated using an image-based constrained constructive optimization method [4, 5]. In this well-established approach, a location inside a perfusion volume (specified from MR images) is randomly selected and a new arterial branch is created connecting this point with the closest branch of the current tree, subject to a set of physiological boundary conditions and geometric constraints (eg the radii of the segments must obey a power law at bifurcations, the new branch must not intersect any other branch, and the total intravascular volume must be minimized [4, 5]). This algorithm was modified so that multiple arterial trees for each cerebral hemisphere are …",

Interpretation of arterial velocity waveforms,"Peter J Yim, Juan Raul Cebral, Rainald Loehner, Orlando Soto, Hani Marcos, Peter L Choyke",2001/5/21,Conference Medical Imaging 2001: Physiology and Function from Multidimensional Images,"Blood flow temporal waveforms change with position along an artery. The change in the flow waveforms can be accounted for by a transmission line model of flow. According to this model, pulse waves propagate at a finite velocity in both directions along the artery. In principle, given flow waveforms measured at three locations along an artery, the pulse-wave velocity, (c) can be determined from the wave equation (d2Q/dt2 equals c2d2Q/dz2, Q is flow, t is time, z is position). Given the vessel diameter, the vessel-wall compliance can be derived from pulse-wave velocity. However, direct solution of the wave equation for pulse-wave velocity is highly susceptible to flow-measurement error. Thus, we propose a new method for estimating pulse-wave velocity from arterial flow waveforms. In our method, ideal flow waveforms are reconstructed from three measured flow waveforms. The ideal waveforms are reconstructed by …",

Effective Remodeling in the Walls of Cerebral Aneurysms,"Anne Robertson, Xinjie Duane, Khaled Aziz, Juan Cebral","Intracranial hemorrhage due to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA) has devastating effects with high mortality and disability rates. Since risks from IA treatment may exceed the natural risk of rupture, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to identify robust IAs that can be monitored, thereby avoiding unnecessary treatment. Much of current risk assessment research is directed at looking for correlations between rupture status and clinically measurable quantities. In a prior work [1], we identified two sub-classes of unruptured aneurysms, one with low failure stress (0.63 MPa, 0.73 MPa) and a second group with failure stress from 1.2 MPa to 2.2 MPa. This diversity in strength is consistent with evidence of diversity in cellular content [2]. Therefore, treating the unruptured population as a single cohort can confound risk stratification. The focus of the present talk is the robust group of unruptured IAs.Strength alone is not a guarantee of low rupture risk since rupture depends on level of intramural stress. In contrast, the factor of safety (FoS) can be used to assess the degree of overdesign. Using computational models, we determined the FoS for weaker IAs was less than 1.5 and ranged from 3.15-10.9 for stronger IAs (max load 300mmHg). This diversity in FoS was also found in ex vivo tests on intact IAs [3]. A 5 mm IA ruptured at 325 mmHg, whereas a 6 mm IA remained unruptured even during repeated loads to 550 mmHg. The average values for peak systolic/diastolic pressure for healthy volunteers were 320/250 mmHg during double leg presses [4], suggesting the first IA was vulnerable.","Scholar articles Effective Remodeling in the Walls of Cerebral AneurysmsA Robertson, X Duane, K Aziz, J CebralRelated articles ","Intracranial hemorrhage due to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA) has devastating effects with high mortality and disability rates.

The potential role of lipid accumulation in intracranial artery aneurysm wall degeneration and its relation to the hemodynamics,"Riikka Tulamo, Eliisa Ollikainen, Juan Cebral, Mika Niemelä, Anne Robertson, Juhana Frösen","Inflammation and degeneration of the intracranial artery aneurysm wall associate with aneurysm rupture. Earlier studies have shown that the accumulation of lipids in the intracranial aneurysm wall associates with aneurysm wall degeneration and inflammation. Such lipid accumulation is also seen in normal intracranial arteries, but restricted to the intima only. However, in intracranial aneurysms the lipids accumulate throughout the wall, become oxidatively modified and become also digested by the mural cells. The mechanisms that lead to lipid accumulation and associated intracranial aneurysm wall degeneration are not fully understood.We studied the presence of different types of lipids in 16 unruptured and 20 ruptured intracranial aneurysm walls resected during the aneurysm surgery by histological and immunohistochemical staining. 5 unruptured and 5 ruptured aneurysms were also studied with respect to flow dynamics and aneurysm geometry based on preoperative imaging studies. In histological studies, we found an accumulation of neutral lipids (Oil-red-O), different apolipoproteins (Apo-B100, LDL; Apo-A1, HDL), oxidized lipids (hydroxynonenal) and adipophilin, a marker of cellular lipid intake, to associate with aneurysm wall degeneration and the related loss of mural smooth muscle cells (SMC). We found lipid intake not only by macrophages but also by SMCs, which associated with the loss of these mural SMCs.

"INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS: CONNECTING HEMODYNAMICS, BIOMECHANICS AND WALL CHARACTERISTICS","Juan R Cebral, Anne M Robertson","1 BACKGROUNDIncreased detection of incidental unruptured intracranial aneurysms has made the clinical decision making process and management of patients with this disease more challenging since the risk of complications of surgical and endovascular interventions can easily exceed the aneurysms’ natural risk of rupture. On the other hand, because aneurysm rupture and subsequent subarachnoid hemorrhage have disastrous consequences it is common to consider preventive treatment. A better strategy would be to treat only those aneurysms that are at high risk of rupture and avoid unnecessary interventions for low risk aneurysms that could safely be followed non-invasively. However, this strategy requires adequate discrimination between high and low risk aneurysms, which has been one of the main focus of aneurysm research for several decades.","Scholar articles INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS: CONNECTING HEMODYNAMICS, BIOMECHANICS AND WALL CHARACTERISTICSJR Cebral, AM RobertsonRelated articles ",1 BACKGROUND,

Aneurysm Modelling: from Basic Science to Clinical Translation,"Paul N Watton, Juan Cebral, Anne M Robertson","Aneurysms most commonly occur in the abdominal aorta and in the cerebral arteries. Whilst the aetiology of the diseases differ, abdominal aortic aneurysms and intracranial aneurysms may rupture with significant risk of fatality. Moreover, the inception and evolution of both types of aneurysms appears to be intimately linked to the mechanobiology of the arterial wall [1]. Modelling may yield insight into the disease and lead to the development of computational tools to assist clinical diagnostic procedures, consequently such research has grown extensively in recent years; for recent review articles, see, eg,[2-4].Aneurysm research spans a broad spectrum: in vivo, in vitro and in silico models are employed to address questions spanning from basic science to translational research. To succeed in this challenging, competitive arena, multidisciplinary collaborations are becoming essential. Consequently, there is a need to provide multi-disciplinary forums tobring together researchers of different disciplines, eg, with expertise in: mathematical modeling; solid mechanics; fluid mechanics; imaging; vascular biology; translation of models into clinical practice. It is the objective of this mini-symposium to provide a stimulating, multi-disciplinary environment to share recent advances in knowledge, establish new-collaborations and drive research forward in this field. We warmly invite contributions from all areas of aneurysm research.","Scholar articles Aneurysm Modelling: from Basic Science to Clinical TranslationPN Watton, J Cebral, AM RobertsonRelated articles All 2 versions ","Aneurysms most commonly occur in the abdominal aorta and in the cerebral arteries.

ADAPTIVE EMBEDDED UNSTRUCTURED GRID METHODS,"Juan Cebral, Marcelo Castro, Joseph D Baum, Hong Luo, Eric Mestreau","A simple embedded domain method for node-based unstructured grid solvers is presented. The key modification of the original, edge-based solver is to remove all geometryparameters (essentially the normals) belonging to edges cut by embedded surface faces. Several techniques to improve the treatment of boundary points close to the immersed surfaces are explored. Alternatively, higher-order boundary conditions are achieved by duplicating crossed edges and their endpoints. Adaptive mesh refinement based on proximity to or the curvature of the embedded CSD surfaces is used to enhance the accuracy of the solution. User-defined or automatic deactivation for the regions inside immersed solid bodies is employed to avoid unnecessary work. Recent work has led to a notable improvement in speed via suitable data structures, the option to treat dispersed particles in the context of embedded surfaces, a direct link to Discrete Particle Methods (DPM), a volume to surface meshing technique that obtains bodyfitted grids by post-processing adaptive embedded grids; and links to simplified CSD models. Several examples are included that show the viability of this approach for inviscid and viscous, compressible and incompressible, steady and unsteady flows, as well as coupled fluid-structure problems.","Scholar articles ADAPTIVE EMBEDDED UNSTRUCTURED GRID METHODSJ Cebral, M Castro, JD Baum, H Luo, E MestreauRelated articles ","A simple embedded domain method for node-based unstructured grid solvers is presented.
