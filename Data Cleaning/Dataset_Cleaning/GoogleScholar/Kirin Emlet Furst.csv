"Co-occurrence of geogenic and anthropogenic contaminants in groundwater from Rajasthan, India","Rachel M Coyte, Anjali Singh, Kirin E Furst, William A Mitch, Avner Vengosh",2019/10/20,Journal Science of the Total Environment,"Northwest India suffers from severe water scarcity issues due to a combination of over-exploitation and climate effects. Along with concerns over water availability, endemic water quality issues are critical and affect the usability of available water and potential human health risks. Here we present data from 243 groundwater wells, representing nine aquifer lithologies in 4 climate regions that were collected from the Northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. Rajasthan is India's largest state by area, and has a significant groundwater reliant population due to a general lack of surface water accessibility. We show that the groundwater, including water that is used for drinking without any treatment, contains multiple inorganic contaminants in levels that exceed both Indian and World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guidelines. The most egregious of these violations were for fluoride, nitrate, and uranium; 76% of all …",61
Tradeoffs between pathogen inactivation and disinfection byproduct formation during sequential chlorine and chloramine disinfection for wastewater reuse,"Kirin E Furst, Brian M Pecson, Brie D Webber, William A Mitch",2018/10/15,Journal Water research,"Treatment of fully nitrified municipal wastewater effluents with chlorine followed by chloramines (i.e., sequential chlorine disinfection) upstream of advanced treatment trains can contribute pathogen inactivation credits for potable reuse while leaving a chloramine residual to control biofouling on membrane units in the advanced treatment train. However, free chlorine exposures must be optimized to maximize pathogen inactivation while minimizing the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that are challenging to remove in the advanced treatment train. Using a pilot-scale disinfection contactor receiving fully-nitrified, tertiary municipal wastewater effluent, this study found that a 3 mg × min/L free chlorine CT (i.e., the product of the chlorine residual “C” and the contact time “T”) followed by a 140 mg × min/L chloramine CT could reliably achieve 5-log inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage and reduce median total …",53
"Disinfection byproducts in Rajasthan, India: are trihalomethanes a sufficient indicator of disinfection byproduct exposure in low-income countries?","Kirin E Furst, Rachel M Coyte, Margaret Wood, Avner Vengosh, William A Mitch",2019/9/24,Journal Environmental science & technology,"The implementation of chlorine disinfection in low-income countries reduces the risk of waterborne illness but initiates exposure to disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Like high-income countries, low-income countries typically are adopting regulations focusing on trihalomethanes (THM4) as an indicator of overall DBP exposure. However, the use of impaired water sources can decouple the formation of THM4 from other DBP classes that are more potent toxins. The documentation of DBP species other than THM4 is rare in low-income countries, where water sources may be degraded by inadequate sanitation infrastructure and other uncontrolled wastewater discharges. We measured THM4 and 21 unregulated DBPs in tap waters and laboratory-treated source waters from two cities in northwestern India. The contribution of each DBP class to the cumulative toxicity was estimated by weighting each species by metrics of …",32
Distributed chlorine injection to minimize NDMA formation during chloramination of wastewater,"Kirin E Furst, Brian M Pecson, Brie D Webber, William A Mitch",2018/6/5,Journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters,"N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), an important contaminant for potable reuse of municipal wastewater, forms from reactions of dichloramine and amine precursors. Injection of concentrated free chlorine stock solutions into wastewaters containing low levels of ammonia can promote NDMA formation because the high chlorine:ammonia ratio at the point of chlorine injection fosters dichloramine formation during mixing. This study combined chemical kinetic modeling, laboratory mixing studies using deionized water and authentic wastewater effluents, and a pilot-scale disinfectant contactor at a wastewater reuse facility to demonstrate that the distribution of the injection of concentrated hypochlorite stock solutions can reduce the level of NDMA formation by ≤50% compared to injection at a single location. Modeling and deionized water experiments indicated that this reduction was associated with a reduction in the …",28
Use of trihalomethanes as a surrogate for haloacetonitrile exposure introduces misclassification bias,"Kirin E Furst, Jose Bolorinos, William A Mitch",2021/5/1,Journal Water Research X,"Epidemiologists have used trihalomethanes (THMs) as a surrogate for overall disinfection byproduct (DBP) exposure based on the assumption that THM concentrations are proportional to concentrations of other DBP classes. Toxicological evidence indicates THMs are less potent toxins than unregulated classes like haloacetonitriles (HANs). If THMs are not proportional to the DBPs driving toxicity, the use of THMs to measure exposure may introduce non-trivial exposure misclassification bias in epidemiologic studies. This study developed statistical models to evaluate the covariance and proportionality of HAN and THM concentrations in a dataset featuring over 9500 measurements from 248 public water systems. THMs only explain ∼30% of the variance in HANs, whether the data is pooled in a classic linear regression or hierarchically grouped by water system in a multilevel linear regression. The 95% prediction …",14
Chlorine taste can increase simulated exposure to both fecal contamination and disinfection byproducts in water supplies,"Daniel W Smith, Mahfuza Islam, Kirin E Furst, Shobnom Mustaree, Yoshika S Crider, Nazrin Akter, Syed Anjerul Islam, Sonia Sultana, Zahid H Mahmud, Mahbubur Rahman, William A Mitch, Jennifer Davis",2021/12/1,Journal Water Research,"Expanding drinking water chlorination could substantially reduce the burden of disease in low- and middle-income countries, but the taste of chlorinated water often impedes adoption. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the effect of people's choice to accept or reject drinking water based on chlorine taste and their subsequent exposure to E. coli and trihalomethanes, a class of disinfection byproduct (DBP). The simulation used empirical data from Dhaka, Bangladesh, a megacity with endemic waterborne disease. We drew on published taste acceptability thresholds from Dhaka residents, measured residual chlorine and thermotolerant E. coli inactivation following the addition of six chlorine doses (0.25–3.0 mg/L as Cl2) to untreated piped water samples from 100 locations, and analyzed trihalomethane formation in 54 samples. A dose of 0.5 mg/L, 75% lower than the 2 mg/L dose typically …",7
Variations in Disinfection By-Product Precursors Bromide and Total Organic Carbon Among US Watersheds,"Richard J Weisman, Kirin E Furst, Celso M Ferreira",2023/2/1,Journal Environmental Engineering Science,"Watersheds with relatively higher concentrations of disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors are of concern for public water systems (PWSs) seeking to control DBP exposure risk. In this study, the occurrence of bromide and total organic carbon (TOC), which are important DBP precursors, was evaluated in PWS source waters on a watershed basis at the hydrologic unit code 2 (HUC2) level. Variations were examined across source water type (e.g., surface water or groundwater) and watershed, and temporally based on seasonality as well as differences between the late 1990s and the years 2018–2020. The median bromide concentrations were higher in groundwater systems compared with surface water (by 25 μg/L), whereas the median TOC concentrations were higher in surface water systems compared with groundwater (by 1.7 mg/L). Surface water sources in multiple midwestern and western watersheds …",
Effects of Intrusion on Disinfection Byproduct Formation in Intermittent Distribution Systems,"Kirin E Furst, Daniel W Smith, Linzi R Bhatta, Mahfuza Islam, Sonia Sultana, Mahbubur Rahman, Jennifer Davis, William A Mitch",2022/4/28,Journal ACS ES&T Water,"Intermittently operated distribution systems serve over one billion people and may be impacted by the intrusion of contaminated waters carrying disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors. The impact of intrusion on the formation of 19 DBPs was evaluated in an intermittent water system supplied by deep aquifers in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Untreated piped water samples were collected from residential taps and chlorinated under controlled conditions. Chloride, dissolved organic carbon, and the artificial sweetener sucralose were measured as indicators of intrusion. Most piped water samples had low concentrations of DBPs and indicators; however, a subset had higher levels of DBPs and indicators, suggesting the intrusion of contaminated water into the distribution system, particularly during the rainy season. Piped water samples with evidence of intrusion typically formed higher concentrations of haloacetaldehydes and …",
A Challenge and an Opportunity for Graduate Admissions,"K.E. Furst, R.C. Scholes, A.R. Ceccheti, J.O. Sharp",2021/2/7,Journal Prism,"As part of people's nationwide reckoning with systemic racism, engineers and academics have been called to confront the inequities in their fields. Despite years of university diversity and inclusion initiatives, racial disparities remain stark in graduate engineering. Black students continue to be severely underrepresented; women and people of other marginalized identities remain underrepresented as well. Lack of diversity in graduate programs translates into lack of diversity in their faculty and the engineering organizations that hire their graduates, limiting their ability to address the needs of the diverse populations they serve.",
Policy and Engineering Strategies to Manage Public Health Risk from Disinfection Byproduct Mixtures in Wastewater-Impacted Drinking Waters,Kirin E Furst,2020,Institution Stanford University,"The advent of drinking water disinfection to inactivate pathogens was a significant public health achievement. However, disinfectants react with dissolved organics to form disinfection byproducts (DBPs), which have been associated with bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, and adverse reproductive outcomes. After 50 years of research, it remains unclear which DBP classes drive the toxicity of disinfected drinking water. Globally, trihalomethanes (THMs) are the most commonly regulated DBP class. THMs are used as a surrogate for DBP exposure based on the assumption that they are representative of the overall DBP mixture. Two recent trends challenge this assumption: 1) the identification of hundreds of DBP species with precursors and formation pathways distinct from THMs, and 2) an increase in potable reuse of reclaimed municipal wastewater, which contains precursors that promote the formation of nitrogen …",
Water quality as a limiting factor for sustainable utilization of groundwater in Northwestern India,"Avner Vengosh, Rachel Coyte, Kirin Emlet Furst, William Mitch",2019/12,Journal AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,"Groundwater is a crucial resource for the domestic and agricultural sectors in India. One of the largest and most exploited aquifers is the Indo-Gangetic basin alluvial aquifer (IGB) of northern and northwestern India, where large-scale groundwater depletion has coincided with severe water quality issues. Projected fluctuations in monsoon intensity and timing, associated with global warming have raised concerns about future groundwater availability. Several studies have shown the occurrence of several contaminants in concentrations that pose human health risks, including arsenic, uranium, fluoride, nitrate, and salinity originating from both natural (geogenic) and anthropogenic sources. Elevated levels of nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater from Rajasthan have raised concerns for the possible formation of highly toxic disinfection byproducts (DPBs) in drinking water. A recent study has …",
