A quantitative trust establishment framework for reliable data packet delivery in MANETs,"Charikleia Zouridaki, Brian L Mark, Marek Hejmo, Roshan K Thomas",2005/11/7,Book Proceedings of the 3rd ACM workshop on Security of ad hoc and sensor networks,"In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), a source node must rely on other nodes to forward its packets on multi-hop routes to the destination. Secure and reliable handling of packets by the intermediate nodes is difficult to ensure in an ad hoc environment. We propose a trust establishment scheme for MANETs which aims to improve the reliability of packet forwarding over multi-hop routes in the presence of potentially malicious nodes. Each node forms an ""opinion"" about each of the other nodes based on both first and second-hand observation data collected from the network. The opinion metric can be incorporated into ad hoc routing protocols to achieve reliable packet delivery even when a portion of the network exhibits malicious behavior. We present numerical results which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trust establishment scheme.",233
"Large capacity, multiclass core ATM switch architecture","Ruixue Fan, Brian L Mark, Gopalakrishnan Ramamurthy",2001/11/27,Patent office US,"A large capacity ATM core switch architecture is disclosed, which supports multiple traffic classes and quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees.

Modeling and analysis of opportunistic spectrum sharing with unreliable spectrum sensing,"Shensheng Tang, Brian L Mark",2008/11/17,Journal IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,"We analyze the performance of a wireless system consisting of a set of secondary users opportunistically sharing bandwidth with a set of primary users over a coverage area. The secondary users employ spectrum sensing to detect channels that are unused by the primary users and hence make use of the idle channels. If an active secondary user detects the presence of a primary user on a given channel, it releases the channel and switches to another idle channel, if one is available. In the event that no channel is available, the call waits in a buffer until either a channel becomes available or a maximum waiting time is reached. Spectrum sensing errors on the part of a secondary user cause false alarm and mis-detection events, which can potentially degrade the quality-of-service experienced by primary users. We derive system performance metrics of interest such as blocking probabilities. Our results suggest that …",146
Real-time mobility tracking algorithms for cellular networks based on Kalman filtering,"Zainab R Zaidi, Brian L Mark",2005/2/7,Journal IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,"We propose two algorithms for real-time tracking of the location and dynamic motion of a mobile station in a cellular network using the pilot signal strengths from neighboring base stations. The underlying mobility model is based on a dynamic linear system driven by a discrete command process that determines the mobile station's acceleration. The command process is modeled as a semi-Markov process over a finite set of acceleration levels. The first algorithm consists of an averaging filter for processing pilot signal, strength measurements and two Kalman filters, one to estimate the discrete command process and the other to estimate the mobility state. The second algorithm employs a single Kalman filter without prefiltering and is able to track a mobile station even when a limited set of pilot signal measurements is available.

According to the inventive DRC, each traffic stream associated with an internal switch queue is rate-shaped according to a rate which consists of a minimum guaranteed rate and a dynamic component computed based on congestion information within the switch. While achieving high utilization, DRC guarantees a minimum throughput for each stream and fairly distributes unused bandwidth. The distribution of unused bandwidth in DRC can be assigned flexibly, ie, the unused bandwidth need not be shared in proportion to the minimum throughput guarantees, as in weighted fair share schedulers. Moreover, an effective closed-loop QoS control can be built into DRC by dynamically updating a set of weights based on observed QoS. Another salient feature of DRC is its ability to …",135

On a given frequency channel, a secondary user can perform spectrum sensing to determine spatial or temporal opportunities for spectrum reuse. Whereas most prior works address either spatial or temporal sensing in isolation, we propose a joint spatial-temporal spectrum-sensing scheme that exploits information from spatial sensing to improve the performance of temporal sensing. We quantify the performance benefit of the joint spatial-temporal scheme over pure spatial sensing and pure temporal sensing based on counting-rule and linear quadratic (LQ) detectors.

Modeling and analysis of interference in Listen‐Before‐Talk spectrum access schemes,"Alexe E Leu, Mark McHenry, Brian L Mark",2006/3,Journal International Journal of Network Management,"Spectrum measurement studies have shown that substantial portions of the allocated wireless spectrum are highly underutilized. Frequency‐agile radios (FARs) have the potential to make opportunistic use of such spectrum holes without causing harmful interference to users of the allocated spectrum. Toward this goal, we develop a framework for modeling the interference caused by FARs employing spectrum access mechanisms based on the simple Listen‐Before‐Talk (LBT) scheme. Two variations of LBT are considered: individual LBT, whereby the FARs act independently of each other; and collaborative LBT, whereby the FARs communicate with each other in order to more accurately identify the spectrum holes. Our analysis of the LBT scheme reveals the fundamental interdependencies among key system design metrics and provides a basis for analyzing more complex spectrum access methods. In particular …",109
An efficient eigenvector approach for finding netlist partitions,"Scott W Hadley, Brian L Mark, Anthony Vannelli",1992/7,Journal IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,"A fast eigenvector technique for obtaining good initial node partitions of netlists for use in interchange heuristics is described. The method is based on approximating the netlist or hypergraph by a weighted graph G, such that the sum of the cut edges in G tightly underestimates the number of cut nets in any netlist partition. An eigenvector technique is used to partition the graph G into k blocks of fixed module size. Another feature of this graph underestimation model of the netlist is that it allows one to obtain lower bounds on the actual number of cut nets. A multiblock node interchange heuristic is tested on the one resulting netlist partition obtained by this eigenvector approach on a variety of small to large sized benchmark netlist partitioning problems (between 300 to 12000 modules and nets). Test results on the larger netlists show that in most cases this eigenvector-node interchange approach yields netlist partitions …",109

Proceedings","We describe ""NetBouncer"", an approach and set of technologies for providing practical and high-performance defenses against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The central innovation in the NetBouncer approach to filtering and mitigating DDoS attacks is the ability to distinguish legitimate traffic from illegitimate ones so as to enable the discarding of only illegitimate traffic. In particular, this allows a NetBouncer-enabled network to distinguish DDoS congestion from flash crowd congestion situations. This provides a unique advantage over other DDoS mitigation techniques such as those based on filtering and congestion control where some loss of legitimate traffic is inevitable. The NetBouncer approach is characterized as an end-point-based solution to DDoS protection. It provides localized protection at potential choke points or bottlenecks that may exist in front of hosts and servers. NetBouncer attempts …",105
Estimation of maximum interference-free power level for opportunistic spectrum access,"Brian L Mark, Ahmed O Nasif",2009/5/26,Journal IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,"We consider a scenario in which frequency agile radios opportunistically share a fixed spectrum resource with a set of primary nodes. We develop a collaborative scheme for a group of frequency agile radios to estimate the maximum power at which they can transmit on a given frequency channel, without causing harmful interference to the primary receivers. The proposed scheme relies on signal strength measurements taken by a group of frequency agile radios, which are then used by a target node to characterize the spatial size of its perceived spectrum hole in terms of the maximum permissible transmit power. We derive an approximation to the maximum interference-free transmit power using the Cramer-Rao bound on localization accuracy.

Mark, Yariv Ephraim",2013/9/1,Journal IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,"A new statistical model, in the form of a hidden bivariate Markov chain observed through a Gaussian channel, is developed and applied to spectrum sensing for cognitive radio. We focus on temporal spectrum sensing in a single narrowband channel in which a primary transmitter is either in an idle or an active state. The main advantage of the proposed model, compared to a standard hidden Markov model (HMM), is that it allows a phase-type dwell time distribution for the process in each state. This distribution significantly generalizes the geometric dwell time distribution of a standard HMM. Measurements taken from real data confirm that the geometric dwell time distribution characteristic of the HMM is not adequate for this application. The Baum algorithm is used to estimate the parameter of the proposed model and a forward recursion is applied to online estimation and prediction of the state of the cognitive radio …",92

Performance modeling of optical-burst switching with fiber delay lines,"Xiaomin Lu, Brian L Mark",2004/12/20,Journal IEEE Transactions on Communications,"We develop analytical models to evaluate the performance of optical-burst switch (OBS) architectures employing fiber delay lines (FDLs) as optical buffers to reduce burst-loss probability. The performance of such architectures cannot be captured accurately using traditional queueing models, since FDLs behave fundamentally differently from conventional electronic buffers. We formulate a Markovian model to evaluate the system performance when the burst-arrival process is Poisson and the burst lengths are exponentially distributed under an idealized model of FDL behavior. The model accurately captures both the balking and deterministic delay properties of FDLs, but the complexity of the model makes it infeasible for solving problems of practical interest.

Analysis of virus spread in wireless sensor networks: An epidemic model,"Shensheng Tang, Brian L Mark",2009/10/25,Conference 2009 7th international workshop on design of reliable communication networks,"We study the potential threat for virus spread in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Using epidemic theory, we proposed a new model, called susceptible-infective-recovered with maintenance (SIR-M), to characterize the dynamics of the virus spread process from a single node to the entire network. By introducing a maintenance mechanism in the sleep mode of WSNs, the SIR-M model can improve the network's anti-virus capability and enable the network to adapt flexibly to different types of viruses, without incurring additional computational or signaling overhead. The proposed model can capture both the spatial and temporal dynamics of the virus spread process.

Statistical geolocation of Internet hosts,"Inja Youn, Brian L Mark, Dana Richards",2009/8/3,Conference 2009 Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks,"Automated geolocation of IP addresses has important applications to targeted delivery of local news, advertising and other content over the Internet. Previous measurement-based approaches to geolocation employ active probing to measure delays among a set of landmark nodes with known locations. The location of a target IP address can be approximated by that of the nearest landmark, as determined by the delay measurements. To improve geolocation accuracy, a variation of this approach uses multilateration with geographic distance constraints to obtain a continuous location space rather than the discrete set of landmark locations. Since the previous approaches are fundamentally deterministic, they can only provide relatively loose bounds on the true location of an IP address. We develop a statistical geolocation scheme based on applying kernel density estimation to delay measurements among a set of …",74

The UPC values are used in a traffic shaping mechanism based on a dual leaky bucket, which shapes the cell stream by either discarding or delaying cells. The choice of UPC values is a function of the statistical characteristics of the observed cell stream; the user's tolerance for delay prior to the network access point; and the cost incurred on the network side. The chosen UPC values are then negotiated with the network. The source traffic characteristics may change dramatically over time, making the initially negotiated UPC descriptor inappropriate for the entire traffic stream.

Analysis of opportunistic spectrum sharing with Markovian arrivals and phase-type service,"Shensheng Tang, Brian L Mark",2009/6/23,Journal IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,"We develop a general framework for analyzing the performance of an opportunistic spectrum sharing (OSS) wireless system at the session level with Markovian arrivals and phasetype service times. The OSS system consists of primary or licensed users of the spectrum and secondary users that sense the channel status and opportunistically share the spectrum resources with the primary users in a coverage area.

Local averaging for fast handoffs in cellular networks,"Brian L Mark, Alexe E Leu",2007/3/19,Journal IEEE Transactions On Wireless Communications,"We propose a local averaging technique for processing the received pilot signal strength, which can significantly improve handoff performance in cellular networks. In handoff algorithms, the received pilot signal strength is typically averaged to diminish the undesirable effect of the fast fading component. Unfortunately, the averaging process can substantially alter the characteristics of path loss and shadowing components, causing increased handoff delay. The proposed local averaging method provides significant improvement for handoff delay performance, especially in the non-line-of-sight case, when the mobile station turns around a corner. An important feature of local averaging is that the handoff performance is insensitive to the speed of the mobile station, such that velocity estimation is not needed.

Important examples of continuoustime bivariate Markov chains include the Markov modulated Poisson process, and the batch Markovian arrival process. A hidden Markov model with finite alphabet is an example of a discrete-time bivariate Markov chain. In the third class we have diffusion processes observed in Brownian motion, and diffusion processes modulating the rate of a Poisson process. Bivariate Markov processes play central roles in the theory and applications of estimation, control, queuing, biomedical engineering, and reliability. We review properties of bivariate Markov processes, recursive estimation of their statistics, and recursive and iterative parameter estimation.",31

To recapture the so-called “spectrum holes,” various schemes for allowing unlicensed or secondary users to opportunistically access unused spectrum have been proposed. Opportunistic or dynamic spectrum access is achieved by cognitive radios that are capable of sensing the radio environment for spectrum holes and dynamically tuning to different frequency channels to access them.

The multipath routing scheme consists of an algorithm to determine a set of multiple disjoint or partially disjoint paths and a mechanism for distributing traffic over a multipath route to reduce the traffic load on a congested link. The algorithm for finding multipath routes is based on shortest path routing and does not require pre-establishment of paths or support for source routing. The mechanism for multipath traffic distribution is triggered at a node when the average load on an outgoing link exceeds a threshold.

Distributed Mobility Tracking for Ad Hoc Networks Based on an Autoregressive Model.,"Zainab R Zaidi, Brian L Mark",2004/12/7,Conference IWDC,"In ad hoc networks, node mobility causes the network topology to change dynamically over time, which complicates important tasks such as routing and flow control. We propose a distributed scheme for accurately and efficiently tracking the mobility of nodes in ad hoc networks. A first-order autoregressive model is used to represent the evolution of the mobility state of each node, which consists of position, velocity, and acceleration. Each node uses an extended Kalman filter to estimate its mobility state by incorporating network-based signal measurements and the position estimates of the neighbor nodes. Neighbor nodes exchange their position estimates periodically by means of HELLO packets. Each node re-estimates its mobility model parameters, allowing the scheme to adapt to changing mobility characteristics. In practice, a small number of reference nodes with known coordinates is required for accurate …",9

Such a scheme could be used to provide smoother handoffs by enabling handoff procedures and pre-allocation of resources to be initiated prior to the actual handoff event. The handoff trigger scheme uses mobility information to predict the occurrence of a handoff event, i.e. the event when the pilot signal strength received from the target base station exceeds that received from the current base station by a given hysteresis level. The handoff trigger scheme is derived from a mobility estimation and prediction scheme, which is based on an autoregressive model or mobility. Simulation results show that the handoff trigger scheme can provide a non-trivial trigger interval with low probabilities of false alarm and missed detection.",9
Efficient simulation of the national airspace system,"John F Shortle, D Gross, Briam L Mark",2003/12/7,Journal WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE,"The National Airspace System (NAS) is a large and complicated system. Detailed simulation models of the NAS are generally quite slow, so it can be difficult to obtain statistically valid samples from such models. This paper presents two methods for reducing the complexity of such networks to improve simulation time. One method is removal of low-utilization queues - that is, replacing a queueing node with a delay node, so that airplanes experience a service time at the node but no queueing time. The other is removal of nodes by clustering - that is, where groups of nodes are collapsed into a single node. We employ the methods on simple networks and show that the reductions yield very little loss in modeling accuracy. We provide some estimates for the potential speedup in simulation time when using the methods on large networks.",9
Exploiting multiuser diversity for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks,"Tuan T Do, Brian L Mark",2010/1/10,Conference 2010 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS),"We consider wireless system consisting of secondary users equipped with cognitive radios that attempt to access radio spectrum that is not being used by the primary licensed users.

We design and analyze a stochastic traffic regulator that can be used in conjunction with results from stochastic network calculus to provide probabilistic guarantees on end-to-end network delay. Two alternative implementations of the stochastic regulator are developed and …",3
Game-theoretic framework for cooperative relaying in cognitive radio networks,"Zheng Wang, Brian L Mark",2020/6/7,Conference ICC 2020-2020 IEEE international conference on communications (ICC),"We propose a novel Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to jointly manage spectrum resources and coordinate secondary users in a cognitive radio network with decode-and-forward cooperative relaying capability to extend coverage. The primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) are mapped into leader-follower pairs in which the SUs purchase spectrum resources from their corresponding PU leaders. An optimal SU transmit strategy incorporating cooperative relaying is derived, and a hybrid scheduling algorithm incorporating both direct transmission and relay transmission is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed Stackelberg game framework can achieve significantly better system performance with cooperative relaying compared to an SU direct transmission scheme.",3

Upper bound on false alarm rate for landmine detection and classification using syntactic pattern recognition,"Ahmed O Nasif, Brian L Mark, Kenneth J Hintz, Nathalia Peixoto",2010/4/29,"Conference Detection and Sensing of Mines, Explosive Objects, and Obscured Targets XV","Recently, there has been considerable interest in the development of robust, cost-effective and high performance non-metallic landmine detection systems using ground penetrating radar (GPR). Many of the available solutions try to discriminate landmines from clutter by extracting some form of statistical or geometrical information from the raw GPR data, and oftentimes, it is difficult to assess the performance of such systems without performing extensive field experiments. In our approach, a landmine is characterized by a binary-valued string corresponding to its impedance discontinuity profile in the depth direction.

Reducing ASE effect in coherent detection by employing double-pass fiber preamplifier and time-domain filter,"Youming Chen, Brian L Mark, Ralph Burnham, Horacio Verdun",2009/9/25,Journal IEEE journal of quantum electronics,"We report on a novel fiber based coherent detection system employing a double-pass fiber preamplifier, a spectral bandpass filter, and a time-domain filter.

RTF devices present suggested velocities based on the traffic signal timing data, such that if a traveler conformed to the suggested velocities and other travel-related data, the traveler would position himself into a geographic region on a roadway in which the traveler is ensured to avoid red lights and other traffic impediments. The server is operatively connected to traffic controllers and receives traffic light state data. The server facilitates a plurality of geographic regions based at least on the traffic light state data and detected travelers on roadways, wherein each of the geographic regions are synchronized to allow continuous traffic flow for the travelers positioned therein.",
"M. Kordi Boroujeny and BL Mark,"" A Framework for Providing Stochastic Delay Guarantees in Communication Networks,"" IEEE ICC 2021 Workshop on Time-sensitive and Deterministic …","Massieh Kordi Boroujeny, Brian L Mark",2021/6,Journal IEEE ICC 2021 Workshop on Time-sensitive and Deterministic Networking,"The provisioning of delay guarantees in packet-switched networks such as the Internet remains an important, yet challenging open problem. We propose and evaluate a framework, based on results from stochastic network calculus, for guaranteeing stochastic bounds on network delay at a statistical multiplexer. The framework consists of phase-type traffic bounds and moment generating function traffic envelopes, stochastic traffic regulators to enforce the traffic bounds, and an admission control scheme to ensure that a stochastic delay bound is maintained for a given set of flows. Through numerical examples, we show that a stochastic delay bound is maintained at the multiplexer, and contrast the proposed framework to an approach based on deterministic network calculus.",
Real-Time Traffic Characterization for Quality-of-Service Control in ATM Networks,"Brian L Mark, Gopalakrishnan Ramamurthy",2020/4/1,Book High-Performance Backbone Network Technology,"One of the important challenges in the design of ATM networks is how to provide quality-of-service (QoS) while maintaining high network resource utilization. In this paper, we discuss the role of real-time traffic characterization in QoS control for ATM networks and review several approaches to the problem of resource allocation. We then describe a particular framework for QoS control in which real-time measurements of a connection stream are used to determine appropriate parameters for usage parameter control (UPC). Connection admission control (CAC) is based on the characterization of the aggregate stream in terms of the individual stream UPC descriptors, together with real-time measurements. key words: traffic characterization, quality-of-service, resource allocation, congestion control",
What probability distribution describes search?,"Melvin Friedman, Brian L Mark, Frank Skirlo",2019/9/1,Journal Optical Engineering,"Typically, search research papers assume that target acquisition is described by an exponential distribution. We investigate when this assumption is valid. It is obvious that two people are more effective than one person at finding a target, but how can that be quantified? The network imaging sensor (NIS) and time-dependent search parameter (TDSP) models quantify how much more effective multiple observers are at finding a target than a single individual for a wide variety of scenarios. We reference and summarize evidence supporting the NIS and TDSP models and demonstrate how NIS model results can be expressed in terms of a reduced hyperexponential distribution for scenarios where observer and target are stationary. Target acquisition probabilities are determined by analysis and confirmed by computer simulations and perception experiments. Search by multiple stationary observers looking for a …",
Gaussian random field approximation for exclusion zones in cognitive radio networks,"Zheng Wang, Brian L Mark",2017/10/8,"Conference 2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","To protect primary users from interference caused by secondary users (SUs) in a cognitive radio network, a geographic area called an exclusion zone can be defined in which SUs are prohibited from transmitting using a specified spectrum band. We propose a Gaussian Random Field Model (GRFM) framework for determining an exclusion zone with the desired properties in practical scenarios where analytical specifications may not be available. Based on the GRFM, we derive the radius of a disk determining the exclusion zone, assuming that the SUs are distributed geographically over a planar coverage area. Using measurement data obtained from SUs, the GRFM is applied to approximate the equivalent received signal power and aggregate interference at specified locations. Simulation results show that the GRFM approximation yields an accurate characterization of the exclusion zone. 1",

Binary Multi-Level Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,"Anatoliy Zinovyev, Brian L Mark",2016/4/19,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.05430,"Routing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) presents a big challenge, especially when support for a large number of nodes is needed. This paper extends the local visibility concept of the recent DHT-based URBAN_XOR routing protocol, which aims to reduce routing table sizes while keeping efficiency high. Our main contribution is providing a guarantee that if any two nodes are connected through other nodes, they are able to communicate with each other. We propose a new route acquisition method that aims to reduce the total amount of overhead traffic and improve convergence rate. In addition, we introduce an abstraction for describing the network structure that makes it easy to understand and analyze. Compared to existing approaches in ad hoc routing, the new protocol supports the following features: scalability, guaranteed connectivity assuming network convergence, absence of single points of failure, low path-stretch, and mobility.",

Secure and reliable handling of packets by the intermediate nodes is difficult to ensure in an ad hoc environment. We propose a trust establishment scheme for MANETs which aims to improve the reliability of packet forwarding over multi-hop routes in the presence of potentially malicious nodes. Each node forms an"" opin-ion"" about each of the other nodes based on both first and second-hand observation data collected from the network. The opinion metric can be incorporated into ad hoc rout-ing protocols to achieve reliable packet delivery even when a portion of the network exhibits malicious behavior.

Peakedness of stochastic models for high-speed network traffic,"Brian L Mark, DL Jagerman, G Ramamurthy",1995/9/17,Conference Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory,"In networks based on the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), information is transmitted asynchronously over high-speed links in the form of 53-byte units called cells. Accurate traffic characterization is a crucial step in performing network resource allocation and dimensioning. Peakedness was originally developed by teletraffic engineers as a tool for characterizing call arrival processes at a trunk group. We generalize the peakedness theory to include a class of stochastic models used in studies of high-speed networks and apply it to the approximate analysis of a statistical multiplexer.",
Virtual channel and path allocation in ATM networks,"Brian L Mark, Hisashi Kobayashi",1995/7/3,Conference Proceedings of IEEE Singapore International Conference on Networks and International Conference on Information Engineering'95,An asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network provides a connection-oriented service by establishing a virtual channel (VC) between a source and destination node. Virtual paths (VPs) facilitate virtual channel allocation by partitioning network resources along pre-calculated routes. This paper proposes a framework for the allocation of VCs and VPs in an ATM network. Our approach is based on approximating the required resources of calls and then formulating a multirate loss network model for an ATM network. We propose a decentralized algorithm for adaptively adjusting offered loads to network routes and VP bandwidth assignments.,

Models for Frequency Doppler Shift Prediction for LEO Satellites at L-Band,"Omid Nia, Brian L Mark","In low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communications, frequency Doppler shift (FDS) results in lower or higher received frequency than the signal initially transmitted from the satellite. To maintain high throughput and low bit error rate, FDS compensation methods are needed. Such methods rely on the accurate prediction of FDS. In this paper, we study and evaluate four models for frequency Doppler shift prediction in the LEO constellation at L-Band frequency using both simulation and experimental measurements from the Iridium NEXT constellation. Two models are from the literature and two new models are introduced here. The two new models differ from the existing models by estimating the earth’s central angle using multiple factors, ie, the slant ranges for different elevation angles and the coordinates of both the satellite and the earth station.

Spectrum Sensing with SS-AOA Measurements and Directional Transmissions,"Ahmed O Nasif, Brian L Mark","For successful opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) using spatial information, accurate localization is a crucial first step. In this paper, we consider a group of unlicensed (secondary) nodes that collaboratively localize a target licensed (primary) transmitter.

Such a localization scheme may play an important role in the sensing mechanisms of cognitive radios employing OSA, which is seen as a promising approach to solving the problem of spectrum scarcity. Numerical results show that when only a handful of SS measurements are available, a considerable accuracy improvement is possible by using just one or two line-of-sight AOA measurements.

Finally, the prospect of directional secondary transmissions is considered by characterizing the orientation and width of the transmission lobes of the secondary antenna’s beam pattern.","Scholar articles Spectrum Sensing with SS-AOA Measurements and Directional TransmissionsAO Nasif, BL MarkRelated articles All 4 versions ","For successful opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) using spatial information, accurate localization is a crucial first step.
