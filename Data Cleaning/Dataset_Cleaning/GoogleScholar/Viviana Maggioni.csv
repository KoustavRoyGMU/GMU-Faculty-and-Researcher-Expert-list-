A Review of Merged High Resolution Satellite Precipitation Product Accuracy During the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) - Era,"Viviana Maggioni, Patrick Meyers, Monique Robinson",2016,Journal Journal of Hydrometeorology,"A great deal of expertise in satellite precipitation estimation has been developed during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) era (1998–2015). The quantification of errors associated with satellite precipitation products (SPPs) is crucial for a correct use of these datasets in hydrological applications, climate studies, and water resources management. This study presents a review of previous work that focused on validating SPPs for liquid precipitation during the TRMM era through comparisons with surface observations, both in terms of mean errors and detection capabilities across different regions of the world. Several SPPs have been considered: TMPA 3B42 (research and real-time products), CPC morphing technique (CMORPH), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP; both the near-real-time and the Motion Vector Kalman filter products), PERSIANN, and PERSIANN–Cloud Classification …",335
On the performance of satellite precipitation products in riverine flood modeling: A review,"Viviana Maggioni, Christian Massari",2018,Journal Journal of Hydrology,"This work is meant to summarize lessons learned on using satellite precipitation products for riverine flood modeling and to propose future directions in this field of research. Firstly, the most common satellite precipitation products (SPPs) during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) eras are reviewed. Secondly, we discuss the main errors and uncertainty sources in these datasets that have the potential to affect streamflow and runoff model simulations. Thirdly, past studies that focused on using SPPs for predicting streamflow and runoff are analyzed. As the impact of floods depends not only on the characteristics of the flood itself, but also on the characteristics of the region (population density, land use, geophysical and climatic factors), a regional analysis is required to assess the performance of hydrologic models in monitoring and predicting floods.

Modeling errors in daily precipitation measurements: Additive or multiplicative?,"Yudong Tian, George J Huffman, Robert F Adler, Ling Tang, Mathew Sapiano, Viviana Maggioni, Huan Wu",2013/5/28,Journal Geophysical Research Letters,"The definition and quantification of uncertainty depend on the error model used. For uncertainties in precipitation measurements, two types of error models have been widely adopted: the additive error model and the multiplicative error model. This leads to incompatible specifications of uncertainties and impedes intercomparison and application. In this letter, we assess the suitability of both models for satellite‐based daily precipitation measurements in an effort to clarify the uncertainty representation. Three criteria were employed to evaluate the applicability of either model: (1) better separation of the systematic and random errors; (2) applicability to the large range of variability in daily precipitation; and (3) better predictive skills. It is found that the multiplicative error model is a much better choice under all three criteria. It extracted the systematic errors more cleanly, was more consistent with the large variability of …",158

Effects of resolution of satellite-based rainfall estimates on hydrologic modeling skill at different scales,"Humberto Vergara, Yang Hong, Jonathan J Gourley, Emmanouil N Anagnostou, Viviana Maggioni, Dimitrios Stampoulis, Pierre-Emmanuel Kirstetter",2014/4,Journal Journal of Hydrometeorology,"             Uncertainty due to resolution of current satellite-based rainfall products is believed to be an important source of error in applications of hydrologic modeling and forecasting systems. A method to account for the input’s resolution and to accurately evaluate the hydrologic utility of satellite rainfall estimates is devised and analyzed herein. A radar-based Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE) rainfall product (4 km, 1 h) was utilized to assess the impact of resolution of precipitation products on the estimation of rainfall and subsequent simulation of streamflow on a cascade of basins ranging from approximately 500 to 5000 km             2             .

Characteristics and Diurnal Cycle of GPM Rainfall Estimates over the Central Amazon Region,"Rômulo Oliveira, Viviana Maggioni, Daniel Vila, Carlos Morales",2016/6/25,Journal remote sensing,"Studies that investigate and evaluate the quality, limitations and uncertainties of satellite rainfall estimates are fundamental to assure the correct and successful use of these products in applications, such as climate studies, hydrological modeling and natural hazard monitoring. Over regions of the globe that lack in situ observations, such studies are only possible through intensive field measurement campaigns, which provide a range of high quality ground measurements, e.g., CHUVA (Cloud processes of tHe main precipitation systems in Brazil: A contribUtion to cloud resolVing modeling and to the GlobAl Precipitation Measurement) and GoAmazon (Observations and Modeling of the Green Ocean Amazon) over the Brazilian Amazon during 2014/2015.

The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) and the Goddard Profiling Algorithm—Version 2014 (GPROF2014) algorithms are evaluated against ground-based radar observations. Specifically, the S-band weather radar from the Amazon Protection National System (SIPAM), is first validated against the X-band CHUVA radar and then used as a reference to evaluate GPM precipitation. Results showed satisfactory agreement between S-band SIPAM radar and both IMERG and GPROF2014 algorithms.

Evaluating the uncertainty of terrestrial water budget components over high mountain Asia,"Yeosang Yoon, Sujay V Kumar, Barton A Forman, Benjamin F Zaitchik, Yonghwan Kwon, Yun Qian, Summer Rupper, Viviana Maggioni, Paul Houser, Dalia Kirschbaum, Alexandra Richey, Anthony Arendt, David Mocko, Jossy Jacob, Soumendra Bhanja, Abhijit Mukherjee",2019/5/24,Journal Frontiers in earth science,"This study explores the uncertainties in terrestrial water budget estimation over High Mountain Asia (HMA) using a suite of uncoupled land surface model (LSM) simulations. The uncertainty in the water balance components of precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and terrestrial water storage (TWS) is significantly impacted by the uncertainty in the driving meteorology, with precipitation being the most important boundary condition. Ten gridded precipitation datasets along with a mix of model-, satellite-, and gauge-based products, are evaluated first to assess their suitability for LSM simulations over HMA. The datasets are evaluated by quantifying the systematic and random errors of these products as well as the temporal consistency of their trends. Though the broader spatial patterns of precipitation are generally well captured by the datasets, they differ significantly in their means and trends. In general, precipitation datasets that incorporate information from gauges are found to have higher accuracy with low Root Mean Square Errors and high correlation coefficient values. An ensemble of LSM simulations with selected subset of precipitation products is then used to produce the mean annual fluxes and their uncertainty over HMA in P, ET, and R to be 2.11 ± 0.45, 1.26 ± 0.11, and 0.85 ± 0.36 mm per day, respectively. The mean annual estimates of the surface mass (water) balance components from this model ensemble are comparable to global estimates from prior studies. However, the uncertainty/spread of P, ET, and R is significantly larger than the corresponding estimates from global studies. A comparison of ET, snow cover …",41

Daily IMERG products (early, late, final) and microwave-only (MW) and Infrared-only (IR) precipitation components are evaluated at four different spatial resolutions (0.5°, 1°, 2°, and 3°) during a 3-year study period (March 2014–February 2017). Their performance is assessed based on both categorical and continuous performance metrics, including correlation coefficient, probability of detection, success ratio, bias, and root mean square error (RMSE). A triple collocation analysis (TCA) is also presented to further investigate the performance of these satellite-based products. Overall, the IMERG products show an underestimation with respect to OceanRAIN. Rain events in OceanRAIN are correctly detected by all IMERG products ~80% of the times. IR estimates show relatively large errors and low correlations with OceanRAIN compared to the other products. On the other hand, the MW component performs better than other products in terms of both categorical and continuous statistics. TCA reveals that 3DPRD performs consistently better than OceanRAIN in terms of RMSE and coefficient of determination at all spatial resolutions. This work is part of a larger effort to validate GPM products over nontraditional regions such as oceans.",37

Rainfall observations over a 10-year period (2000-2009) from a dense rain gauge network in the region are used as reference precipitation. A number of satellite precipitation error properties (probability of detection, false alarm rates, missed events, spatial correlation of the error, and hit biases) are investigated in terms of seasonality, satellite algorithm, rainfall intensity, gauge density, and temporal resolution dependencies.

Satellite rainfall estimates for debris flow prediction: an evaluation based on rainfall accumulation–duration thresholds,"EI Nikolopoulos, E Destro, V Maggioni, F Marra, M Borga",2017/8/1,Journal Journal of Hydrometeorology,"Rainfall thresholds are often used in early warning systems to identify rainfall conditions that, when reached or exceeded, are likely to result in debris flows. Rain gauges are typically used for the definition of these thresholds. However, in mountainous areas in situ observations are often sparse or nonexistent. Satellite-based rainfall estimates offer a solution to overcome the coverage problem at the global scale but are associated with significant estimation uncertainty. Evaluating satellite-based rainfall thresholds is thus necessary to understand their potential and limitations. In this work, an intercomparison among satellite-based precipitation products is presented in the context of estimating rainfall thresholds for debris flow prediction. The study is performed for the upper Adige River basin in the eastern Italian Alps during 2000–10. Large differences are observed between event-based characteristics (event duration …",30

For instance, in some regions in Africa the gauge density is often less than one station per 10 000 km2. The availability of rainfall data provided by gauges is also not always guaranteed in near real time or with a timeliness suited for agricultural and water resource management applications, as gauges are also subject to malfunctions and regulations imposed by national authorities. A potential alternative is satellite-based rainfall estimates, yet comparisons with in situ data suggest they are often not optimal.  In this study, we developed a short-latency (i.e. 2–3 d) rainfall product derived from the combination of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) Early Run (IMERG-ER) with multiple-satellite soil-moisture-based rainfall products derived from ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer), SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) L3 (Level 3) satellite soil moisture (SM) retrievals. We tested the performance of this product over four regions characterized by high-quality ground-based rainfall datasets (India, the conterminous United States, Australia and Europe) and over data-scarce regions in Africa and South America by using triple-collocation (TC) analysis.

The impact of model and rainfall forcing errors on characterizing soil moisture uncertainty in land surface modeling,"V Maggioni, EN Anagnostou, RH Reichle",2013/1/1,Journal Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci.,"The contribution of rainfall forcing errors relative to model (structural and parameter) uncertainty in the prediction of soil moisture is investigated by integrating the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM), forced with hydro-meteorological data, in the Oklahoma region. Rainfall-forcing uncertainty is introduced using a stochastic error model that generates ensemble rainfall fields from satellite rainfall products. The ensemble satellite rain fields are propagated through CLSM to produce soil moisture ensembles. Errors in CLSM are modeled with two different approaches: either by perturbing model parameters (representing model parameter uncertainty) or by adding randomly generated noise (representing model structure and parameter uncertainty) to the model prognostic variables. Our findings highlight that the method currently used in the NASA GEOS-5 Land Data Assimilation System to perturb CLSM variables poorly describes the uncertainty in the predicted soil moisture, even when combined with rainfall model perturbations. On the other hand, by adding model parameter perturbations to rainfall forcing perturbations, a better characterization of uncertainty in soil moisture simulations is observed. Specifically, an analysis of the rank histograms shows that the most consistent ensemble of soil moisture is obtained by combining rainfall and model parameter perturbations. When rainfall forcing and model prognostic perturbations are added, the rank histogram shows a U-shape at the domain average scale, which corresponds to a lack of variability in the forecast ensemble.

The S-band Amazon Protection National System (SIPAM) radar is used as reference and the Precipitation Uncertainties for Satellite Hydrology (PUSH) framework is adopted to characterize uncertainties associated with the satellite precipitation product. PUSH is calibrated and validated for the study region and takes into account factors like seasonality and surface type (i.e., land and river). Results demonstrated that the PUSH model is suitable for characterizing errors in the IMERG algorithm when compared with S-band SIPAM radar estimates. PUSH could efficiently predict the satellite rainfall error distribution in terms of spatial and intensity distribution. However, an underestimation (overestimation) of light satellite rain rates was observed during the dry (wet) period, mainly over rivers. Although the estimated error showed a lower standard deviation than the observed error, the correlation between satellite and radar rainfall was high and the systematic error was well captured along the Negro, Solimões, and Amazon rivers, especially during the wet season.",25

Two different sets of DA experiments are conducted: (1) the assimilation of a satellite-derived snow cover map (MOD10A1) and (2) the assimilation of the NASA MEaSUREs landscape freeze/thaw product from 2007 to 2008. The performance of the snow cover assimilation is evaluated via comparisons with available remote sensing-based snow water equivalent product and ground-based snow depth measurements. For example, in the comparison against ground-based snow depth measurements, the majority of the stations (13 of 14) show slightly improved goodness-of-fit statistics as a result of the snow DA, but only four are statistically significant. In addition, comparisons to the satellite-based land surface temperature products (MOD11A1 and MYD11A1) show that freeze/thaw DA yields improvements (at certain grid cells) of up to 0.58 K in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and 0.77 K in the absolute bias (relative to model-only simulations).

However, precipitation estimates from rain gauges, ground-based radars, satellite sensors, and numerical models are affected by significant uncertainties, which can be amplified when exposed to highly non-linear land model physics. This work tests the hypothesis that precipitation data from different sources can be optimally merged to minimize the hydrologic response error in surface soil moisture simulations and maximize their correlation with ground observations (multi-objective optimization problem). This hypothesis is tested by merging three precipitation products (one satellite product, a ground-based dataset, and model-base estimates) that force a land surface model trained …",20

Investigating water quality data using principal component analysis and granger causality,"Maryam Zavareh, Viviana Maggioni, Vadim Sokolov",2021/1/30,Journal Water,"This work investigates the inter-relationships among stream water quality indicators, hydroclimatic variables (e.g., precipitation, river discharge), and land characteristics (e.g., soil type, land use), which is crucial to developing effective methods for water quality protection. The potential of using statistical tools, such as Principal Component (PC) and Granger causality analyses, for this purpose is assessed across 10 watersheds in the Eastern United States. The PC analysis shows consistency across the ten locations, with most of the variation explained by the first two PCs, except for the least developed watershed that presents three PCs. Results show that stronger Granger causality relationships and correlation coefficients are identified when considering a lag of one day, compared to longer lags. This is mainly due to the watersheds’ limited size and, thus, their fast hydrological response. The strongest Granger causalities are observed when water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration are considered as the effect of the other variables, which corroborates the importance of these two water properties. This work also demonstrates how watershed size and land use can impact causalities between hydrometeorological variables and water quality, thus, highlighting how complex these relationships are even in a region characterized by overall similar climatology.",11

This work attempts to uncover the associations among various climatic and environmental variables and the annual malaria parasite incidence in the Peruvian region of Loreto. A Multilevel Mixed-effects Poisson Regression model is employed, focusing on the 2009–2013 period, when trends in malaria incidence shifted from decreasing to increasing.

The learning module is intended for junior/senior undergraduate students or junior graduate students with no (or little) prior experience in remote sensing, but with some basic background of environmental science, hydrology, statistics, and programming. This e-learning environment offers background content on the fundamentals of remote sensing, but also integrates a set of existing online tools for visualization and analysis of satellite observations. Specifically, students are introduced to a variety of satellite products and techniques that can be used to monitor and analyze changes in the hydrological cycle. At completion of the module, students are able to visualize remote sensing data (both in terms of time series and spatial maps), detect temporal trends, interpret satellite images, and assess errors and uncertainties in a remote sensing product. Students are given the opportunity to check their understanding as they progress through the module and also tackle complex real-life problems using remote sensing observations that professionals and scientists commonly use in practice.

A multi-sensor approach for high resolution airborne soil moisture mapping,"Viviana Maggioni, Rocco Panciera, Jeffrey P Walker, Marco Rinaldi, Valerio Paruscio, Jetse D Kalma, Edward J Kim",2006/12/4,Journal Proceedings 30th Hydrology and Water Resources Symposium,"Airborne remote sensing provides a viable option for high resolution mapping of nearsurface soil moisture that allows larger areas to be covered in greater spatial and temporal detail than has hereto been possible from traditional ground based techniques. However, the current retrieval algorithms require information on near-surface soil temperature and vegetation water content in order to estimate the soil moisture from well calibrated horizontally polarised passive microwave data. This paper presents a methodology for retrieving this ancillary data, through relationships with other remote sensing data. Near-surface soil temperature is estimated from land cover specific relationships with thermal infrared data, and vegetation water content is estimated from land cover specific relationships with near-and shortwave-infrared data. The methodology is tested with data from the National Airborne Field Experiment (NAFE) conducted in the Goulburn River catchment in New South Wales Australia, during November 2005. This intensive month-long field campaign involved daily airborne flights with a Polarimetric L-band Multibeam Radiometer (PLMR) and thermal imager flown onboard a small environmental aircraft at altitudes ranging from 150m to 3000m AGL, yielding passive microwave data at resolutions from 62.5 m across entire farms to 1km across entire regions.

A daily/25 km short-latency rainfall product for data scarce regions based on the integration of the GPM IMERG Early Run with multiple satellite soil moisture products,"Christian Massari, Luca Brocca, Thierry Pellarin, Gab Abramowitz, Paolo Filippucci, Luca Ciabatta, Viviana Maggioni, Yann Kerr, Diego Fernandez Prieto",2019,Publisher Copernicus GmbH,"Rain gauges are unevenly spaced around the world with extremely low gauge density over developing countries. For instance, in some regions in Africa the gauge density is often less than one station per 10 000 km2. The availability of rainfall data provided by gauges is also not always guaranteed in near real time or with a timeliness suited for agricultural and water resource management applications as gauges are also subject to malfunctions and regulations imposed by national authorities. A potential alternative are satellite-based rainfall estimates, yet comparisons with in-situ data suggest they're often not optimal. In this study, we developed a short-latency (i.e., 2–3 days) rainfall product derived from the combination of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM early run (IMERG-ER) with multiple satellite soil moisture-based rainfall products derived from ASCAT, SMOS and SMAP L3 satellite soil moisture (SM) retrievals. We tested the performance of this product over four regions characterized by high quality ground-based rainfall datasets (India, Conterminous United States, Australia and Europe) and over data scarce regions in Africa and South America by using Triple Collocation analysis (TC). We found the integration of satellite SM observations with in-situ rainfall observations is very beneficial with improvements of IMERG-ER up to 20 % and 40 % in terms of correlation and error, respectively, and a generalized enhancement in terms of categorical scores with the integrated product often outperforming reanalysis and ground-based long latency datasets.

Application of Rough Set Theory to Water Quality Analysis: a Case Study,"Maryam Zavareh, Viviana Maggioni",2018/11,Journal Data,"This work proposes an approach to analyze water quality data that is based on rough set theory. Six major water quality indicators (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, specific conductivity, and nitrate concentration) were collected at the outlet of the watershed that contains the George Mason University campus in Fairfax, VA during three years (October 2015–December 2017). Rough set theory is applied to monthly averages of the collected data to estimate one indicator (decision attribute) based on the remainder indicators and to determine what indicators (conditional attributes) are essential (core) to predict the missing indicator. The redundant attributes are identified, the importance degree of each attribute is quantified, and the certainty and coverage of any detected rule(s) is evaluated. Possible decision making rules are also assessed and the certainty coverage factor is calculated. Results show that the core water quality indicators for the Mason watershed during the study period are turbidity and specific conductivity. Particularly, if pH is chosen as a decision attribute, the importance degree of turbidity is higher than the one of conductivity. If the decision attribute is turbidity, the only indispensable attribute is specific conductivity and if specific conductivity is the decision attribute, the indispensable attribute beside turbidity is temperature.",8

Data assimilation of terrestrial water storage observations to estimate precipitation fluxes: a synthetic experiment,"Manuela Girotto, Rolf Reichle, Matthew Rodell, Viviana Maggioni",2021/3/23,Journal Remote Sensing,"The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and its Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission provide unprecedented observations of terrestrial water storage (TWS) dynamics at basin to continental scales. Established GRACE data assimilation techniques directly adjust the simulated water storage components to improve the estimation of groundwater, streamflow, and snow water equivalent. Such techniques artificially add/subtract water to/from prognostic variables, thus upsetting the simulated water balance. To overcome this limitation, we propose and test an alternative assimilation scheme in which precipitation fluxes are adjusted to achieve the desired changes in simulated TWS. Using a synthetic data assimilation experiment, we show that the scheme improves performance skill in precipitation estimates in general, but that it is more robust for snowfall than for rainfall, and it fails in certain regions with strong horizontal gradients in precipitation. The results demonstrate that assimilation of TWS observations can help correct (adjust) the model’s precipitation forcing and, in turn, enhance model estimates of TWS, snow mass, soil moisture, runoff, and evaporation. A key limitation of the approach is the assumption that all errors in TWS originate from errors in precipitation. Nevertheless, the proposed approach produces more consistent improvements in simulated runoff than the established GRACE data assimilation techniques.",7

The joint assimilation of remotely sensed leaf area index and surface soil moisture into a land surface model,"Azbina Rahman, Viviana Maggioni, Xinxuan Zhang, Paul Houser, Timothy Sauer, David M Mocko",2022/1,Journal Remote Sensing,"This work tests the hypothesis that jointly assimilating satellite observations of leaf area index and surface soil moisture into a land surface model improves the estimation of land vegetation and water variables. An Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to test this hypothesis across the Contiguous United States from April 2015 to December 2018. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed for several modeled vegetation and water variables (evapotranspiration, net ecosystem exchange, and soil moisture) in terms of random errors and anomaly correlation coefficients against a set of independent validation datasets (ie, Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model, FLUXCOM, and International Soil Moisture Network). The results show that the assimilation of the leaf area index mostly improves the estimation of evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange, whereas the assimilation of surface soil moisture alone improves surface soil moisture content, especially in the western US, in terms of both root mean squared error and anomaly correlation coefficient. The joint assimilation of vegetation and soil moisture information combines the results of individual vegetation and soil moisture assimilations and reduces errors (and increases correlations with the reference datasets) in evapotranspiration, net ecosystem exchange, and surface soil moisture simulated by the land surface model. However, because soil moisture satellite observations only provide information on the water content in the top 5 cm of the soil column, the impact of the proposed data assimilation technique on root zone soil moisture is limited.

The influence of assimilating leaf area index in a land surface model on global water fluxes and storages,"Xinxuan Zhang, Viviana Maggioni, Azbina Rahman, Paul Houser, Yuan Xue, Timothy Sauer, Sujay Kumar, David Mocko",2020/7/24,Journal Hydrology and Earth System Sciences," Vegetation plays a fundamental role not only in the energy and carbon cycles but also in the global water balance by controlling surface evapotranspiration (ET). Thus, accurately estimating vegetation-related variables has the potential to improve our understanding and estimation of the dynamic interactions between the water, energy, and carbon cycles. This study aims to assess the extent to which a land surface model (LSM) can be optimized through the assimilation of leaf area index (LAI) observations at the global scale. Two observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are performed to evaluate the efficiency of assimilating LAI into an LSM through an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to estimate LAI, ET, canopy-interception evaporation (CIE), canopy water storage (CWS), surface soil moisture (SSM), and terrestrial water storage (TWS). Results show that the LAI data assimilation framework not only effectively reduces errors in LAI model simulations but also improves all the modeled water flux and storage variables considered in this study (ET, CIE, CWS, SSM, and TWS), even when the forcing precipitation is strongly positively biased (extremely wet conditions). However, it tends to worsen some of the modeled water-related variables (SSM and TWS) when the forcing precipitation is affected by a dry bias. This is attributed to the fact that the amount of water in the LSM is conservative, and the LAI assimilation introduces more vegetation, which requires more water than what is available within the soil.",6

Specifically, rainfall-forcing uncertainty is introduced using a stochastic error model that generates reference-like ensemble rainfall fields from satellite rainfall products. The ensemble satellite rain fields are propagated through CLSM to produce soil moisture ensembles. Errors in CLSM are modeled with 10 two different approaches: either by perturbing model parameters using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) technique or by adding randomly generated noise to the model prognostic variables. While the first method only addresses parametric uncertainty, the second one addresses both structural and parametric uncertainty. Despite this, a reasonable spread in soil moisture is achieved with relatively few 15 parameter perturbations through GLUE, whereas the same ensemble width requires stronger prognostic perturbations with the standard random perturbation method. The probability of encapsulating the reference soil moisture simulation increases when the rainfall forcing uncertainty and the model uncertainty approaches are combined (compared with using only rainfall uncertainty). This improvement is more significant when 20 using the GLUE technique …",5
Global Assimilation of Remotely Sensed Leaf Area Index: The Impact of Updating More State Variables Within a Land Surface Model,"Azbina Rahman, Xinxuan Zhang, Paul Houser, Timothy Sauer, Viviana Maggioni",2022/1/4,Journal Frontiers in Water,"As vegetation regulates water, carbon, and energy cycles from the local to the global scale, its accurate representation in land surface models is crucial. The assimilation of satellite-based vegetation observations in a land surface model has the potential to improve the estimation of global carbon and energy cycles, which in turn can enhance our ability to monitor and forecast extreme hydroclimatic events, ecosystem dynamics, and crop production. This work proposes the assimilation of a remotely sensed vegetation product (Leaf Area Index, LAI) within the Noah Multi-Parameterization land surface model using an Ensemble Kalman Filter technique. The impact of updating leaf mass along with LAI is also investigated. Results show that assimilating LAI data improves the estimation of transpiration and net ecosystem exchange, which is further enhanced by also updating the leaf mass. Specifically, transpiration anomaly correlation coefficients improve in about 77% and 66% of the global land area thanks to the assimilation of leaf area index with and without updating leaf mass, respectively. Random errors in transpiration are also reduced, with an improvement of the unbiased root mean square error in 70% (74%) of the total area without the update of leaf mass (with the update of leaf mass). Similarly, net ecosystem exchange anomaly correlation coefficients improve from 52% to 75% and random errors improve from 49% to 62% of the total pixels after the update of leaf mass. Better performances for both transpiration and net ecosystem exchange are observed across croplands, but the largest improvement is shown over forests and woodland. The …",4
Errors and uncertainties associated with quasiglobal satellite precipitation products,"Viviana Maggioni, Christian Massari, Chris Kidd",2022/1/1,Book Precipitation Science,"Measuring precipitation on a global scale is only possible from satellite platforms. Satellite precipitation estimates are based on geosynchronous infrared sensors on geostationary satellites, characterized by high sampling frequency, and polar-orbiting microwave sensors on low-Earth-orbiting satellites with less-frequent sampling. Assessing satellite product performance is fundamental to infer the reliability of such estimates and effectively use them in water resources management, extreme event characterization, disease control, or weather forecasting. Nevertheless, errors and uncertainties associated with satellite precipitation products are often masked due to temporal and spatial sampling, as well as bias corrections against a reference dataset. Moreover, the verification of satellite precipitation products is easier over land areas, where rain gauges and ground radars are available as benchmark but extremely …",4
Land use classification and analysis using radar data mining in Ethiopia,"Haile K Tadesse, John J Qu, Alonso A Aguirre, Maction Komba, Viviana Maggioni",2017/1/5,Journal International Journal of Advanced Remote Sensing and GIS,"Land use classification in tropical areas, is hindered by frequent cloud cover which limits the availability of optical satellite data. Satellite-borne radar is a possible alternative to optical data for land use classification in tropical areas. However, radar data is affected by noise (ie, speckle) that must be minimized before its use in land classification. Median, Lee-Sigma, and Gamma-MAP de-speckling techniques were applied to Fine Beam, Dual polarization (FBD) PALSAR radar data acquired over central Ethiopia. Each of the de-speckled images were then subjected to supervised classification using Maximum Likelihood, C4. 5, Multilayer Perceptron and Stacking techniques. Validation results indicated that de-speckling techniques improved classification accuracy by up to 25%, 20% and 16% using Gamma-MAP, Median and Lee-Sigma respectively. Gamma-MAP de-speckling in combination with the Multilayer perceptron classifier achieved the best overall classification accuracy at 91.2%. This study proved the importance of radar data as an alternative source of information for land use classification in the tropics. Further research should focus on the application of radar data for forest fire detection and crop classification. The use of fully polarized radar data has the potential to further improve the proposed land use classification in tropical countries.",4

Reliable estimates of uncertainty would mitigate this limitation, especially in near-real time when gauge observations are not available. Creating such estimates is challenging, however, due both to the complicated nature of satellite precipitation errors and to the lack of “ground truth” data precisely in the places—including oceans, complex terrain and developing countries—that could benefit most from satellite precipitation estimates. In this work, we use the GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) derived swath-based precipitation products as an alternative to ground-based observations to facilitate IMERG uncertainty estimation.

In addition, hourly land surface temperature (LST) from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system is also compared to FT classifications. Utilizing the higher spatial resolution temperatures (~5 km), we assess subgrid-scale variability and its relationship to coarser microwave FT classifications (>25 km).

Changes in water supply affect energy, industry, transportation, and ecosystems (agriculture, fisheries) and, as a result, also affect the social, environmental and economic fabrics of the region. Sustaining the highly interconnected food-energy-water nexus (FEWN) will be a fundamental and increasing challenge under a changing climate regime. High variability in topography and distribution of glaciated and snow-covered areas in the HMA region, and scarcity of high resolution (in-situ) data make it difficult to model and project climate change impacts on individual watersheds. We lack basic understanding of the spatial and temporal variations in climate, surface impurities in snow and ice such as black carbon and dust that alter surface albedo, and glacier mass balance and dynamics. These knowledge gaps create challenges in predicting where and when the impact of changes in river flow will be the most significant economically and ecologically. In response to these challenges, the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) established the High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT) in 2016 to conduct research to address knowledge gaps. This paper summarizes some of the advances HiMAT made over the past 5 years, highlights the scientific challenges in improving our understanding of the hydrology of the HMA region, and introduces an integrated assessment framework to assess the impacts of climate changes on the FEWN for the HMA region.

Investigating the error propagation from satellite-based input precipitation to output water quality indicators simulated by a hydrologic model,"Jennifer Solakian, Viviana Maggioni, Adil Godrej",2020/11/13,Journal Remote Sensing,"This study investigated the propagation of errors in input satellite-based precipitation products (SPPs) on streamflow and water quality indicators simulated by a hydrological model in the Occoquan Watershed, located in the suburban Washington, D.C. area. A dense rain gauge network was used as reference to evaluate three SPPs which are based on different retrieval algorithms. A Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) hydrology and water quality model was forced with the three SPPs to simulate output of streamflow (Q), total suspended solids (TSS), stream temperature (TW), and dissolved oxygen (DO). Results indicate that the HSPF model may have a dampening effect on the precipitation-to-streamflow error. The bias error propagation of all three SPPs showed a positive dependency on basin scale for streamflow and TSS, but not for TW and DO. On a seasonal basis, bias error propagation varied by product, with larger values generally found in fall and winter. This study demonstrated that the spatiotemporal variability of SPPs, along with their algorithms to estimate precipitation, have an influence on water quality simulations in a hydrologic model.",3
Evaluating the Applicability of the PUSH Framework to Quasi-Global Infrared Precipitation Retrievals at 0.5°/Daily Spatial/Temporal Resolution,"S Khan, V Maggioni",2020/11,Journal Asia-Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Sciences,"Error estimates associated with satellite precipitation retrievals are crucial to allow inferences about the reliability of such products in their operational applications. However, evaluating satellite precipitation error characteristics is challenging because of the inherent temporal and spatial variability of precipitation, measurement errors, and sampling uncertainties, especially at fine temporal and spatial resolutions. The aim of this study is to estimate errors associated with satellite-based infra-red (IR) precipitation retrievals quasi-globally (60°N − 60°S) over land. The error model adopted for this study is the Probability Uncertainty in Satellite Hydrology (PUSH) framework, which is calibrated and validated against the satellite-based Level-3 Dual frequency precipitation radar product at daily resolution (3DPRD) for different Koppen climate zones.

One approach to cope with these errors is to combine SMPs with ensemble generation methods, such that each ensemble member reflects one plausible realization of the true—but unknown—precipitation. This requires replicating the spatiotemporal autocorrelation structure of SMP errors. The climatology of this structure is unknown for most locations due to a lack of ground‐reference observations, while the unique anisotropy and nonstationarity within any particular precipitation system limit the relevance of this climatology to the depiction of individual storm systems.

Better understanding of past precipitation trends is crucial to examine changing precipitation extremes, optimize future water demands, stormwater infrastructure, extreme event measures, irrigation management, etc., especially if combined with future climate and population projections. The objective of the study is to investigate the spatial-temporal variability of average and extreme precipitation at a sub-regional scale, specifically in the southern mid-Atlantic United States, a region characterized by diverse topography and is among the fastest-growing areas in North America. Particularly, this work investigates past precipitation trends and patterns using the North American Land Data Assimilation System, Version 2 (NLDAS-2, 12 km/1hr resolution) reanalysis dataset during 1980-2018. Both parametric (linear regression) and nonparametric (e.g., Theil-Sen) robust statistical tools are employed in the study to analyze trend magnitudes, which are tested for statistical significance using the Mann-Kendall test. Standard precipitation indices from ETCCDI are also used to characterize trends in the relative contribution of extreme events to precipitation in the area. In the region, an increasing trend (4.3 mm/year) is identified in annual average precipitation with approximately 34% of the domain showing a significant increase (at the 0.1 significance level) of +3 to +5 mm/year.

After a brief overview of the various methods to measure precipitation from in situ observations, satellite platforms, and via model simulations, the chapter focuses on the statistical assumptions underlying the most common spatiotemporal and pattern-recognition techniques: stationarity, isotropy, and ergodicity. As the variability of Earth’s climate increases and the volume of observational data keeps growing, these assumptions may no longer be satisfied, and new mathematical methodologies may be required. The chapter discusses spatiotemporal decorrelation measures, a nonstationary intensity-duration-function, and 2-dimension reduction methodologies to address these challenges.",2

In situ observations are limited around the Earth, especially in remote areas (eg, complex terrain, dense vegetation), but currently available satellite precipitation products are able to provide global precipitation estimates with an accuracy that depends upon many factors (eg, type of storms, temporal sampling, season etc...). Recently, Brocca et al.(2014) have proposed an alternative approach (ie SM2RAIN) that allows to estimate rainfall from space by using satellite soil moisture observations. In contrast with classical satellite precipitation products which sense the cloud properties to retrieve the instantaneous precipitation, this new bottom-up approach makes use of two consecutive soil moisture measurements for obtaining an estimate of the fallen precipitation within the interval between two satellite passes. As a result, the nature of the measurement is different and complementary to the one of classical precipitation products and could provide a different valid perspective to improve current satellite rainfall estimates via appropriate integration between the products (ie SM2RAIN plus a classical satellite rainfall product). However, whether SM2RAIN is able or not to improve the performance of any state-of-the-art satellite rainfall product is much dependent upon an adequate quantification and characterization of the relative errors of the products.",2

Performance of Different Crop Models in Simulating Soil Temperature,"Janani Kandasamy, Yuan Xue, Paul Houser, Viviana Maggioni",2023/3/7,Journal Sensors,"Soil temperature is one of the key factors to be considered in precision agriculture to increase crop production. This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of a land surface model (Noah Multiparameterization (Noah-MP)) against a traditional crop model (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate Model (EPIC)) in estimating soil temperature. A sets of soil temperature estimates, including three different EPIC simulations (i.e., using different parameterizations) and a Noah-MP simulations, is compared to ground-based measurements from across the Central Valley in California, USA, during 2000–2019. The main conclusion is that relying only on one set of model estimates may not be optimal. Furthermore, by combining different model simulations, i.e., by taking the mean of two model simulations to reconstruct a new set of soil temperature estimates, it is possible to improve the performance of the single model in terms of different statistical metrics against the reference ground observations. Containing ratio (CR), Euclidean distance (dist), and correlation co-efficient (R) calculated for the reconstructed mean improved by 52%, 58%, and 10%, respectively, compared to both model estimates. Thus, the reconstructed mean estimates are shown to be more capable of capturing soil temperature variations under different soil characteristics and across different geographical conditions when compared to the parent model simulations.

Informing Improvements in Microwave Freeze/Thaw Products using High-Resolution Temperature Data Over North America,"Jeremy Johnston, Paul Houser, Viviana Maggioni",2022/11/24,Journal Authorea Preprints,"Existing global FT records, derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), the Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer (AMSR), and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) produce relatively course spatial resolution (25-36km) binary FT classifications. These classifications can vary widely depending on the microwave bands used, topography, and land cover, leading to a somewhat ambiguous definition of ‘frozen’ and ‘thawed’ states. In this study, we assess the relationship between satellite observation derived FT products over North America compared to modeled near-surface temperatures and land surface temperature (LST) from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (GOES). Utilizing the higher spatial resolution of these products (~4.5km), sub-grid scale variability and its relationship to courser microwave FT classifications was assessed. Through an analysis of spatial variability and uncertainty across North America, five focus study pixels each representing unique FT profiles were examined. These included pixels in: (1) Southern Plains (36, -97), (2) Tundra (61, -76), (3) Northern Forest (47, -74), (4) Northern Plains (52, -103), and Mountainous (38.9, -107.9). The model ensemble adequately captured near surface temperatures as they relate to FT classifications in Tundra, the Northern Plains, and Northern Forest regions. On average, 85.3% to 99.6% of sub-grid cells were below freezing when FT products classified the associated pixels as frozen. GOES - LST observations were shown to have the highest proportion of sub-grid cells below freezing on average, when classified as frozen by FT …",

To this end, this study systematically evaluates four sets of model simulations at point scale, basin scale, and domain scale obtained from different spatial resolutions including 0.01 degree (∼ 1-km) and 0.25 degree (∼ 25-km). The assessment is conducted via comparisons against ground-based observations and satellite-derived reference products. The key variables of interest include surface net shortwave radiation, surface net longwave radiation, skin temperature, near-surface soil temperature, snow depth, snow water equivalent, and total runoff. In the evaluation against ground-based measurements, the superiority of the 0.01 degree estimates are mostly demonstrated across relatively complex terrain. Specifically, hyper-resolution modeling improves the skill in meteorological forcing estimates (except precipitation) by 9% relative to coarse-resolution estimates. The model forced by downscaled forcings in its entirety yields the highest predictability skill in model output states as well as precipitation, which improves the skill obtained by coarse-resolution estimates by 7%. These findings, on one hand, corroborate the importance of employing the hyper-resolution versus coarse-resolution modeling in areas characterized by complex terrain. On the other hand, by evaluating four sets of model simulations forced with different precipitation products, this study emphasizes the importance of accurate hyper-resolution precipitation products to drive model simulations.",

"Investigating Rainfall Patterns in the Hubei Province, China and Northern Italy During the Covid-19 Lockdowns","Ridwana Binte Sharif, Paul Houser, Valentina Aquila, Viviana Maggioni",2022/1/21,Journal Frontiers in Climate,"In the spring of 2020, many countries enacted strict lockdowns to contain the spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), resulting in a sharp observed decrease in regional atmospheric pollutant concentrations, such as NOx and aerosols in early 2020. Atmospheric composition can influence cloud properties and might have a significant effect on the initiation of precipitation. This study investigated changes in precipitation patterns during COVID-19 lockdowns and compared them to patterns observed during the previous 19 years (2001 through 2019) across two regions of interest, the Hubei province in China and Northern Italy using a satellite-based precipitation dataset. Results indicated that overall rainfall averages were higher in the spring of 2020 with respect to their corresponding climatological means, with higher standard deviations especially in the more urbanized regions like Wuhan, China and Milan, Italy. Precipitation rates observed during the Spring of 2020 tend to fall outside of the climatological 25–75th percentile bounds. Similarly, the number of rainy pixels was in several cases in Spring 2020 higher than the climatological 75th percentile and sometimes even higher than the 95th one. These anomalies may be due to natural variations and may not be caused directly by the reduction in atmospheric pollutant concentrations. Nevertheless, our analysis proved that precipitation patterns during the lockdowns were on the extreme tails of the precipitation climatological distributions for both regions of interest. Lastly, decorrelation lags and distances in Northern Italy remained similar to their corresponding climatological values …",

Such intensification has direct implications for worsening floods and damage to life and property. This study investigates the projected trends (2015-2100) in precipitation climatology and daily extremes using Community Earth System Model Version 2 large ensemble (CESM2-LE) simulations at regional and seasonal scales. Specifically, future extreme precipitation is examined in National Climate Assessment (NCA) regions over the Contiguous United States using SSP3-7.0 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway). Extreme precipitation is analyzed in terms of daily maximum precipitation and simple daily intensity index (SDII) using Mann-Kendall (5% significance level) and Theil-Sen (TS) regression. The most substantial increases occur in the highest precipitation values (95th) during summer and winter clustered in the Midwest and Northeast, respectively, according to long-term extreme trends evaluated in quantiles (i.e., 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th). Seasonal climatology projections suggest wetting and drying patterns, with wetting in spring and winter in the eastern areas and drying during summer in the Midwest. Lower quantiles in the central U.S. are expected to remain unchanged, transitioning to wetting patterns in the fall due to heavier precipitation. Winter positive trends (at a 5% significance level) are most prevalent in the Northeast and Southeast, with an overall ensemble agreement on such trends. In spring, these trends are predominantly found in the Midwest. In the Northeast and Northern Great Plains, the …",

Directions in error modeling,"Viviana Maggioni, Christian Massari",2021,Publisher World Climate Research Programme,"Although in the recent past numerous attempts have been made to develop error models of satellite precipitation products, several issues limit their use in applications. First off, the majority of these approaches is based on assumptions regarding the distribution of precipitation and/or associated errors. Second, simple error models may be preferable for some applications, but more complex solutions may be more appropriate for others. For instance, hydrological models used to simulate floods should be particularly sensitive to extreme precipitation events and the ability of detecting such events. Thus, an error model that account for missed precipitation cases and false alarms would be preferable. Third, precipitation errors and uncertainties depend on seasonality, rain rate, geophysical features, and the product’s temporal and spatial resolutions. Thus, the same error model would unlikely perform similarly everywhere in the world, at any time, for any precipitation event type, and for any application.",

TWS is defined as the sum of groundwater, soil moisture, snow, surface water, ice and biomass water. Data assimilation of GRACE TWS observations has been shown to improve simulation of groundwater, streamflow, and snow water equivalent, and has also proven useful for drought monitoring and identifying human impacts on the water cycle. From a modeling perspective, the TWS components are defined as ""prognostic hydrological states"". Existing GRACE data assimilation schemes update these prognostic states directly. In this work, we propose an alternate approach in which precipitation fluxes are adjusted in order to achieve the desired change in the hydrological prognostic states. Limitations of such an approach include the assumption that all errors in TWS originate from errors in precipitation. Nonetheless, benefits comprise (1) the water balance is maintained, as opposed to having to add increments to the water budget components, (2) the model automatically determines how to distribute the updates among the TWS prognostic states, and (3) it is not necessary to know the exact time of the observation TWS, because the TWS change timing is determined by the precipitation forcing.",

An Error Model for Uncertainty Quantification in High-Time-Resolution Precipitation Products,"Yudong Tian, Mathew RP Sapiano, Viviana Maggioni, Robert F Adler, George J Huffman",2014/6/1,"Description Description This study proposes a new framework, Precipitation Uncertainties for Satellite Hydrology (PUSH), to provide time-varying, global estimates of errors for high-time-resolution, multisatellite precipitation products using a technique calibrated with high-quality validation data.

An Error Model for High-Time Resolution Satellite Precipitation Products,"V Maggioni, M Sapiano, RF Adler, GJ Huffman, Y Tian",2013/12,Journal AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,"A new error scheme (PUSH: Precipitation Uncertainties for Satellite Hydrology) is presented to provide global estimates of errors for high time resolution, merged precipitation products. Errors are estimated for the widely used Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42 product at daily/0.25 resolution, using the high quality NOAA CPC-UNI gauge analysis as the benchmark. Each of the following four scenarios is explored and explicitly modeled: correct no-precipitation detection (both satellite and gauges detect no precipitation), missed precipitation (satellite records a zero, but it is incorrect), false alarm (satellite detects precipitation, but the reference is zero), and hit (both satellite and gauges detect precipitation).

Modeling errors in daily precipitation measurements: Additive or multiplicative?,"Yudong Tian, George J Huffman, Robert F Adler, Ling Tang, Mathew Sapiano, Viviana Maggioni, Huan Wu",2013/5/28,Journal Geophysical Research Letters,"The definition and quantification of uncertainty depend on the error model used. For uncertainties in precipitation measurements, two types of error models have been widely adopted: the additive error model and the multiplicative error model. This leads to incompatible specifications of uncertainties and impedes intercomparison and application. In this letter, we assess the suitability of both models for satellite‐based daily precipitation measurements in an effort to clarify the uncertainty representation. Three criteria were employed to evaluate the applicability of either model: (1) better separation of the systematic and random errors; (2) applicability to the large range of variability in daily precipitation; and (3) better predictive skills. It is found that the multiplicative error model is a much better choice under all three criteria. It extracted the systematic errors more cleanly, was more consistent with the large variability of …",158

Uncertainty Representation and Quantification in NASA's Precipitation Data Records,"Y Tian, RF Adler, F Yan, V Maggioni, L Tang",2012/12,Journal AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,"Uncertainty representation depends on the underlying error model. The model's structure and parameters are determined from validation studies. The error model thus constructed is then used to quantify and predict the uncertainties. To implement this systematic procedure, we have developed a Bayesian probability modelling framework. This framework enables us to extract information from empirical validation studies, and to provide data users with quantitative uncertainty estimates. In addition, the parametric error model will predict uncertainty when validation data are not available, and update the uncertainty estimates when new validation data become available. This framework has been employed to represent and quantify the uncertainties in NASA's precipitation data records, in particular the high time-resolution products. The model parameters are estimated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC …",
Uncertainty Analysis in High-Time Resolution Precipitation Products,"V Maggioni, RF Adler, Y Tian, GJ Huffman, MR Sapiano, L Tang",2012/12,Journal AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,"Satellite precipitation estimates have advanced significantly in the past years. However, the estimate of associated errors for easy use in hydrological application and climate analysis has lagged. This study focuses on formulating useful estimates of systematic and random errors of the most recent version of a very highly used merged data set of surface precipitation, TMPA 3B42 Version 7. The error is evaluated at a 25km/daily scale against the Climate Prediction Center Unified Gauge precipitation in the Oklahoma region, which is characterized by a smooth terrain and a continental climate. Firstly, a comprehensive analysis of different aspects of the satellite rainfall error is performed, including the probability of no-rain detection, the distribution of missed precipitation, the false alarm rate and the hit bias. The dependence of each aspect of the error on various parameters, such as rain rate, season, gauge density …",
Using Surface Soil Moisture Data in Overland Passive Microwave Rainfall Error Modeling,"H Seyyedi, EN Anagnostou, P Kirstetter, V Maggioni, JJ Gourley, Y Hong",2012/12,Journal AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,"This study assesses the significance of using near-surface soil moisture information to model the retrieval error of NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) rainfall algorithm (2A12). The Oklahoma (OK) region is selected for the study area due to the availability of dense and long-term quality-controlled in situ hydrometeorological data from the Mesonet network and the relatively smooth terrain. The study period includes two warm seasons from March to October of 2009 and 2010. The NOAA/NSSL ground radar-based National Mosaic and QPE system (NMQ/Q2) is used as high-resolution (5-min/1-km) reference rainfall. The study utilizes soil moisture simulations from the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model forced with Q2 rainfall fields to represent TMI orbit-average surface wetness conditions (wet, dry and normal).

The Effect of Rainfall Error Characterization on the Efficiency of a Land Data Assimilation System for Soil Moisture Prediction,Viviana Maggioni,2012,Institution University of Connecticut,"This study assesses the impact of satellite-rainfall error structure on soil moisture simulations with the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) and the efficiency of assimilating near-surface soil moisture observations in the NASA Land Data Assimilation System (NASA-LDAS). A multi-dimensional satellite rainfall error model (SREM2D) is compared to the standard error model (CTRL) used to generate rainfall ensembles as part of the NASA-LDAS. The error analysis is assessed in terms of rainfall ensembles and corresponding soil moisture predictions. Comparisons of rainfall ensembles generated by SREM2D and CTRL against reference radar rainfall show that both rainfall error models preserve the rainfall error characteristics across a range of spatial scales. However, SREM2D generates rainfall replicates with higher variability that better envelope the reference rainfall than those generated by CTRL. On …",

Propagation of satellite rainfall uncertainty in runoff prediction,"EN Anagnostou, V Maggioni, HJ Vergara, JJ Gourley, Y Hong, D Stampoulis",2011/12,Journal AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,"Satellite precipitation products are crucial in flood prediction studies, especially in regions where rain and stream gauges are sparse. Quantifying the uncertainty associated with these products is critical for our understanding of error propagation into hydrologic modeling. This study assesses the impact of satellite rainfall errors on river flow simulations for different basin scales and satellite-rainfall products of varying resolution and retrieval error characteristics. The study is conducted on the Tarboro basin in the southeastern US based on a 2-year time series (2004 and 2006).

Hydrologic model calibration and validation that considers basin scale and precipitation resolution,"HJ Vergara, JJ Gourley, Y Hong, EN Anagnostou, V Maggioni",2011/12,Journal AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,"Uncertainty due to the coarse resolution of satellite rainfall products is believed to be an important source of error in satellite-based hydrologic forecasting systems. In this study, the National Weather Service (NWS) distributed hydrologic model HL-RDHM was calibrated using high-resolution (4-km, 1-hr) Multi-sensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE) rainfall and then recalibrated using the same MPE rainfall product but resampled to the satellite resolution (25-km, 3-hr) for different basin scales. A sensitivity analysis was performed on hydrologic simulations, evaluating their skill as a function of model resolution and basin scale against observed streamflow. Hydrologic skill was found to increase with basin scale up to a maximum size of approximately 2,000 km2. Conversely, the hydrologic skill was generally comparable when using forcing from MPE at its native 4-km resolution and when resampled to represent the …",

The study seeks to address the characterization of two sources of uncertainty: 1) errors in the rainfall estimation from sensor observations; and, 2) the land surface model parametric error, which manifests as non-uniqueness in soil hydraulic parameters. The study is conducted in the Oklahoma region, which presents a good coverage by weather radars, multi-year satellite rainfall products and in-situ meteorological and soil moisture measurement stations.

A MULTI-SENSOR APPROACH FOR SURFACE SOIL MOISTURE ESTIMATION,"Viviana Maggioni, Valerio Paruscio, Marco Rinaldi","Soil moisture is a key variable controlling the exchange of water and heat energy between the land and the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration. As a result, soil moisture plays an important role in development of weather patterns and extreme-event forecasting such as floods and landslides. Measurements of soil moisture provide also information for agriculture and it can be used to infer water stress for irrigation decisions, to aid in yield estimation and to assess drought conditions.Information on soil moisture may be obtained from three main sources. First, groundbased soil moisture profile measurements may be made continuously at individual points. Unfortunately, these are rarely representative of the spatial distribution, and so they are unsuitable for mapping of large areas. Second, remote sensing may be used to measure soil moisture in the top few centimeters for areas with low to moderate vegetation cover but do not provide any direct information on root zone soil moisture. Third, land surface models may be used to predict the spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture (near-surface and root zone) but those estimates suffer from inadequate model physics, parameter estimates, and atmospheric forcing data.

Soil Moisture Assimilation and Precipitation Error Modeling in the Ensemble-based GEOS-5 Land Data Assimilation System,"Rolf Reichle, Viviana Maggioni, Emmanouil Anagnostou","A key issue in soil moisture data assimilation is that observational and modeling uncertainties are poorly known, and incorrect assumptions about these errors may compromise the efficiency of the land data assimilation system (LDAS). It is thus crucial to investigate the impact of the error characterization on the assimilation of soil moisture observations, in particular because LDASs often use very simplistic error models. As rainfall is the dominant meteorological forcing input to the land surface model for soil moisture estimation, a more comprehensive characterization of rainfall uncertainty may improve soil moisture estimates. Since soil moisture temporally integrates antecedent precipitation and is subject to lower and upper limits, the variability of errors in soil moisture is typically smaller than that of errors in precipitation. This error variance relationship is not linear and depends on the error properties of the rainfall fields (Maggioni et al., 2012b). Maggioni et al.(2011) showed that the use of a complex error model to characterize the spatial variability of rainfall errors could better capture soil moisture error properties. Furthermore, in a synthetic numerical assimilation experiment, Maggioni et al.(2012a) demonstrated that using the more elaborate rainfall error model may slightly improve surface and root zone soil moisture estimates obtained from assimilating soil moisture retrievals.This study expands the synthetic experiment of Maggioni et al.(2012) by evaluating the assimilation of near-surface soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E).
