"A system for simulation, emulation, and deployment of heterogeneous sensor networks","Lewis Girod, Thanos Stathopoulos, Nithya Ramanathan, Jeremy Elson, Deborah Estrin, Eric Osterweil, Tom Schoellhammer",2004/11/3,Book Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Embedded networked sensor systems,"Recently deployed Wireless Sensor Network systems (WSNs) are increasingly following heterogeneous designs, incorporating a mixture of elements with widely varying capabilities. The development and deployment of WSNs rides heavily on the availability of simulation, emulation, visualization and analysis support. In this work, we develop tools specifically to support heterogeneous systems, as well as to support the measurement and visualization of operational systems that is critical to addressing the inevitable problems that crop up in deployment. Our system differs from related systems in three key ways: in its ability to simulate and emulate heterogeneous systems in their entirety, in its extensive support for integration and interoperability between motes and microservers, and in its unified set of tools that capture, view, and analyze real time debugging information from simulations, emulations, and deployments.",279
Lightweight temporal compression of microclimate datasets,"Tom Schoellhammer, Ben Greenstein, Eric Osterweil, Michael Wimbrow, Deborah Estrin",2004/5/5,"Description Since the inception of sensor networks, in-network processing has been touted as the enabling technology for long-lived deployments. Radio communication is the overriding consumer of energy in such networks. Therefore, data reduction before transmission, either by compression or feature extraction, will directly and significantly increase network lifetime.In many cases, it is premature to begin implementing feature extraction techniques.Users do not yet understand in what forms interesting data will appear and consequently can’t risk automatically discarding what they presume to be uninteresting. Moreover, computer scientists are only beginning to develop algorithms to collect spatially distributed features in situ.Even for the many application where all of the data must be transported out of the network, data may be compressed before transport, so long as the chosen compression technique can operate under the stringent resource constraints of low-power nodes and induces only tolerable errors. This paper evaluates a simple temporal compression scheme designed specifically to be used bymicamotes for the compaction of microclimate data. The algorithm makes use of the observation that over a small enough window of time, samples of microclimate data are linear. It finds such windows and generates a series of line segments that accurately represent the data. It compresses data up to 20-to-1 while introducing error on the order of the sensor hardware’s specified margin of error.

Measuring ipv6 adoption,"Jakub Czyz, Mark Allman, Jing Zhang, Scott Iekel-Johnson, Eric Osterweil, Michael Bailey",2014/8/17,Book Proceedings of the 2014 ACM conference on SIGCOMM,"After several IPv4 address exhaustion milestones in the last three years, it is becoming apparent that the world is running out of IPv4 addresses, and the adoption of the next generation Internet protocol, IPv6, though nascent, is accelerating. In order to better understand this unique and disruptive transition, we explore twelve metrics using ten global-scale datasets to create the longest and broadest measurement of IPv6 adoption to date. Using this perspective, we find that adoption, relative to IPv4, varies by two orders of magnitude depending on the measure examined and that care must be taken when evaluating adoption metrics in isolation. Further, we find that regional adoption is not uniform. Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly, we find that over the last three years, the nature of IPv6 utilization-in terms of traffic, content, reliance on transition technology, and performance-has shifted dramatically from prior …",188
White listing DNS top-talkers,"Eric Osterweil, Danny Mcpherson",2015/1/13,Patent office US,"Systems and methods for creating a list of trustworthy resolvers in a domain name system. A computer receives a resolver profile for a resolver sending queries to a domain name server. The resolver profile is based on any, or a combination, of a top-talker status of the resolver, a normalcy of distribution of domain names queried, a continuity of distribution of query type, and a RD bit status, and information related to query traffic based on the topology of the domain name server. Resolver profiles can be compared to a trust policy to determine whether the resolver is trustworthy. Resolvers deemed trustworthy can be added to a list of trustworthy resolvers. Embodiments can detect the occurrence of a network-based attack.

In this paper, we provide the first systematic examination of the design, deployment, and operational challenges encountered by DNSSEC over the years. Our study reveals a fundamental gap between cryptographic designs and operational Internet systems.

MitM attack by name collision: Cause analysis and vulnerability assessment in the new gTLD era,"Qi Alfred Chen, Eric Osterweil, Matthew Thomas, Z Morley Mao",2016/5/22,Conference 2016 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),"Recently, Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks on web browsing have become easier than they have ever been before because of a problem called ""Name Collision"" and a protocol called the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) protocol. This name collision attack can cause all web traffic of an Internet user to be redirected to a MitM proxy automatically right after the launching of a standard browser. The underlying problem of this attack is internal namespace WPAD query leakage, which itself is a known problem for years. However, it remains understudied since it was not easily exploitable before the recent new gTLD (generic Top-Level Domains) delegation. In this paper, we focus on this newly-exposed MitM attack vector and perform the first systematic study of the underlying problem causes and its vulnerability status in the wild.

Reducing the X. 509 Attack Surface with DNSSEC’s DANE,"Eric Osterweil, Burt Kaliski, Matt Larson, Danny McPherson",2012/3,"Journal Securing and Trusting Internet Names, SATIN","For the last decade, perhaps the most commonly used type of end-user security has been the HTTP Secure (HTTPS) protocol employed by web browsers (which runs over the Secure Sockets Layer, SSL or its successor, TLS). In HTTPS, any service (such as a website) may create its own cryptographic certificate to secure its communication channel, and clients use this certificate to verify data from, and transmit data to the server. This model has helped to secure online banking transactions, eCommerce websites, social networking websites, and more. However, two inherent complications to this approach are that clients must have a secure way to learn the authentic certificate for each website before they begin using this protocol, and they must be able to determine if they can trust the named entity that the certificate belongs to. These complications are conflated in today’s security model, which is based on a list of prespecified trusted X. 509 Certificate Authorities (CAs) that every client must know a priori, and a very ad-hoc approach to determining which of this list of CAs will vouch for any keys discovered. In this paper we first outline some of the fundamental problems that exist with today’s CA model, problems that arise from its conflation of the two inherent complications, and some of the implications and attack vectors that these problems present to the security of this model’s users. Then we introduce some of the relative benefits that can be gained from a new approach being standardized in the IETF called DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE), in which certificate credentials are verified by DNSSEC-enabled zones, rather than the …",19

Though several designs exist, there have been no significant deployments of Internet-scale security infrastructures. In this paper we propose a novel concept called the public-space that makes complete information of digital entities’ actions publicly available to every user. It is a structured framework that maintains a large number of entities, their actions, relationships, and histories. Posting such information in public does not endorse the information’s correctness, but it does provide users with a quantifiable set of information that enables them to detect faults and make informed security decisions. Combined with traditional cryptographic techniques, the public-space system can support the intrinsic heterogeneity of user security requirements in Internetscale infrastructures and applications.",19
Zone state revocation for dnssec,"Eric Osterweil, Vasileios Pappas, Dan Massey, Lixia Zhang",2007/8/27,Book Proceedings of the 2007 workshop on Large scale attack defense,"DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are designed to add cryptographic protection to the Internet's name resolution service. However the current design lacks a key revocation mechanism. In this paper we present Zone State Revocation (ZSR), a lightweight and backward compatible enhancement to DNSSEC. ZSR enables zones to explicitly revoke keys using self-certifying certificates, and enables DNS name-servers to opportunistically inform distributed caching resolvers of key revocations via lightweight control messages. Further, ZSR allows resolvers to distinguish between legitimate key changes and potential attacks when authentication chains are broken. ZSR is designed to work well with global-scale DNS operations, where millions of caches may need to be informed of a revocation, and where time is critical.",16
Limiting replay vulnerabilities in dnssec,"He Yan, Eric Osterweil, Jon Hajdu, Jonas Acres, Dan Massey",2008/10/19,Conference 2008 4th Workshop on Secure Network Protocols,"The DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) added public key cryptography to the DNS, but problems remain in selecting signature lifetimes. A zonepsilas master server distributes signatures to secondary servers. The signatures lifetimes should be long so that a secondary server can still operate if the master fails. However, DNSSEC lacks revocation. Signed data can be replayed until the signature expires and thus zones should select a short signature lifetime. Operators must choose between reduced robustness or long replay vulnerability windows. This paper introduces a revised DNSSEC signature that allows secondary servers to operate even if the master has failed while simultaneously limiting replay windows to twice the TTL. Each secondary server constructs a hash chain and relays the hash chain anchor to the master server. The signature produced by the master server ensures the authenticity of the hash …",14

This provisioning often has a monetary component: buying transit traffic capacities, setting up server infrastructure, and staffing operations, among others. It also includes capacity plans for periodic above-average bursts of traffic, slow Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes, and other suboptimal but nonthreatening client behaviors. However, DDoS attacks are designed to overcome these capacities.

The shape and size of threats: Defining a networked system's attack surface,"Eric Osterweil, Danny McPherson, Lixia Zhang",2014/10/21,Conference 2014 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Network Protocols,"As more complex security services have been added to today's Internet, it becomes increasingly difficult to quantify their vulnerability to compromise. The concept of ""attack surface"" has emerged in recent years as a measure of such vulnerabilities, however systematically quantifying the attack surfaces of networked systems remains an open challenge. In this work we propose a methodology to both quantify the attack surface and visually represent semantically different components (or resources) of such systems by identifying their dependencies. To illustrate the efficacy of our methodology, we examine two real Internet standards (the X.509 CA verification system and DANE) as case studies. We believe this work represents a first step towards systemically modeling dependencies of (and interdependencies between) networked systems, and shows the usability benefits from leveraging existing services.",12
The great ipv4 land grab: resource certification for the ipv4 grey market,"Eric Osterweil, Shane Amante, Dan Massey, Danny McPherson",2011/11/14,Book Proceedings of the 10th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks,"The era of free IPv4 address allocations has ended and the grey market in IPv4 addresses is now emerging. This paper argues that one cannot and should not try to regulate who sells addresses and at what price, but one does need to provide some proof of ownership in the form of resource certification. In this paper we identify key requirements of resource certification, gained from both theoretical analysis and operational history. We further argue these requirements can be achieved by making use of the existing reverse DNS hierarchy, enhanced with DNS Security. Our analysis compares reverse DNS entries and BGP routing tables and shows this is both feasible and achievable today; an essential requirement as the grey market is also emerging today and solutions are needed now, not years in the future.",12
Operational implications of the dns control plane,"Eric Osterweil, Danny McPherson, Lixia Zhang",2011/5/31,Journal IEEE Reliability Society Newsletter,"The Domain Name System (DNS)[7] provides vital mapping services for the Internet. It maps domain names such as ucla. edu to values ranging from IP addresses to email servers to geographic locations and more.

Managing trusted keys in internet-scale systems,"Eric Osterweil, Dan Massey, Lixia Zhang",2009/7/20,Conference 2009 Ninth Annual International Symposium on Applications and the Internet,"This paper considers a fundamental problem facing all applications that rely on public key cryptography: how to obtain, verify, and maintain the set of trusted public keys. Without some notion of where to find the right keys or which keys can be trusted, an adversary can create false keys, trick users into accepting the false keys, and impersonate legitimate online parties. Unfortunately, the problem of obtaining and managing trusted keys is made challenging by Internet's lack of a central authority: Generally speaking, there is no single point of authority to issue lists of trusted PGP keys, or SSL certificates, or DNSSEC keys for the entire Internet. In this work we explore a new direction to address the challenge of distributing and maintaining trusted keys. First, we note many of today's more successful Internet cryptographic systems (such as the SSL and PGP) use various forms of locally trusted key lists.",11
The missing piece: On namespace management in NDN and how DNSSEC might help,"Pouyan Fotouhi Tehrani, Eric Osterweil, Jochen H Schiller, Thomas C Schmidt, Matthias Wählisch",2019/9/24,Book Proceedings of the 6th ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking,"Names are the cornerstone of every Information-Centric Network (ICN), nonetheless, namespace management has been by far neglected in ICN.

20 years of DDoS: A call to action,"Eric Osterweil, Angelos Stavrou, Lixia Zhang",2019/4/4,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.02739,"Botnet Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are now 20 years old; what has changed in that time? Their disruptive presence, their volume, distribution across the globe, and the relative ease of launching them have all been trending in favor of attackers. Our increases in network capacity and our architectural design principles are making our online world richer, but are favoring attackers at least as much as Internet services. The DDoS mitigation techniques have been evolving but they are losing ground to the increasing sophistication and diversification of the attacks that have moved from the network to the application level, and we are operationally falling behind attackers. It is time to ask fundamental questions: are there core design issues in our network architecture that fundamentally enable DDoS attacks? How can our network infrastructure be enhanced to address the principles that enable the DDoS problem? How can we incentivize the development and deployment of the necessary changes? In this article, we want to sound an alarm and issue a call to action to the research community. We propose that basic research and principled analyses are badly needed, because the status quo does not paint a pretty picture for the future.",9

Report TR-13-004","On February 3, 2011 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocated the last unallocated blocks of IPv4 address space to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). While many solutions that tackle the problem of address scarcity have been proposed (eg address markets), the predominant opinion is that networks will eventually adopt the new Internet Protocol, IPv6. As a result, the Internet is on the verge of its first fundamentally disruptive transition–one which will impose extensive change throughout the network. This inflection point offers a unique opportunity to measure the adoption of new technologies at an unprecedented scale. In this paper, we tackle the problem of measuring this significant transition by first providing a framework to assess the complex ecosystem that underlies IPv6 adoption. We then provide the largest and most comprehensive snapshot of this evolution to date.",9

Expect more from the networking: Ddos mitigation by fitt in named data networking,"Zhiyi Zhang, Vishrant Vasavada, Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla, Angelos Stavrou, Eric Osterweil, Lixia Zhang",2019/2/24,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09033,"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have plagued the Internet for decades, but the basic defense approaches have not fundamentally changed. Rather, the size and rate of growth in attacks have actually outpaced carriers' and DDoS mitigation services' growth, calling for new solutions that can be, partially or fully, deployed imminently and exhibit effectiveness. In this paper, we examine the basic functions in Named Data Networking (NDN), a newly proposed Internet architecture, that can address the principle weaknesses in today's IP networks. We demonstrate by a new DDoS mitigation solution over NDN, Fine-grained Interest Traffic Throttling FITT, that NDN's architectural changes, even when incrementally deployed, can make DDoS attacks fundamentally more difficult to launch and less effective. FITT leverages the NDN design to enable the network to detect DDoS from victim's feedback, throttles DDoS traffic by reverse its exact paths through the network, and enforces control over the misbehaving entities at their sources. Our extensive simulation results show that FITT can throttle attack traffic with one-way time delay from the victim to the NDN gateway; upon activation, FITT effectively stop attack traffic from impacting benign flows, resulting in over 99\% of packets reaching victims being legitimate ones. We further demonstrate that service providers may implement NDN/FITT on existing CDN nodes as an incrementally deployable solution to effectuate the application level remediation at the sources, which remains unattainable in today's DDoS mitigation approaches.",7

TASRS: Towards a Secure Routing System Through Internet Number Resource Certification,"Eric Osterweil, Shane Amante, Danny McPherson",2013/2/3,"Publisher Verisign Labs Technical Report, 1130009","The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the Internet’s core routing protocol. Today, any BGP speaker can attest to be the origin for any IP prefix, and this results in the implicit assertion that this ASN is the rightful resource holder for that IP prefix. Unfortunately, any BGP speaker can lie about this. Such lies have allowed BGP speakers to “leak routes” and “hijack” each others prefixes. There has never been a programmatic way to securely disambiguate who the rightful resource holder actually is for any given IP prefix, or any Autonomous System Number (ASN). This leaves a very pronounced need for an Internet number resource certification framework. BGP, for example, currently propagates unverified announcements from origin ASNs to their neighbors, who selectively re-announce them to their neighbors in a form of gossip. Meanwhile, none of these parties have any way to properly assure the veracity of the announcements they are working from.",4

To assure DNS’s efficient and robust operations, each domain, especially each of the Top-Level-Domains (TLDs), should deploy multiple redundant nameservers in diverse locations. To assess the robustness of TLD nameserver deployment regarding the nameserver redundancy and location diversity, we conduct a measurement study by sending special DNS queries and running traceroute to TLD nameservers from about 200 PlanetLab sites. By combining the measurement data with other data sources including IP address assignment, BGP routing tables, and IP address location inference, we identify the nameserver providers for all TLDs and the locations of their servers. Our results suggest that TLD nameservers are adequately distributed as of today, more than 90% TLDs can survive from single point failure. We also observe that many TLD nameservers are co-located at a small group of “hot spots”. We conduct simulations to evaluate the impact of such co-locations. Our results show that failure of single hot spot does not affect robustness of TLD services.",2

A Cooperative Market-based Decision Guidance Approach for Resilient Power Systems.,"Alexander Brodsky, Eric Osterweil, Roberto Levy",2021,Conference ICORES,"National and local economies are strongly dependent on stable power systems. While the problem of power system resilience in the face of natural disasters and terrorist attacks has been extensively studied from the systems engineering perspective, a major unsolved problem remains in the need for preventive solutions against the collapse of power systems. These solutions must ensure the most economically efficient operation of power systems, within the bounds of any remaining power capacity. Transferring power usage rights from the lowest-loss to the highest-loss entities would result in significant reduction of the combined loss. The existing power systems do not take this fact into account. To address this need, we envision a paradigm shift toward three-step system for (1) a cooperation power market where power usage rights can be transferred among participating entities,(2) decision guidance to recommend market asks and bids to each entity, and (3) optimization that, given the market clearance, will recommend precise operational controls for each entity’s microgrid. The key challenge to address is the design of this three-step market system that will guarantee important properties including Pareto-optimality, individual rationality, and fairness, as well as privacy, security, pseudo-anonymity and non-repudiation.",1

This paper provides a formal model of a consistency checking key learning and verification approach based on the concept of Public Data. Public Data offers a probabilistic description of users’ risks based on the structure of their own deployments. A user of this framework can provision her own Community of Trust in such a way that she can reduce and accurately estimate the probability of being spoofed by an adversary.

IPsec’s Appeal: Protecting DNS Under the Covers,"Eric Osterweil, Danny McPherson",1130006,Publisher Verisign Labs Technical Report,"IPsec is a network-layer protection suite that has met with limited deployment success. While there are clearly some applications for which it is well suited (such as Virtual Private Networks, VPNs), there is often debate over the idea of a wider role for it. Indeed, when applications and higher level protocols are secured by semantics above the network layer, such as by SSL/TLS, DNSSEC, etc. the network layer’s protections are often left unaddressed. We propose that security assurances should be embraced by as many layers as possible, and that securing semantics above the network layer should not obviate one from securing the network layer itself. Specifically, we propose that there are very tangible benefits to be gained by augmenting DNSSEC’s protections with IPsec. In this work we will outline the specific ways in which IPsec can be used to augment DNSSEC and how their protections are complimentary.",1
lbsh: Pounding Science into the Command-Line,"Eric Osterweil, Lixia Zhang","The definition of science is rooted in the notion that results must be reproducible.

In order to facilitate this in Computer Science, a detailed step-by-step record of how each result-set was generated is critical. This is called Data Provenance and when done well it enables researchers to understand the precise nature of each other’s work.

Having your cake and eating it too: Domain Name Data Networking (DNDN),"Eric Osterweil, Craig Murray, Aziz Mohaisen","Named Data Networking (NDN) is a new architecture that has been proposed for the Internet. Among its insights is the realization that we predominantly use the Internet to access data, and that the endpoints of communications are generally not our focus. Indeed, the Internet Protocol and the use of IP addresses is just a means for delivery of content that could be directly addressed and distributed in a more efficient manner. However, the NDN architecture has several design and deployment obstacles. First, it relies heavily on caching among a dense population of NDN nodes, and yet there will be very few nodes deployed initially. Second, it uses an unstructured namespace in which names can be chosen by content providers. This makes it challenging to disambiguate which provider is the actual authority for a name. Third, NDN ensures security through cryptographic signatures on all data packets, but NDN does not have an architecture for securely discovering and verifying the authenticity of keys. These are just some of the barriers to widespread adoption of NDN. We suggest that all of these problems (and more) can be solved by implementing NDN on top of the Domain Name System (DNS). We propose Domain Name Data Networking (DNDN) as a possible way to facilitate use of NDN within the existing infrastructure. In this model, DNS becomes a substrate from which NDN can leverage essential components. We show the feasibility of DNDN, we evaluate the benefits if it were deployed, and we show a simulated sample application that uses it.

Cross-Modal Vulnerabilities: An Illusive form of Hijacking,"Eric Osterweil, Dan Massey, Christos Papadopoulos","Content, connection, and other types of hijacking are a common occurrence in today’s Internet. One can broadly classify various types of hijacks as being locally scoped to an administrative domain, or pushed externally; where one administrative domain (intentionally or unintentionally) hijacks users in other domains. Current work in identifying and reacting to various types of Internet hijacking has focused on the network control plane and has not included cross-modal hijacks that involve both the control plane and the data plane of the Internet. In this work we introduce the idea that crossmodal threats exist in the Internet and form a highly illusive, but serious threat. Further, we detail an actual instance of Internet-scale cross-modal hijacking whose behavior depends on both network control data and data plane such as the order in which users request connections. Based on anecdotal evidence gleaned from several websites, it appears that this hijack existed for many months (and possibly years) before its recent detection.","Scholar articles Cross-Modal Vulnerabilities: An Illusive form of HijackingE Osterweil, D Massey, C PapadopoulosRelated articles All 2 versions ","Content, connection, and other types of hijacking are a common occurrence in today’s Internet.

The Shape and Size of Threats: Defining Attack Surface,"Eric Osterweil, Danny McPherson, Lixia Zhang","Security and privacy have become very relevant concerns in our online lives. However as we have created complex and layered security services, it has become increasingly difficult to quantify their vulnerability to compromise. Security solutions must strive for both usability of the security system and understandability of their vulnerabilities. The concept of “attack surface” has emerged in recent years as a measure of such vulnerabilities, however systematically quantifying the attack surfaces of networked systems with high degrees of interdependencies remains an open challenge (especially in an expressive way). In this work we propose a methodology to both quantify the attack surface and visually represent semantically different components (or resources) of such systems by identifying their systemic dependencies.

Verifying Keys through Publicity and Communities of Trust: Quantifying Off-Axis Corroboration [Supplemental Material],"Eric Osterweil, Dan Massey, Danny McPherson, Lixia Zhang, I Operational DNSSEC","The DNS Security Extensions’[5],[7],[6](DNSSEC’s) design goal is to prove that data in a DNS reply is authentic. In order to do this, each zone creates public/private key pairs and then uses the private portions to sign data. Its public keys are stored in DNS records called DNSKEYs, and all the signatures are stored in records called RRSIGs. In response to a query from a DNS resolver, an authoritative server returns both the requested data and its associated RRSIGs. A resolver that has learned and authenticated the DNSKEY of the requested zone can verify the origin authenticity and integrity of the reply data. To resist replay attacks, each signature carries a definitive expiration time. In order to authenticate the DNSKEY for a given zone, say bar. edu, the resolver needs to construct a chain of trust that follows the DNS hierarchy from a trusted zone key (such as the root’s) down to the key of the zone in question (this is shown in Figure 1). In the ideal case, the public key of the DNS root zone would be obtained offline in a secure way and stored at the resolver, so that the resolver can use it to authenticate the public key of. edu. Then, the public key of. edu would be used to authenticate the public key of bar. edu. There are two challenges in building the chain of trust. First, a parent zone must encode the authentication of each of its child zone’s public keys in the DNS. To accomplish this, the parent zone creates and signs a Delegation Signer (DS) record that is a hash (SHA1, SHA256, etc.) of a DNSKEY record at the child zone, and signs it with its own key. This creates an authentication link from the parent to child.

Quantifying Systemic Dependencies Through Attack Surface Analysis,"Eric Osterweil, Danny McPherson, Lixia Zhang","To systematically address the increasing security threats of today’s networked systems, one important step is to quantify the potential vulnerabilities a system may face. The concept of “attack surface” has emerged in recent years as a measure of such vulnerabilities. However given the high degrees of interdependencies among networked systems, it remains an open challenge of how to systematically identify and quantify the attack surface of a given system. In this work we use two real Internet systems, the X. 509 CA verification system and DANE, a newly standardized alternative solution, as case studies to showcase a novel methodology that offers a repeatable way to systematically quantify their attack surface. We believe this work represents the first step towards systemically modeling dependencies of actual Internet-scale systems in order to formally quantify the often elusive notion of a system’s attack surface.","Scholar articles Quantifying Systemic Dependencies Through Attack Surface AnalysisE Osterweil, D McPherson, L ZhangRelated articles ","To systematically address the increasing security threats of today’s networked systems, one important step is to quantify the potential vulnerabilities a system may face.

Quantifying the Operational Status of the DNSSEC Deployment UCLA Technical Report# 080019,"Eric Osterweil, Michael Ryan, Dan Massey, Lixia Zhang","This paper examines the deployment of the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), which adds cryptographic protection to DNS, one of the core components in the Internet infrastructure. We analyze the data collected from the initial DNSSEC deployment which started over 2 years ago, and identify three critical metrics to gauge the deployment: availability, verifiability, and validity. Our results provide the first comprehensive look at DNSSEC’s deployment and reveal a number of challenges that were not anticipated in the design but have become evident in the deployment. First, obstacles such as middle-boxes (firewalls, NATs, etc.) that exist in today’s Internet infrastructure have proven to be problematic and have resulted in unforeseen availability problems. Second, the public-key delegation system of DNSSEC has not evolved as it was hoped and it currently leaves over 97% of DNSSEC zones isolated and unverifiable, unless some external key authentication mechanism is added. Furthermore, our results show that cryptographic verification is not equivalent to validation; a piece of verified data can still contain the wrong value. Finally, our results demonstrate the essential role of monitoring and measurement in the DNSSEC deployment.

A Survey of Debugging Techniques Applicable to Wireless Sensor Networks,"Eric Osterweil, Nithya Ramanathan, A Existing Solutions","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are networks of small, embedded processors connected to sensors that communicate over low-power radios.
