Age-aggregation bias in mortality trends,"Andrew Gelman, Jonathan Auerbach",2016/2/16,Journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"In PNAS, Case and Deaton (1) show a figure illustrating the “marked increase in the all-cause mortality of middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women in the United States between 1999 and 2013.” The authors state that their numbers “are not age-adjusted within the 10-y 45–54 age group”(1). We suspected an aggregation bias and examined whether the increase in aggregate mortality rates could be due to the changing composition of this age group. Adjusting for age confirmed this suspicion. Contrary to Case and Deaton’s figure (1), we find there is not a steady increase in mortality rates for this age group. Instead there is an increasing trend from 1999 to 2005 and a constant trend thereafter. Moreover, stratifying age-adjusted mortality rates by sex shows a marked increase only for women and not men, contrary to the article’s headline. Age-adjustment is not merely an academic exercise.

A simple explanation for declining temperature sensitivity with warming,"EM Wolkovich, J Auerbach, CJ Chamberlain, DM Buonaiuto, AK Ettinger, I Morales‐Castilla, A Gelman",2021/10,Journal Global Change Biology,"Recently, multiple studies have reported declining phenological sensitivities (∆ days per ℃) with higher temperatures. Such observations have been used to suggest climate change is reshaping biological processes, with major implications for forecasts of future change. Here, we show that these results may simply be the outcome of using linear models to estimate nonlinear temperature responses, specifically for events that occur after a cumulative thermal threshold is met—a common model for many biological events. Corrections for the nonlinearity of temperature responses consistently remove the apparent decline. Our results show that rising temperatures combined with linear estimates based on calendar time produce the observations of declining sensitivity—without any shift in the underlying biology. Current methods may thus undermine efforts to identify when and how warming will reshape biological …",17
Expressions of loss predict aggressive comments on Twitter among gang-involved youth in Chicago,"Desmond Upton Patton, Owen Rambow, Jonathan Auerbach, Kevin Li, William Frey",2018/3/28,Journal NPJ digital medicine,"Recent studies suggest social media shapes the transmission of firearm violence in high-poverty, urban neighborhoods. However, the exact pathways by which content on social media becomes threatening has not been studied. We consider a dataset of tweets by gang-involved Chicago youth that are coded for expressions of aggression and/or loss. Using a permutation test and mixed-effects log linear regression, we find that aggression and loss tweets do not occur randomly, and furthermore that in a 2-day window after loss expressions we find an increase in aggressive tweets. We discuss implications for intervention.",16
Machine learning and data mining in complex genomic data—a review on the lessons learned in Genetic Analysis Workshop 19,"Inke R König, Jonathan Auerbach, Damian Gola, Elizabeth Held, Emily R Holzinger, Marc-André Legault, Rui Sun, Nathan Tintle, Hsin-Chou Yang",2016/12,Source BMC genetics,"In the analysis of current genomic data, application of machine learning and data mining techniques has become more attractive given the rising complexity of the projects. As part of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19, approaches from this domain were explored, mostly motivated from two starting points. First, assuming an underlying structure in the genomic data, data mining might identify this and thus improve downstream association analyses. Second, computational methods for machine learning need to be developed further to efficiently deal with the current wealth of data. In the course of discussing results and experiences from the machine learning and data mining approaches, six common messages were extracted. These depict the current state of these approaches in the application to complex genomic data. Although some challenges remain for future studies, important forward steps were taken in the integration of different data types and the evaluation of the evidence. Mining the data for underlying genetic or phenotypic structure and using this information in subsequent analyses proved to be extremely helpful and is likely to become of even greater use with more complex data sets.",13

Forecasting the urban skyline with extreme value theory,"Jonathan Auerbach, Phyllis Wan",2020/7/1,Journal International Journal of Forecasting,"The world’s urban population is expected to grow fifty percent by the year 2050 and exceed six billion. The major challenges confronting cities, such as sustainability, safety, and equality, will depend on the infrastructure developed to accommodate the increase. Urban planners have long debated the consequences of vertical expansion—the concentration of residents by constructing tall buildings—over horizontal expansion—the dispersal of residents by extending urban boundaries. Yet relatively little work has predicted the vertical expansion of cities and quantified the likelihood and therefore urgency of these consequences.",10
Causal modeling in a multi-omic setting: insights from GAW20,"Jonathan Auerbach, Richard Howey, Lai Jiang, Anne Justice, Liming Li, Karim Oualkacha, Sergi Sayols-Baixeras, Stella W Aslibekyan",2018/9,Journal BMC genetics,"Increasingly available multilayered omics data on large populations has opened exciting analytic opportunities and posed unique challenges to robust estimation of causal effects in the setting of complex disease phenotypes. The GAW20 Causal Modeling Working Group has applied complementary approaches (eg, Mendelian randomization, structural equations modeling, Bayesian networks) to discover novel causal effects of genomic and epigenomic variation on lipid phenotypes, as well as to validate prior findings from observational studies. Two Mendelian randomization studies have applied novel approaches to instrumental variable selection in methylation data, identifying bidirectional causal effects of CPT1A and triglycerides, as well as of RNMT and C6orf42, on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to fenofibrate. The CPT1A finding also emerged in a Bayesian network study. The Mendelian randomization studies have implemented both existing and novel steps to account for pleiotropic effects, which were independently detected in the GAW20 data via a structural equation modeling approach. Two studies estimated indirect effects of genomic variation (via DNA methylation and/or correlated phenotypes) on lipid outcomes of interest. Finally, a novel weighted R2 measure was proposed to complement other causal inference efforts by controlling for the influence of outlying observations. The GAW20 contributions illustrate the diversity of possible approaches to causal inference in the multi-omic context, highlighting the promises and assumptions of each method and the benefits of integrating both across methods and across omics …",8
Does voting by mail increase fraud? Estimating the change in reported voter fraud when states switch to elections by mail,"Jonathan Auerbach, Steve Pierson",2021/1/1,Journal Statistics and Public Policy,"We estimate the change in the reported number of voter fraud cases when states switch to conducting elections by mail. We consider two types of states in which voting is facilitated by mail: states where a large number of voters receive ballots by mail (receive-by-mail states, RBM) and a subset of these states where registered voters are automatically sent ballots by mail (vote-by-mail states, VBM). We then compare the number of voter fraud cases in RBM (VBM) states to the number of cases in non-RBM (non-VBM) states, using two approaches standard in the social sciences. We find no evidence that voting by mail increases the risk of voter fraud overall. Between 2016 and 2019, RBM (VBM) states reported similar fraud rates to non-RBM (non-VBM) states. Moreover, we estimate Washington would have reported 73 more cases of fraud between 2011 and 2019 had it not introduced its VBM law. While our analysis of …",5
The Quality of the 2020 Census: An Independent Assessment of Census Bureau Activities Critical to Data Quality,"Paul Biemer, Joseph Salvo, Jonathan Auerbach",2021/10/5,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.02135,"This report summarizes major findings from an independent evaluation of 2020 census operations. The American Statistical Association 2020 Census Quality Indicators Task Force selected the authors to conduct the evaluation using nonpublic operations data provided by the Census Bureau. The evaluation focused on the quality of state-level population counts released by the Census Bureau for congressional apportionment. The authors first partitioned the census enumeration process into five operation phases. Within each phase, one or more activities considered to be critical to census data quality were identified. Operational data from each activity were then analyzed to assess the risk of error, particularly as they related to similar activities in the 2010 census. Overall, the evaluation found that census operations relied on higher risk activities at a higher rate in 2020 than in 2010, suggesting that the risk of error may be higher in 2020 than in 2010. However, the available data were insufficient to determine whether the apportionment counts are of lower quality in 2020 than in 2010.",3
A hierarchical Bayes approach to adjust for selection bias in before–after analyses of vision zero policies,"Jonathan Auerbach, Christopher Eshleman, Rob Trangucci",2021/2/24,Journal Computational Statistics,"American cities devote significant resources to the implementation of traffic safety countermeasures that prevent pedestrian fatalities. However, the before–after comparisons typically used to evaluate the success of these countermeasures often suffer from selection bias. This paper motivates the tendency for selection bias to overestimate the benefits of traffic safety policy, using New York City’s Vision Zero strategy as an example. The NASS General Estimates System, Fatality Analysis Reporting System and other databases are combined into a Bayesian hierarchical model to calculate a more realistic before–after comparison. The results confirm the before–after analysis of New York City’s Vision Zero policy did in fact overestimate the effect of the policy, and a more realistic estimate is roughly two-thirds the size.

Identifying regions of disease-related variants in admixed populations with the summation partition approach,"Jonathan Auerbach, Michael Agne, Rachel Fan, Adeline Lo, Shaw-Hwa Lo, Tian Zheng, Pei Wang",2016/10,Conference BMC proceedings,We propose a new method for identifying disease-related regions of single nucleotide variants in recently admixed populations. We use principal component analysis to derive both global and local ancestry information. We then use the summation partition approach to search for disease-related regions based on both rare variants and the local ancestral information of each region. We demonstrate this method using individuals with high systolic blood pressure from a sample of unrelated Mexican American subjects provided in the 19th Genetic Analysis Workshop.,1
Network-guided interaction mining for the blood pressure phenotype of unrelated individuals in genetic analysis workshop 19,"Adeline Lo, Michael Agne, Jonathan Auerbach, Rachel Fan, Shaw-Hwa Lo, Pei Wang, Tian Zheng",2016/10,Conference BMC proceedings,"Interactions between genes are an important part of the genetic architecture of complex diseases. In this paper, we use literature-guided individual genes known to be associated with type 2 diabetes (referred to as “seed genes”) to create a larger list of genes that share implied or direct networks with these seed genes. This larger list of genes are known to interact with each other, but whether they interact in ways to influence hypertension in individuals presents an interesting question. Using Genetic Analysis Workshop data on individuals with diabetes, for which only case-control labels of hypertension are known, we offer a foray into identification of diabetes-related gene interactions that are associated with hypertension. We use the approach of Lo et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 105: 12387-12392, 2008), which creates a score to identify pairwise significant gene associations. We find that the genes GCK and PAX4, formerly known to be found within similar coexpression and pathway networks but without specific direct interactions, do, in fact, show significant joint interaction effects for hypertension.",1

Reevaluating COVID-19 Mandates using Tensor Completion,"Jonathan Auerbach, Martin Slawski, Shixue Zhang",2022/3/9,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.04689,"We propose a new method that uses tensor completion to estimate causal effects with multivariate longitudinal data -- data in which multiple outcomes are observed for each unit and time period. Our motivation is to estimate the number of COVID-19 fatalities prevented by government mandates such as travel restrictions, mask-wearing directives, and vaccination requirements. In addition to COVID-19 fatalities, we also observe the number of fatalities from other diseases and injuries. The proposed method arranges the data as a tensor with three dimensions -- unit, time, and outcome -- and uses tensor completion to impute the missing counterfactual outcomes. We use the method to investigate an empirical paradox in which observational studies estimate the benefit of mask-wearing directives to be five times higher than a randomized controlled trial (cf. Talic et al., BMJ, 2021; Abaluck et al., Science, 2021); when applied to observational data, our estimate is more consistent with the randomized controlled trial, suggesting mandates prevent fewer fatalities than reported by the typical observational study. We then provide several justifications. Most notably, we show that under standard regularity conditions, combining multiple outcomes improves the accuracy of counterfactual imputations. Our method can be applied whenever multivariate longitudinal data are available, but we believe it is particularly timely as governments increasingly rely on this data to choose between mandates. Governments should use all available data to choose the mandates that best balance public health and individual liberties as new waves of COVID-19 variants are …",

We extrapolate the percent of households enumerated by the Census Bureau from reports dated between August 19th, 2020 and September 12th, 2020 to determine the percent that will be enumerated each day if field operations continue to count households at their currently decreasing rate. We then use omission, erroneous enumeration, and imputation rates from 2010 Census operations to construct three scenarios of 2020 Census quality. For each scenario, we estimate the changes in apportionment and Medicaid funding that would occur under each deadline. Our estimates suggest that under a September 30th deadline, California, Ohio, or Idaho could gain seats in the House of Representatives, while Florida or Montana could lose seats (that they might not have under an October 31st deadline). They also suggest Texas, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina could collectively forfeit as much as five hundred million dollars in federal Medicaid funding each year under a September 30th deadline (that they would receive under an October 31st deadline).(Medicaid funding represents only a small portion of the estimated $1.5 trillion distributed using census data.)

Twelve Cities: Does lowering speed limits save pedestrian lives?,"Jonathan Auerbach, Rob Trangucci","Over the last few years, American cities have started to establish aggressive countermeasures that force road users to make safer decisions. These policies are collectively known as Vision Zero and have a stated goal of creating a road system with zero traffic fatalities.In theory, Vision Zero is a comprehensive road investment strategy that prioritizes safety over vehicle mobility by anticipating human error and then slowing vehicles to the safest possible travel speed. Citywide road redesign and increased levels of enforcement and outreach are integral to a Vision Zero strategy (Tingvall and Haworth 2000). These approaches are effective because they confine drivers, considerably reducing the chance that human error will result in a fatality. Yet such changes are costly to implement and challenging to sustain across an entire city. In practice, policymakers simply mandate that vehicles reduce their travel speed by lowering the posted speed limit below the speed for which the road was originally designed.","Scholar articles Twelve Cities: Does lowering speed limits save pedestrian lives?J Auerbach, R TrangucciRelated articles ","Over the last few years, American cities have started to establish aggressive countermeasures that force road users to make safer decisions.
