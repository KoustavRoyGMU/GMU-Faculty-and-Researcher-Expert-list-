It is therefore common practice to emulate the asymmetry of traditional public key based cryptographic services through a set of protocols [1] using symmetric key based message authentication codes (MACs). Although the low computational complexity of MACs is advantageous, the protocol layer requires time synchronization between devices on the network and a significant amount of overhead for communication and temporary storage. The requirement for a general purpose CPU to implement these protocols as well as their complexity makes them prone to vulnerabilities and practically eliminates all the advantages of using symmetric key techniques in the first place.

In this paper we show that special purpose ultra-low power hardware implementations of public key algorithms can be used on sensor nodes. The reduced protocol overhead due to public key cryptography (PKC) translates into less packet transmissions and hence, power savings.

Lightweight cryptography for FPGAs,"Panasayya Yalla, Jens-Peter Kaps",2009/12/9,Conference 2009 international conference on reconfigurable computing and FPGAs,"The advent of new low-power field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) for battery powered devices opens a host of new applications to FPGAs. In order to provide security on resource constrained devices lightweight cryptographic algorithms have been developed. However, there has not been much research on porting these algorithms to FPGAs.

Our implementations are the first reported of these block ciphers on FPGAs.

Similarly, an ASIC-based key search machine is in general only applicable to one specific encryption algorithm.

A configurable ring-oscillator-based PUF for Xilinx FPGAs,"Xin Xin, Jens-Peter Kaps, Kris Gaj",2011/8/31,Conference 2011 14th Euromicro conference on digital system design,"Devadas has first proposed the notion of Silicon Physical Unclonable Function (sPUF), which takes advantage of delay variations of wires and gates. A Ring-Oscillator-Based PUF (RO PUF) is one possible implementation of an sPUF. One disadvantage of RO PUFs is that they require one pair of ring oscillators per bit of output. Therefore, in order to collect enough output bits for a safe security level, a large number of ring oscillators is needed. Configurable PUFs may help solving this problem. In 2009, Maiti introduced a configurable RO PUF to improve RO PUF reliability, where each RO is implemented in one configurable logic block (CLB) by using lookup tables (LUTs) and dedicated multiplexers.

Universal hash functions for emerging ultra-low-power networks,"Kaan Yuksel, Jens-Peter Kaps, Berk Sunar",2004/1,Journal Proceedings of the communications networks and distributed systems modeling and simulation conference,"Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are a valu-able tool for ensuring the integrity of messages. MACs may be built around a keyed hash function. In this paper, we propose three variations on NH (a universal hash function explored in UMAC [1]), namely PH, PR and WH. Our main motivation was to prove that universal hash functions can be employed to provide provable security in ultra-low-power applications such as the next generation self-powered sensor networks. The first hash function we propose, ie PH, produces a hash of length 2w and is shown to be 2− w-almost universal. The other two hash functions, ie PR and WH, reach optimality and are proven to be universal hash functions with a much shorter hash length of w. In addition, these schemes are simple enough to allow for efficient constructions. To the best of our knowledge the proposed hash functions are the first ones specifically designed for low-power hardware implementations. We achieved drastic power savings of up to 59% and speedup of up to 7.4 times over NH. Note that the speed improvement and the power reduction are accomplished simultaneously. Our implementation of WH consumes only 11. 6 µW at 500 kHz. It could therefore be integrated into a self-powered device. This enables the use of hash functions in ultra-low-power applications such as “Smart Dust” motes and RFIDs. By virtue of their security and implementation features mentioned above, we believe that the proposed universal hash functions will fill an important gap in cryptographic hardware applications.",72

We achieved substantial power savings of up to 59 percent and a speedup of up to 7.4 times over NH. Moreover, we show how the technique of multihashing and the Toeplitz approach can be combined to reduce the power and energy consumption even further while maintaining the same security level with a very slight increase in the amount of the key material.

Investigation of DPA resistance of block RAMs in cryptographic implementations on FPGAs,"Shaunak Shah, Rajesh Velegalati, Jens-Peter Kaps, David Hwang",2010/12/13,Conference 2010 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs,"Security at low cost is an important factor for cryptographic hardware implementations. Unfortunately, the security of cryptographic implementations is threatened by Side Channel Analysis (SCA). SCA attempts to discover the secret key of a device by exploiting implementation characteristics and bypassing the algorithm's mathematical security. Differential Power Analysis (DPA) is a type of SCA, which exploits the device's power consumption characteristics. Several countermeasures to DPA have been proposed, however, all of them increase security at the cost of increased area which in-turn leads to increased power consumption and reduced throughput. FPGAs are popular due to their reconfigurability, lower development cost, off-the-shelf availability and shorter time to market.

We propose principle rules for Partial DDL to guide the designer in how to split up a circuit into DDL protected and unprotected paths. In order to validate our approach we implemented a lightweight architecture of AES in the Partial Separated Dynamic Differential Logic (Partial SDDL) for FPGAs.

The received submissions were first verified for correct functionality and compliance with the hardware API’s specification. Then, the execution times in clock cycles, as a function of input sizes, have been determined using behavioral simulation. An overhead of modifying vs. reusing a key between two consecutive inputs was quantified. The compatibility of all implementations with FPGA toolsets from three major vendors, Xilinx, Intel, and Lattice Semiconductor was verified. Optimized values of the maximum clock frequency and resource utilization metrics, such as the number of look-up tables (LUTs) and flip-flops (FFs), were obtained by running optimization tools, such as Minerva, ATHENa, and Xeda.

Comparison of cost of protection against differential power analysis of selected authenticated ciphers,"William Diehl, Abubakr Abdulgadir, Farnoud Farahmand, Jens-Peter Kaps, Kris Gaj",2018/9/19,Journal Cryptography,"Authenticated ciphers, which combine the cryptographic services of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication into one algorithmic construct, can potentially provide improved security and efficiencies in the processing of sensitive data. However, they are vulnerable to side-channel attacks such as differential power analysis (DPA). Although the Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) methodology has been used to confirm improved resistance of block ciphers to DPA after application of countermeasures, extension of TVLA to authenticated ciphers is non-trivial, since authenticated ciphers have expanded input and output requirements, complex interfaces, and long test vectors which include protocol necessary to describe authenticated cipher operations. In this research, we upgrade the FOBOS test architecture with capability to perform TVLA on authenticated ciphers. We show that FPGA implementations of the CAESAR Round 3 candidates ACORN, Ascon, CLOC (with AES and TWINE primitives), SILC (with AES, PRESENT, and LED primitives), JAMBU (with AES and SIMON primitives), and Ketje Jr.; as well as AES-GCM, are vulnerable to 1st order DPA. We then use threshold implementations to protect the above cipher implementations against 1st order DPA, and verify the effectiveness of countermeasures using the TVLA methodology. Finally, we compare the unprotected and protected cipher implementations in terms of area, performance (maximum frequency and throughput), throughput-to-area (TP/A) ratio, power, and energy per bit (E/bit).

High speed FPGA architectures for the data encryption standard.,Jens-Peter Kaps,1998/5,Institution Worcester Polytechnic Institute.,"Most modern security standards and security applications are de ned to be algorithm independent, that is, they allow a choice from a set of cryptographic algorithms for the same function. Since the Data Encryption Standard (DES) is currently the most widely used private-key encryption algorithm, DES is usually amongst them. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) are recon gurable hardware devices. They can switch algorithms on-they. Thus, cryptographic algorithms which are implemented on FPGAs provide an an ideal match for algorithm independent security applications. On FPGAs, cryptographic algorithms can run much faster than on software while preserving the security of traditional hardware solutions. At the same time, FPGAs allow potentially the same exibility as software does. Although there have been a few previous reports on DES implementations on recon gurable devices, there has been no systematic treatment of that matter. We designed and implemented various architecture options with strong emphasis on high-speed performance. Techniques like pipelining and loop unrolling were used and their e ectiveness for DES on FPGAs investigated. We also performed optimization on a lower level. The most interesting result is that we could achieve data rates of up to 384 Mbit/s using a standard Xilinx FPGA (speed-grade-3). This result is by factor 30 faster than software implementations while we are still maintaining exibility. ii",26

DPA resistance for light-weight implementations of cryptographic algorithms on FPGAs,"Rajesh Velegalati, Jens-Peter Kaps",2009/8/31,Conference 2009 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications,"Recent advances in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology are bound to make FPGAs a popular platform for battery powered devices.

However, Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks pose a sever threat against otherwise secure cryptographic implementations. Current techniques to defend against DPA attacks such as Dynamic Differential Logic (DDL) lead to an increase in area consumption of factor five or more. In this paper we show that moderate security against DPA attacks can be achieved for FPGAs using DDL resulting in an area increase of not much more than a factor two over standard FPGA implementations. Our design flow requires only FPGA design tools and some scripts.",21

Comparing the cost of protecting selected lightweight block ciphers against differential power analysis in low-cost FPGAs,"William Diehl, Abubakr Abdulgadir, Jens-Peter Kaps, Kris Gaj",2018/4/23,Journal Computers,"Lightweight block ciphers are an important topic in the Internet of Things (IoT) since they provide moderate security while requiring fewer resources than the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Ongoing cryptographic contests and standardization efforts evaluate lightweight block ciphers on their resistance to power analysis side channel attack (SCA), and the ability to apply countermeasures. While some ciphers have been individually evaluated, a large-scale comparison of resistance to side channel attack and the formulation of absolute and relative costs of implementing countermeasures is difficult, since researchers typically use varied architectures, optimization strategies, technologies, and evaluation techniques. In this research, we leverage the Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) methodology and the FOBOS SCA framework to compare FPGA implementations of AES, SIMON, SPECK, PRESENT, LED, and TWINE, using a choice of architecture targeted to optimize throughput-to-area (TP/A) ratio and suitable for introducing countermeasures to Differential Power Analysis (DPA). We then apply an equivalent level of protection to the above ciphers using 3-share threshold implementations (TI) and verify the improved resistance to DPA. We find that SIMON has the highest absolute TP/A ratio of protected versions, as well as the lowest relative cost of protection in terms of TP/A ratio. Additionally, PRESENT uses the least energy per bit (E/bit) of all protected implementations, while AES has the lowest relative cost of protection in terms of increased E/bit.",16

Glitch detection in hardware implementations on FPGAs using delay based sampling techniques,"Rajesh Velegalati, Kinjal Shah, Jens-Peter Kaps",2013/9/4,Conference 2013 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design,"Glitches are the spurious signal transitions, which occur due to unbalanced path delays at the inputs of a gate. Presence of glitches in a digital system increases the number of signal transitions, thereby increasing the dynamic power consumption of the system. Consequently, overall power consumption, a major design criteria of a digital system, is increased. Furthermore, glitches are shown to be a source of side-channel leakage and can be exploited to enhance the success rate of power analysis attacks against cryptographic applications even in presence of side-channel countermeasures.

With ten finalists remaining, side-channel resistance and its effect on the performance and cost of practical implementations become of utmost importance. In this paper, we propose a general framework for evaluating side-channel resistance of LWC candidates using resources, experience, and general practices of the cryptographic engineering community developed over the last two decades. The primary features of our approach are a) self-identification and self-characterization of side-channel security evaluation labs, b) distributed development of protected software and hardware implementations, matching certain high-level requirements and deliverable formats, and c) dynamic and transparent matching of evaluators with implementers in order to achieve the most meaningful and fair evaluation reports.",1

Implementation and Benchmarking of Padding Units and HMAC for SHA-3 Candidates in FPGAs and ASICs,Ambarish Vyas,2012/2/2,"Description In 2005, a major security  flaw was discovered in Secure Hash Algorithm-1 (SHA-1), an NSA-designed cryptographic hash function, standardized by National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) since 1995. Basic components in the more recent NIST standard SHA-2, introduced in 2002, are quite similar to SHA-1. As both functions are quite similar, it is prudent to expect that the equivalent attacks can be found against SHA-2 in the future. In retort to this possibility, NIST established a contest in search of a new cryptographic hash function family called SHA-3. Presently, the competition is in Round 3 evaluations, with 5 finalists shortlisted out of the 14 from Round 2. Various research groups from the cryptographic community are evaluating the performance of the  finalists in hardware while trying their best to be fair in their design decisions. One of the topic of debate in the cryptographic community is whether padding should be included in hardware design or should it be done externally in software and not taken in consideration while evaluating the designs. We propose that padding should be included in the designs for fair evaluations, but should be designed intelligently so that the overall Throughput/Area ratio is not affected by an undesirable amount. In this thesis, we design and implement padding units for 5 Round 3 SHA 3  finalists for two hardware platforms, FPGAs and ASICs. We show that the worst effect of padding unit on the performance of the candidates does not exceed 18% in FPGAs and the overall ranking of the finalists does not change from the ranking derived from the architectures which do not support padding. Universal …","In 2005, a major security  flaw was discovered in Secure Hash Algorithm-1 (SHA-1), an NSA-designed cryptographic hash function, standardized by National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) since 1995. Basic components in the more recent NIST standard SHA-2, introduced in 2002, are quite similar to SHA-1. As both functions are quite similar, it is prudent to expect that the equivalent attacks can be found against SHA-2 in the future. In retort to this possibility, NIST established a contest in search of a new cryptographic hash function family called SHA-3. Presently, the competition is in Round 3 evaluations, with 5 finalists shortlisted out of the 14 from Round 2. Various research groups from the cryptographic community are evaluating the performance of the  finalists in hardware while trying their best to be fair in their design decisions. One of the topic of debate in the cryptographic community is whether padding should be included in hardware design or should it be done externally in software and not taken in consideration while evaluating the designs. We propose that padding should be included in the designs for fair evaluations, but should be designed intelligently so that the overall Throughput/Area ratio is not affected by an undesirable amount. In this thesis, we design and implement padding units for 5 Round 3 SHA 3  finalists for two hardware platforms, FPGAs and ASICs. We show that the worst effect of padding unit on the performance of the candidates does not exceed 18% in FPGAs and the overall ranking of the finalists does not change from the ranking derived from the architectures which do not support padding.

Athena–automated tool for hardware evaluation: Toward fair and comprehensive benchmarking of cryptographic algorithms using fpgas,"Kris Gaj, Jens-Peter Kaps, Venkata Amirineni, Marcin Rogawski, Ekawat Homsirikamol",2010,Publisher Aug-Sep,"In this talk, we will introduce an open-source en vironment, called ATHENa for fair, comprehensive, automated, and collaborative hardware benchmarking of cryptographic al gorithms. We believe that this environment is very suitable for use in evaluation of hardware performance of SHA-3 candidates from the point of view of speed, resource utilization, cost, power consumption, etc. At this point, the environment supports the evaluation using several families of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) from two major vendors, Xilinx and Altera. The environment is accompanied by a comprehensive website and database of results. We encourage all FPGA benchmarking teams to use our environment in their evaluations of SHA-3 candidates, and share their results, constraint files, testbenches, test vectors, and possibly even source codes using our web site. All results will be displayed in the form of the web based interactive tables permitting searching, filtering, ranking, and organizing multiple sets of data from various groups. All results pertaining to the comparison of the SHA-3 candidates, collected by the time of the conference, will be summarized and highlighted in our talk. This way, the presented ranking of Round 2 SHA-3 candidates will be based on the best results available for each candidate, rather than results obtained by a single group. In the future, in collaboration with other groups, we are planning to extend our database of results to cover the results for ASIC and software implementations, and allow the comparison of selected universal performance measures, such as maximum throughput, across multiple technologies.",1

"Side-Channel Resistant Implementations of Three Finalists of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography Standardization Process: Elephant, TinyJAMBU, and Xoodyak","Abubakr Abdulgadir, Richard Haeussler, Sammy Lin, Jens-Peter Kaps, Kris Gaj",2022/5,"Description Lightweight authenticated ciphers are crucial in many resource-constrained applications, including online payments and the Internet of Things. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) coordinates a standardization process, currently in Round 3, to select lightweight algorithms for such applications. Although security is paramount, cost, performance, and resistance to side-channel attacks are among the most critical selection criteria. This paper investigates the effect of applying side-channel countermeasures on the cost and performance of three NIST Lightweight Cryptography Finalists: Elephant, TinyJAMBU, and Xoodyak. For all investigated algorithms, we apply Domain-Oriented Masking. We then compare the cost of protection in terms of resource utilization and performance. Our first-order protected designs of Elephant, TinyJAMBU, and Xoodyak occupy 5451, 1267, and 6431 LUTs and have a throughput of 93, 120, and 891 Mbps, respectively, when implemented on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs.","Lightweight authenticated ciphers are crucial in many resource-constrained applications, including online payments and the Internet of Things.

Breaking down the barriers of using strong authentication and encryption in resource constrained embedded systems,"Ron Knobler, Peter Scheffel, Scott Jackson, Kris Gaj, Jens Peter Kaps",2013/5/28,"Conference Mobile Multimedia/Image Processing, Security, and Applications 2013","Various embedded systems, such as unattended ground sensors (UGS), are deployed in dangerous areas, where they are subject to compromise. Since numerous systems contain a network of devices that communicate with each other (often times with commercial off the shelf [COTS] radios), an adversary is able to intercept messages between system devices, which jeopardizes sensitive information transmitted by the system (e.g. location of system devices). Secret key algorithms such as AES are a very common means to encrypt all system messages to a sufficient security level, for which lightweight implementations exist for even very resource constrained devices. However, all system devices must use the appropriate key to encrypt and decrypt messages from each other. While traditional public key algorithms (PKAs), such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), provide a sufficiently secure means to …",
Solving data-at-rest for the storage and retrieval of files in ad hoc networks,"Ron Knobler, Peter Scheffel, Jonathan Williams, Kris Gaj, Jens-Peter Kaps",2013/5/28,"Conference Mobile Multimedia/Image Processing, Security, and Applications 2013","Based on current trends for both military and commercial applications, the use of mobile devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets) is greatly increasing. Several military applications consist of secure peer to peer file sharing without a centralized authority. For these military applications, if one or more of these mobile devices are lost or compromised, sensitive files can be compromised by adversaries, since COTS devices and operating systems are used. Complete system files cannot be stored on a device, since after compromising a device, an adversary can attack the data at rest, and eventually obtain the original file. Also after a device is compromised, the existing peer to peer system devices must still be able to access all system files.

Preliminary Analysis of the Effectiveness of Correlating with Band-limited Coded Sequences for Improving the Resolvability of Closely Spaced Echoes in an Air-coupled Ultrasonic …,"Mark Chaney, Kris Gaj, Jens-Peter Kaps, Jill Nelson",2012,Institution George Mason University,"Ultrasonic ranging systems that are vulnerable to crosstalk often use coded sequences to reduce the effects of crosstalk. Correlation of the received waveform with each of the known code sequences disambiguates the source of the transmission. As the transmitted waves reflect off of the surrounding surfaces, a multitude of phases are received which appear as multiple peaks in the correlation surface. When the phases are too closely spaced, the peaks may blend together and appear to be a single peak to the detection algorithm. For an unfiltered non-return-to-zero (NRZ) pseudorandom sequence, the resolvability of each of the phases in the correlation surface is roughly dependent on the rate at which the coded sequence is transmitted. The resolvability may be improved by increasing the transmission rate, and therefore also bandwidth requirements. However, there are limits to increasing the transmission rate …",
