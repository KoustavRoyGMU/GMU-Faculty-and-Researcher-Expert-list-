Chronic monitoring of lower urinary tract activity via a sacral dorsal root ganglia interface.,"A Khurram, S Ross, Z Sperry, A Ouyang, C Stephan, A Jiman, TM Bruns",2017/3/21,Journal Journal of neural engineering,"Objective. Our goal is to develop an interface that integrates chronic monitoring of lower urinary tract (LUT) activity with stimulation of peripheral pathways. Approach. Penetrating microelectrodes were implanted in sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of adult male felines. Peripheral electrodes were placed on or in the pudendal nerve, bladder neck and near the external urethral sphincter. Supra-pubic bladder catheters were implanted for saline infusion and pressure monitoring. Electrode and catheter leads were enclosed in an external housing on the back. Neural signals from microelectrodes and bladder pressure of sedated or awake-behaving felines were recorded under various test conditions in weekly sessions. Electrodes were also stimulated to drive activity. Main results. LUT single-and multi-unit activity was recorded for 4–11 weeks in four felines. As many as 18 unique bladder pressure single-units were …",36
Evaluation of decoding algorithms for estimating bladder pressure from dorsal root ganglia neural recordings,"Shani E Ross, Zhonghua Ouyang, Sai Rajagopalan, Tim M Bruns",2018/2,Journal Annals of biomedical engineering,"A closed-loop device for bladder control may offer greater clinical benefit compared to current open-loop stimulation devices. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using single-unit recordings from sacral-level dorsal root ganglia (DRG) for decoding bladder pressure. Automatic online sorting, to differentiate single units, can be computationally heavy and unreliable, in contrast to simple multi-unit thresholded activity. In this study, the feasibility of using DRG multi-unit recordings to decode bladder pressure was examined. A broad range of feature selection methods and three algorithms (multivariate linear regression, basic Kalman filter, and a nonlinear autoregressive moving average model) were used to create training models and provide validation fits to bladder pressure for data collected in seven anesthetized feline experiments. A non-linear autoregressive moving average (NARMA …",25
Deep brain stimulation in the central nucleus of the amygdala decreases ‘wanting’and ‘liking’of food rewards,"Shani E Ross, Emily Lehmann Levin, Christy A Itoga, Chelsea B Schoen, Romeissa Selmane, J Wayne Aldridge",2016/10,Journal European Journal of Neuroscience,"We investigated the potential of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in rats to modulate functional reward mechanisms. The CeA is the major output of the amygdala with direct connections to the hypothalamus and gustatory brainstem, and indirect connections with the nucleus accumbens. Further, the CeA has been shown to be involved in learning, emotional integration, reward processing, and regulation of feeding. We hypothesized that DBS, which is used to treat movement disorders and other brain dysfunctions, might block reward motivation. In rats performing a lever‐pressing task to obtain sugar pellet rewards, we stimulated the CeA and control structures, and compared stimulation parameters. During CeA stimulation, animals stopped working for rewards and rejected freely available rewards. Taste reactivity testing during DBS exposed aversive reactions to normally …",23
Hysteretic behavior of bladder afferent neurons in response to changes in bladder pressure,"Shani E Ross, Zachariah J Sperry, Colin M Mahar, Tim M Bruns",2016/8/12,Journal BMC Neuroscience,"Mechanosensitive afferents innervating the bladder increase their firing rate as the bladder fills and pressure rises. However, the relationship between afferent firing rates and intravesical pressure is not a simple linear one. Firing rate responses to pressure can differ depending on prior activity, demonstrating hysteresis in the system. Though this hysteresis has been commented on in published literature, it has not been quantified. Sixty-six bladder afferents recorded from sacral dorsal root ganglia in five alpha-chloralose anesthetized felines were identified based on their characteristic responses to pressure (correlation coefficient ≥ 0.2) during saline infusion (2 ml/min). For saline infusion trials, we calculated a maximum hysteresis ratio between the firing rate difference at each pressure and the overall firing rate range (or Hmax) of 0.86 ± 0.09 (mean ± standard deviation) and mean hysteresis ratio (or Hmean) of 0.52 ± 0.13 (n = 46 afferents). For isovolumetric trials in two experiments (n = 33 afferents) Hmax was 0.72 ± 0.14 and Hmean was 0.40 ± 0.14. A comprehensive state model that integrates these hysteresis parameters to determine the bladder state may improve upon existing neuroprostheses for bladder control.",14
Time-frequency analysis of increases in vaginal blood perfusion elicited by long-duration pudendal neuromodulation in anesthetized rats,"Indie C Rice, Lauren L Zimmerman, Shani E Ross, Mitchell B Berger, Tim M Bruns",2017/12/1,Journal Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface,"Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) affects a significant portion of the population. Although treatment options for FSD are limited, neuromodulation for bladder dysfunction has improved sexual function in some women. A few studies have investigated peripheral neuromodulation for eliciting changes in vaginal blood flow, as a proxy for modulating genital sexual arousal, however results are generally transient. Our central hypothesis is that repeated or extended-duration pudendal nerve stimulation can elicit maintained vaginal blood flow increases.",10
Online handwritten circuit recognition on a Tablet PC,"O'tega Ejofodomi, Shani Ross, Ahmed Jendoubi, Mohamed Chouikha, Jianchao Zeng",2004/10/13,Conference 33rd Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR'04),"Tablet PC-based engineering software can be used as an effective teaching tool for core engineering courses such as electronics, signal and systems, and digital systems. Wireless connection between tablet PCs of students and the teaching professor will substantially improve students' involvement during the course. Circuit drawing is an important task especially in undergraduate courses such as electronics and digital systems. Most existing software tools for circuit drawing use a toolbox where symbols for all circuit components are prepared and ready for pick up. A user has to go through a number of layers of menus each time he/she wants to use a circuit symbol. To improve human computer interaction, we have developed an online recognition system on a tablet PC using C# for the handwritten circuit and its components. The system can recognize and redraw many circuits and their components such as …",5
Laminar analysis of movement direction information in local field potentials of the rat motor cortex,"Gregory J Gage, Chie Kawahara, Shani E Ross, Timothy C Marzullo, Daryl R Kipke",2006/8/30,Conference 2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,"Local field potentials (LFPs) have been proposed for use in controlling neural prosthetic devices because they can provide reliable motor and sensory-related information, and can easily be recorded over long periods of time. While studies have shown that directional information about motor movements can be inferred from LFPs, it is not known at what depth these signals should be recorded from in order to maximize the amount of movement information. Towards this end, we used a directional motor task in Long Evans rats, while sampling LFPs with an electrode consisting of 16 vertical recording sites that were evenly-spaced 1004462326m apart. This allowed for simultaneous recording of all layers of the motor cortex. The frequency components of LFPs were then analyzed using k-means clustering to determine directional information as a function of depth. Here we report our initial findings that superficial layers …",2
"Sedimentation of Crystals in Hard-Sphere, Monodisperse Colloidal Suspensions",Shani Ross,2003,Journal Howard University. Washington,"Several well-known substances of practical importance exist as colloids in nondensity matched suspensions, yet very little research is done on such suspensions. This paper investigates the effects of gravity on crystals in hard-sphere, monodisperse colloidal suspensions. Samples of PMMA–PHSA hard spheres of volume fractions between 49.4% and 54.5%(which indicates the coexistence region) in index-matched solvents are allowed to crystallize and then inverted and observed using confocal microscopy. The results for the density-mismatched sample used will show non-uniform melting at the crystal-liquid interface, instead of the whole crystal falling through the sample.",2
"The Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation in the Ventral Pallidum and the Central Nucelus of the Amygdala on Food Consumption, Motivation, and Palatability.",Shani Elizabeth Ross,2013,"Description Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been shown to be an effective treatment for Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders including essential tremor and dystonia.  Given its success, DBS is also being investigated as a potential treatment for psychiatric disorders including depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and addiction.  Although the specific therapeutic mechanisms of DBS are not known, studies suggest that this type of electrical stimulation may be causing an entrainment or regularization of firing patterns in neurons, interfering with the information being processed in the underlying neural circuit.  The overall goal of this thesis is to evaluate the potential neural interference effects of DBS-like stimulation on motivation and reward consumption.  Two structures were targeted: the ventral pallidum (VP), which is thought to be an area of convergence for processing reward and reward-related information, and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), which is thought to be especially involved in focusing motivation for particular cues and rewards.  The effects on DBS in the VP and CeA on reward-seeking behaviors, food consumption, and hedonic value of tastes were assessed.  Results showed that DBS in the VP produced complex patterns of neuronal firing; however, it did not disrupt neural coding of reward and had only minimal effects on food consumption and motivation.  DBS in the CeA also resulted in similar complex firing patterns, and additionally (in contrast to the VP) disrupted neural coding of reward.  This disruption was reflected in altered behavior.  DBS in the CeA invoked an immediate and profound …","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been shown to be an effective treatment for Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders including essential tremor and dystonia.

Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Taste Reactivity in the Central Medial Nucleus of the Amygdala,Romeissa Selmane,2012,"Description Alterations to the hedonic value of food could be an underlying cause of obesity. To assess the hedonic impact, a taste reactivity test, which is sensitive to the palatability of food and dissociable from sensory processes, was used. In this preliminary study, we measured hedonic and aversive taste reactions to oral infusions of sucrose, water and quinine during deep brain stimulation of the central medial nucleus of the amygdala (CeM). It was hypothesized that stimulation of the CeM will decrease the hedonic impact to a sucrose solution while increasing the aversive impact to a quinine solution. Since this was a preliminary study with a small sample size, no strong conclusion can be made. However, the results hint that an aversive state was experienced by the rats. An increase in aversive taste reactions and a decrease in hedonic reactions were observed. During taste infusions, an increase in aversive responses to sucrose was seen. Even the small number of positive facial reactions to water decreased. These findings suggest deep brain stimulation in the central amygdala may be creating an overall aversive state in the rat. With further work, an experiment such as this can be useful in understanding how brain stimulation could be used as a treatment for morbid obesity.","Alterations to the hedonic value of food could be an underlying cause of obesity.
