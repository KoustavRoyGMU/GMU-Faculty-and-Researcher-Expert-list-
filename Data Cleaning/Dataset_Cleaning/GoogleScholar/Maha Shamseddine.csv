bwslicer: A bandwidth slicing framework for cloud data centers,"Auday Al-Dulaimy, Wassim Itani, Javid Taheri, Maha Shamseddine",2020/11/1,Journal Future Generation Computer Systems,"Bandwidth allocation is an important and influential factor in enhancing the performance of the data centers’ nodes. In this paper we propose bwSlicer, a framework for bandwidth slicing in cloud data centers, that sheds light on the virtues of effective dynamic bandwidth allocation on improving the system performance and energy efficiency. Three algorithms are investigated to deal with this issue. In the first algorithm, called Fair Bandwidth Reallocation (FBR), two virtual machines co-hosted on the same node conditionally exchange bandwidth slices based on their requirements. The second algorithm, called Required Bandwidth Allocation (RBA), periodically monitors the co-hosted virtual machines and adds/removes bandwidth slices for each of them based on their bandwidth utilization. The third algorithm, called Divide Bandwidth Reallocation (DBR), divides the bandwidth of the virtual machine into slices once it …",9
Virtualized network views for localizing misbehaving sources in SDN data planes,"Maha Shamseddine, Wassim Itani, Ayman Kayssi, Ali Chehab",2017/5/21,Conference 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),"In this paper, we present VISKA, a Cloud security service for detecting malicious switching elements in software defined networking (SDN) environments. VISKA leverages network virtualization and secure probabilistic sketching to isolate misbehaving switches in the underlying SDN network data plane. The main contribution lies in utilizing network virtualization in SDN environments to dynamically isolate parts of the data plane and check their forwarding behavior. This is achieved by applying a set of focused packet probing and sketching mechanisms on virtualized network views mapped to these data plane partitions instead of focusing the security mechanisms on the whole physical network. VISKA flexibly analyzes the network behavior of the granular virtual views and recursively partitions these views to reduce the problem size in order to localize abnormal/malicious network switching units.

A virtual QoS-adaptive network connectivity service: An SDN approach,"Maha Shamseddine, Imad Elhajj, Ali Chehab, Ayman Kayssi",2016/11/2,Conference 2016 IEEE International Multidisciplinary Conference on Engineering Technology (IMCET),In this paper we propose the design and implementation of a software-defined networking (SDN)-based quality of service (QoS)-adaptive connectivity service for real-time network communication. The main contribution in this work lies in utilizing the network virtualization function of SDN to “elastically” provide network connectivity solutions that suit and adapt to the QoS requirements of different network services. This provides a better performance and communication response for performance-critical/emergency service deployments. The proposed algorithm utilizes priority grouping of open flow switches and periodically checks the number of flows processed by the switch to reassign priority groups. The proposed algorithm (VQoS) is leveraged to minimize the network delay and round-trip times and to enhance network utilization. VQoS is tested via simulation using a Mininet test bed on top of the OpenVirtex SDN …,4
Privacy-aware job submission in the cloud,"Auday Al-Dulaimy, Wassim Itani, Maha Shamseddine, Javid Taheri",2019/11/19,Conference 2019 2nd IEEE Middle East and North Africa COMMunications Conference (MENACOMM),"The services offered by cloud computing are provided to individuals and organizations by varied shared resources which are forming the hardware layer of cloud data centers. Cloud users do not deal or interact directly with those resources, instead, they deal with the virtualized version of them, in other words, users deal with the virtualization layer which conceals to a great extent the specifics of the physical hardware layer. Based on the virtualization concept, more than one virtual machine can be co-hosted on the same physical machine. In spite of the wide range of benefits, co-hosting virtual machines on the same host comes with privacy and security threats. From one side, cloud providers are serving the virtual machines without being aware of their contents. On the other side, once cloud users submit their jobs to be serviced in the cloud, they lose their control on their jobs' sensitive information. Thus, cloud users …",2
Mitigating rogue node attacks in edge computing,"Maha Shamseddine, Wassim Itani, Auday Al-Dulaimy, Javid Taheri",2019/11/19,Conference 2019 2nd IEEE Middle East and North Africa COMMunications Conference (MENACOMM),"In this work, we present a secure authentication protocol for edge computing using the Software-Defined Networking platform and wireless network virtualization. The main contribution of the presented protocol lies in: (1) designing and implementing a practical solution to the security problem of rogue Fog nodes, and (2) providing the cloud service provider with exclusive control over the security configuration and specification of its leased virtual networks independent of the security mechanisms implemented by the underlying infrastructure provider. The cloud provider dynamically enforces its security policies on the communication at the network edge, therefore circumventing any possible security vulnerabilities in the underlying physical wireless infrastructure. The authentication protocol manages the trusted communication among the mobile client, the infrastructure provider, and the cloud service provider, yet …",2
Network programming and probabilistic sketching for securing the data plane,"Maha Shamseddine, Wassim Itani, Ali Chehab, Ayman Kayssi",2018/1/1,Journal Security and Communication Networks,"This paper presents VISKA, a cloud security service for dynamically detecting malicious switching elements in software defined networking (SDN) infrastructures. The main contributions of VISKA lie in (1) utilizing network programming and secure probabilistic sketching in SDN environments to dynamically detect and isolate parts of the data plane that experience malicious behavior, (2) applying a set of focused packet probing and sketching mechanisms on isolated network partitions/views rather than focusing the security mechanisms on the whole physical network, (3) efficiently analyzing the network behavior of the resulting views by recursively partitioning them in a divide-and-conquer fashion to logarithmically reduce the problem size in order to localize abnormal/malicious switching units, and (4) providing an attack categorization module that analyzes live ingress/egress traffic of the maliciously detected switch(es) solely to identify the specific type of attack, rather than inspecting the whole network traffic as is done in traditional intrusion detection systems. This significantly enhances the performance of attack detection and reduces the load on the controller. A testbed prototype implementation is realized on the Mininet network emulator. The experimental analysis corroborated the algorithms’ convergence property using the linear and FatTree topologies with network sizes of up to 250 switches. Moreover, an implementation of the attack categorization module is realized and achieved an accuracy rate of over 90% for the different attack types supported.",2
Nodeguard: A Virtualized Introspection Security Approach for the Modern Cloud Data Center,"Maha Shamseddine, Auday Al-Dulaimy, Wassim Itani, Thomas Nolte, Alessandro V Papadopoulos",2022/5/16,"Conference 2022 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid)","This paper presents Nodeguard, a security approach for detecting and isolating misbehaving Virtual Machines (VMs) in multi-tenant virtualized cloud data centers, based on the Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) monitoring primitives. Nodeguard employs a divide-and-conquer strategy that checks logical groups of VMs to ensure the efficiency of the detection mechanisms which opportunistically approaches a complexity of  when there is a relatively low number of hostile VMs. This greatly enhances the algorithmic time complexity of the pro-posed security system compared to the  complexity achieved by the traditional VMI inspection strategy that checks each VM separately. The approach has been evaluated in a virtualized cloud environment using the Mininet network emulator.",1
VNCS: virtual network connectivity as a service a software-defined networking approach,"Maha Shamseddine, Imad Elhajj, Ali Chehab, Ayman Kayssi",2016/4/4,Conference 2016 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering Workshop (IC2EW),"This paper presents VNCS (Virtual Network Connectivity as a Service), a network service that connects geographically separated enterprise branches based on the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) infrastructure. The VNCS service creates and manages Virtual SDNs (vSDN) for the tenant's sites that are logically decoupled from the network infrastructure, providing configurable network topology and isolation on the SDN network virtualization platform. VNCS service algorithms ensure the dynamic spawning of the tenant specified vSDN that satisfies its constraints with minimum connection cost based on the SDN providers' offers and tenant's specifications and preferences that are inputs to the VNCS algorithms interface. VNCS enables tenants to specify how their remote sites are to be connected along with a list of network constraints independently from the service provider and the infrastructure provider. The …",1
Security-Aware Node Replacements and Incremental Updates in Industrial IoT Platforms,"Wassim Itani, Maha Shamseddine, Elisha J Hosey-Stewart",2022/12/4,Conference GLOBECOM 2022-2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference,"IIoT is the industrial tier of the Internet of Things initiative characterized by stringent security requirements, high sensor fault rates, and frequent mission-critical software updates. In this work, we propose the design and implementation of two security-aware protocols for node replacements and incremental software updates in IIoT. The node replacement protocol ensures the legitimacy of newly added replacement sensors by coordinating an efficient key management procedure to refresh their cryptographic keying material without the need of resource-intensive public-key cryptographic techniques. This is done by leveraging private secret sharing protocols and relying on the already established security associations between the IoT gateway and neighboring sensor nodes. The node update protocol supports multi-component software updates on the IIoT sensors and ensures their authenticity using probabilistic set …",
STCCS: Segmented Time Controlled Count-Min Sketch,"Ismail Khram, Maha Shamseddine, Wassim Itani",2020/12/7,Conference 2020 ITU Kaleidoscope: Industry-Driven Digital Transformation (ITU K),"IoT is a concept consisting of many components powered by different techniques and technologies. However, due to computation restrictions, encryption algorithms had to be adapted, often at the expense of lower data security levels and strength. To maintain data privacy between source and sink we present in this paper a data sketching algorithm that utilizes bandwidth by providing a summary of the data to the cloud. The input data stream goes through a hashing algorithm which produces a hexadecimal representation of the data before going through the sketching algorithm. At the algorithm the data is categorized and the corresponding hash cell value updated. Note is also taken of the arrival time of the data considered anomalous to allow the manager to take corrective action if it is deduced that the periodic appearance of the information is successive in nature.",

Service provisioning in virtualized and programmable network environments.,Maha Nizam Shamseddine,2018,"Description This work tackles the ossification and complexity problem of communication networks in terms of management, configuration, control, connection and security. These complexities are as a result of the great dependencies on network hardware and vendor-specific operation. In order to support the evolving nature of new networking technologies and the introduction of IoT, Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, Fog Computing, 5G, among others, the network must be transformed to a more flexible, agile, dynamic, and multi-tenant infrastructure. This work addresses the demand for a new networking platform that is capable of adapting to the quick pace imposed by the evolution of the digital world and its communication. Towards the afore elaborated challenge, the work in this thesis addresses the provisioning of new protocols and networking services that would provide a more suitable platform and foundation for the developing communication world. To achieve dynamically reconfigurable and extensible network platforms, network softwarization and virtualization are utilized to provide advanced networking structures and services. The proposed set of networking services that would fulfill the work profound goals include: (1) simplified network management, configuration, and control.

NCaaS relieves tenants from the burdens and complexities of VNet creation and management by supporting dynamic provisioning operations based on Quality of Service (QoS), pricing, privacy, reliability, and energy constraints set by the tenant. NCaaS provides a unified interface through which tenants' network specifications and constraints are fed into the service provisioning algorithms. These algorithms, in turn, handle the negotiation with the different SDN Network as a Service (NaaS) providers and dynamically apply the necessary VNet creation, partitioning, and migration mechanisms to ensure the satisfaction of the tenants' preferences.
