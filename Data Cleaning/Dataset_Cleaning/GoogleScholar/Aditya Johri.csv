Situated engineering learning: Bridging engineering education research and the learning sciences,"Aditya Johri, Barbara M Olds",2011/1,Journal Journal of Engineering Education,"Contributors Indigo Esmonde, University of Toronto; Krishna Madhavan, Purdue University; Wolff‐Michael Roth, University of Victoria; Dan L. Schwartz and Jessica Tsang, Stanford University; Estrid Sørensen, Humboldt University and Aarhus University; Iris Tabak, Ben Gurion University of the Negev Background The field of engineering education research has seen substantial growth in the last five years but it often lacks theoretical and empirical work on engineering learning that could be supplied by the learning sciences. In addition, the learning sciences have focused very little on engineering learning to date. Purpose This article summarizes prior work in the learning sciences and discusses one perspective—situative learning—in depth. Situativity refers to the central role of context, including the physical and social aspects of the environment, on learning. Furthermore, it emphasizes the socially and culturally …",473
On the development of a professional identity: Engineering persisters vs engineering switchers,"Olga Pierrakos, Thi Kay Beam, Jamie Constantz, Aditya Johri, Robin Anderson",2009/10/18,Conference 2009 39th IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference,"Decline in engineering enrollment continues and renewed efforts are required to improve enrollment and diversity. Herein, we address this problem by conducting research to understand engineering students through the lens of identity theory. Implications of this effort are twofold: (1) to contribute to our basic understanding of engineering students' identities as well as what factors (experiences and settings) foster the formation and transformation of these identities during the undergraduate experience, and from these findings (2) to gain insight into improving recruitment and retention of engineering students, particularly students underrepresented in engineering. By conducting focus groups and interviews, our goal was to understand professional identity development in freshman engineering persisters and freshman engineering switchers. Initial findings suggest that exposure to meaningful engineering-related …",250
Uses and gratifications of pokémon go: Why do people play mobile location-based augmented reality games?,"Juho Hamari, Aqdas Malik, Johannes Koski, Aditya Johri",2019/5/28,Journal International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction,"In recent years, augmented reality games (ARGs) such as Pokémon Go have become increasingly popular. These games not only afford a novel gaming experience but also have the potential to alter how players view their physical realities. In addition to the common experiences and gratifications people derive from games, (location-based) ARGs can afford, for example outdoor adventures, communal activities, and health benefits, but also create problems stemming from, for example privacy concerns and poor usability. This raises some important research questions as to what drives people to use these new applications, and why they may be willing to spend money on the content sold within them. In this study, we investigate the various gratifications people derive from ARGs (Pokémon Go) and the relationship of these gratifications with the players’ intentions to continue playing and spending money on them …",184
Professional engineering work,"Reed Stevens, Aditya Johri, Kevin O’connor",2014,Journal Cambridge handbook of engineering education research,"The focus of our chapter is on current research-based understandings of professional engineering work. We argue for the relevance of these understandings to engineering education. We will also argue, as others have as well (Barley, 2004; Trevelyan, 2007, 2010; Vinck, 2003), that research on professional engineering work is too sparse. Therefore a good part of this chapter is oriented in a programmatic, agenda setting direction.",156
Next-term student performance prediction: A recommender systems approach,"Mack Sweeney, Huzefa Rangwala, Jaime Lester, Aditya Johri",2016/4/7,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.01840,"An enduring issue in higher education is student retention to successful graduation. National statistics indicate that most higher education institutions have four-year degree completion rates around 50 percent, or just half of their student populations. While there are prediction models which illuminate what factors assist with college student success, interventions that support course selections on a semester-to-semester basis have yet to be deeply understood. To further this goal, we develop a system to predict students' grades in the courses they will enroll in during the next enrollment term by learning patterns from historical transcript data coupled with additional information about students, courses and the instructors teaching them. We explore a variety of classic and state-of-the-art techniques which have proven effective for recommendation tasks in the e-commerce domain. In our experiments, Factorization Machines (FM), Random Forests (RF), and the Personalized Multi-Linear Regression model achieve the lowest prediction error. Application of a novel feature selection technique is key to the predictive success and interpretability of the FM. By comparing feature importance across populations and across models, we uncover strong connections between instructor characteristics and student performance. We also discover key differences between transfer and non-transfer students. Ultimately we find that a hybrid FM-RF method can be used to accurately predict grades for both new and returning students taking both new and existing courses. Application of these techniques holds promise for student degree planning, instructor interventions …",153
The socio-materiality of learning practices and implications for the field of learning technology.,Aditya Johri,2011,Journal Research in Learning Technology,"Although the use of digital information technologies in education has become commonplace, there are few, if any, central guiding frameworks or theories that explicate the relationship between technology and learning practices. In this paper, I argue that such a theoretical framework can assist scholars and practitioners alike by working as a conduit to study and design learning technologies. Towards this goal, I propose socio-materiality as a key theoretical construct with valuable insights and implications for the field of learning technology. Socio-materiality helps balance the disproportionate attention given to either the social implications of technology use or the material aspects of technology design. Furthermore, I forward",137

The Handbook draws extensively on contemporary research in the learning sciences, examining how technology affects learners and learning environments, and the role of social context in learning. Since a landmark issue of the Journal of Engineering Education (2005), in which senior scholars argued for a stronger theoretical and empirically driven agenda, engineering education has quickly emerged as a research-driven field increasing in both theoretical and empirical work drawing on many social science disciplines, disciplinary engineering knowledge, and computing. The Handbook is based on the research agenda from a series of interdisciplinary colloquia funded by the US National Science Foundation and published in the Journal of Engineering Education in October 2006.",136
Needle in a haystack: Identifying learner posts that require urgent response in MOOC discussion forums,"Omaima Almatrafi, Aditya Johri, Huzefa Rangwala",2018/3/1,Journal Computers & Education,"Although massive open online courses or MOOCs have been successful in attracting a large number of learners, they have not been equally successful in retaining the learners to the point of course completion. One critical point of failure in many courses, especially those that use discussion forums as a means of collaborative learning, is the large number of messages exchanged on the forums. The extensive exchange of messages often creates chaos from the instructors' perspective and several questions remain unanswered. Lack of attention and response to urgent messages – those that are critical from the learners’ perspective to move forward – becomes a major challenge in this environment. This paper proposes a model to identify “urgent” posts that need immediate attention from instructors. In our analysis, we investigate different feature sets and different data mining techniques, and report the best set of …",120

Use of Twitter across educational settings: a review of the literature,"Aqdas Malik, Cassandra Heyman-Schrum, Aditya Johri",2019/12,Source International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,"The use of social media across the educational landscape is on the rise. Subsequently, the body of research on this topic is vibrant and growing. In this article, we present findings from a review of 103 peer-reviewed scientific studies published over the last decade (2007–2017) that address the use of Twitter for educational purposes across formal and informal settings. The majority of the studies reported in the literature are descriptive case studies carried out with students in North American and European higher education settings. Analysis of these studies signals Twitter as a useful tool for communication due to high accessibility, novelty, and real-time format. Students, teachers, and other stakeholders use it as a pedagogical tool to gain information, interact and engage with each other, participate in their respective communities of interests, and share their insights about specific topics.

Systematic review of discussion forums in massive open online courses (MOOCs),"Omaima Almatrafi, Aditya Johri",2018/7/24,Source IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,"Discussion forums are the primary and most widely used venue for social learning and communication in MOOC context. There has been an interest in the last few years to study the interactions and participation behavior in this environment. This systematic review studied eighty-four papers published between 2013-2017 to provide a state of the art, and suggest future directions in the literature from two perspectives: descriptive analysis and content analysis. The descriptive analysis aggregates the reviewed papers into five dimensions: time of the publication, stakeholders involved in the analysis, objectives, methods, and data sources used in the studies.

Situative frameworks for engineering learning research,"Aditya Johri, Barbara M Olds, Kevin O’Connor",2014,Journal Cambridge handbook of engineering education research,"There is increased concern with developing a better understanding of how people learn engineering, as prior efforts to improve engineering education have often followed an ad hoc trajectory. The field lacks a systematic understanding of how engineering learning occurs, and there is a paucity of knowledge on which to draw (Felder, Sheppard, & Smith, 2005; Chapter 1 by Froyd & Lohmann, this volume). To help redress this situation, in this chapter we review scholarship on learning with the aim of building a framework that can guide future research on engineering learning. Specifically, we hope to make the case for a framework that focuses on situativity and learning in engineering settings. This chapter complements other chapters in this volume including Chapters 2 by Newstetter and Svinicki; 4 by",88
Predicting performance on MOOC assessments using multi-regression models,"Zhiyun Ren, Huzefa Rangwala, Aditya Johri",2016/5/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.02269,"The past few years has seen the rapid growth of data min- ing approaches for the analysis of data obtained from Mas- sive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The objectives of this study are to develop approaches to predict the scores a stu- dent may achieve on a given grade-related assessment based on information, considered as prior performance or prior ac- tivity in the course. We develop a personalized linear mul- tiple regression (PLMR) model to predict the grade for a student, prior to attempting the assessment activity. The developed model is real-time and tracks the participation of a student within a MOOC (via click-stream server logs) and predicts the performance of a student on the next as- sessment within the course offering. We perform a com- prehensive set of experiments on data obtained from three openEdX MOOCs via a Stanford University initiative. Our experimental results show the promise of the proposed ap- proach in comparison to baseline approaches and also helps in identification of key features that are associated with the study habits and learning behaviors of students.",77
Capable and convivial design (CCD): a framework for designing information and communication technologies for human development,"Aditya Johri, Joyojeet Pal",2012/1/1,Journal Information Technology for Development,"Scholarship and implementation in information and communication technologies for development (ICTD/ICT4D) have seen an exponential increase over the past decade. In spite of enormous headway in both research and application, ICTD lacks a clear unified framework that can guide contextually grounded user-focussed design of ICT. This shortcoming results largely from the field's unusual placement at the intersection of research, policy, and practice, each driven by different philosophical traditions and application intentions. We argue that this gap can be overcome by adopting design-based approaches in ICTD. Towards this end, we advance a design framework – capable and convivial design (CCD) – that appropriates Sen's idea of capabilities and Illich's notion of conviviality. We contend that these two sets of complementary theoretical traditions are markedly well suited to guide the design of contextually …",72

Running out of stem: a comparative study across stem majors of college students at-risk of dropping out early,"Yujing Chen, Aditya Johri, Huzefa Rangwala",2018/3/7,Book Proceedings of the 8th international conference on learning analytics and knowledge,"Higher education institutions in the United States and across the Western world face a critical problem of attrition of college students and this problem is particularly acute within the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Students are especially vulnerable in the initial years of their academic programs; more than 60% of the dropouts occur in the first two years. Therefore, early identification of at-risk students is crucial for a focused intervention if institutions are to support students towards completion. In this paper we developed and evaluated a survival analysis framework for the early identification of students at the risk of dropping out. We compared the performance of survival analysis approaches to other machine learning approaches including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting. The proposed methods show good performance for early prediction of at-risk students and are …",71
Millennial engineers: Digital media and information ecology of engineering students,"Aditya Johri, Hon Jie Teo, Jenny Lo, Monique Dufour, Asta Schram",2014/4/1,Journal Computers in Human Behavior,"Media significantly shape how and what we learn. To date there is limited understanding of digital media and information use by engineering students. We comprehensively review existing literature and present findings from a research study investigating digital media and information use of ‘millennial’ engineers who purportedly possess distinctive experience, habits, and perceptions about technology. We administered a multiple-item survey to a cohort of first year engineering students who entered a large public university in the United States in August 2009. Self-reported information on the frequency of media device usage, participation in social networking, academic activities and information seeking tendencies, was received from 204 participants. Similar to other youth, millennial engineers use technology extensively and are frequent users of both commonly used digital devices as well as applications. Students …",70
Learning analytics tools in higher education: Adoption at the intersection of institutional commitment and individual action,"Carrie Klein, Jaime Lester, Huzefa Rangwala, Aditya Johri",2019,Journal The Review of Higher Education,"An instrumental case study was conducted at a large, public research university to understand the organizational barriers, incentives, and opportunities related to adoption of learning analytics tools by faculty members and professional advising staff. Data was culled from focus groups with six faculty and twenty-one advisors and from interview and observation sessions with two faculty and three advisors. Preliminary results indicate that organizational context and commitment, including structures, policies, processes, and leadership impact individual decisions to trust and adopt learning analytics tools. Further, results indicate the importance of a comprehensive, inclusive, and well-communicated implementation plan for maximum adoption by users.[End Page 565]",67
Learning analytics in higher education: ASHE Higher Education Report,"Jaime Lester, Carrie Klein, Huzefa Rangwala, Aditya Johri",2017/12/21,Publisher John Wiley & Sons,"Learning analytics (or educational big data) tools are increasingly being deployed on campuses to improve student performance, retention and completion, especially when those metrics are tied to funding. Providing personalized, real-time, actionable feedback through mining and analysis of large data sets, learning analytics can illuminate trends and predict future outcomes. While promising, there is limited and mixed empirical evidence related to its efficacy to improve student retention and completion. Further, learning analytics tools are used by a variety of people on campus, and as such, its use in practice may not align with institutional intent. This monograph delves into the research, literature, and issues associated with learning analytics implementation, adoption, and use by individuals within higher education institutions. With it, readers will gain a greater understanding of the potential and challenges related to implementing, adopting, and integrating these systems on their campuses and within their classrooms and advising sessions. This is the fifth issue of the 43rd volume of the Jossey-Bass series ASHE Higher Education Report. Each monograph is the definitive analysis of a tough higher education issue, based on thorough research of pertinent literature and institutional experiences. Topics are identified by a national survey. Noted practitioners and scholars are then commissioned to write the reports, with experts providing critical reviews of each manuscript before publication.",63
The role of representations in engineering practices: Taking a turn towards inscriptions,"Aditya Johri, Wolff-Michael Roth, Barbara M Olds",2013,Journal Journal of Engineering Education,"[...] representations are the foundation of design, which is an essential component of engineering (Dym et al., 2005).[...] the objective nature of the hard sciences (including mathematics, engineering, and technology) is possible only because of the material nature of inscriptions; without these, the sciences would be totally subjective (Husserl, 1939).",62
Preliminary findings on freshmen engineering students’ professional identity: Implications for recruitment and retention,"TK Beam, Olga Pierrakos, Jamie Constantz, Aditya Johri, Robin Anderson",2009/6/14,Conference 2009 Annual Conference & Exposition,"Despite a significant increase in efforts to recruit and retain more engineering students through initiatives such as learning communities, mentoring, and pre-college programs, the decline in engineering enrollment continues. Recent research suggests that students’ identity and identification with engineering plays a critical role in their decision to pursue engineering and to persist once they start their professional education. This study further examines the role of identity among freshmen engineering students through the lens of identity theory. Whereas prior work focused on the development of a singular engineering identity, we draw on current research in social psychology to investigate the multi-faceted nature of identity, with one person being able to maintain several identities simultaneously, and its role in recruitment and retention. We undertook a qualitative study and conducted a combination of focus groups and interviews (N= 36), focusing on engineering, science, and non-STEM students, including students who switched out of engineering. Questions were directed towards attempting to understand the factors involved in the development of a professional identity. In this paper, we present in-depth case studies of two female students to highlight the concept of multiple identities and their formation. Through this deep representation of professional identity, we found that exposure to engineering and overall familiarity with the field proved to be one of the largest factors effecting retention. Our preliminary findings point to the conclusion that recruitment and retention can be improved by increasing the presence of engineering in K-12 settings and …",62
Boundary spanning knowledge broker: An emerging role in global engineering firms,Aditya Johri,2008/10/22,Conference 2008 38th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference,"With the emergence of globalization, engineering firms as well as engineers that work in those firms are faced with new opportunities and challenges. Recent globalization has led to new work roles for engineers. Whether formally or informally, an increasing number of engineers are now playing the role of boundary spanners and are brokering knowledge across geographic boundaries. In this paper I present a case study to identify the requirements and characteristics of this role. The data for this paper comes from two sources: selected interviews with software engineers and an ethnographic study of a global engineering R&D firm. The informants represent the U.S., Japan, and India. The findings show that agency of workers in the midlevel of the organizational hierarchy drives successful global practices. Moreover, given the dynamic nature of work in the present knowledge economy, the requirements of this role …",60
Digital payment and its discontents: Street shops and the Indian government's push for cashless transactions,"Joyojeet Pal, Priyank Chandra, Vaishnav Kameswaran, Aakanksha Parameshwar, Sneha Joshi, Aditya Johri",2018/4/21,Book Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"In November 2016, the Government of India banned the vast majority of the nation's banknotes in a move referred to as 'demonetization', with the stated goals of fighting corruption, terrorism, and eventually expanding digital transactions. In this study of 200 shop-keepers in Mumbai and Bengaluru, we found that cash shortage increased digital payment adoption but that digital payments fell after new banknotes became available. Digital payment adoption depended on the nature and scope of transactions, type of product sold, as well as personal factors specific to business owners such as comfort and familiarity with other digital technologies and online transactions. Using theoretical work on market and information behavior, we examined environmental pushes for technology adoption against prevalent transactional practices, trust, and control. We propose that the move toward digital payments must be framed …",59
Uncovering trajectories of informal learning in large online communities of creators,"Seungwon Yang, Carlotta Domeniconi, Matt Revelle, Mack Sweeney, Ben U Gelman, Chris Beckley, Aditya Johri",2015/3/14,Book Proceedings of the Second (2015) ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale,"We analyzed informal learning in Scratch Online -- an online community with over 4.3 million users and 6.7 million user-generated content. Users develop projects, which are graphical interfaces involving manipulation of programming blocks. We investigated two fundamental questions: how can we model informal learning, and what patterns of informal learning emerge. We proceeded in two phases. First, we modeled learning as a trajectory of cumulative programming block usage by long-term users who created at least 50 projects. Second, we applied K-means++ clustering to uncover patterns of learning and corresponding subpopulations. We found four groups of users manifesting four different patterns of learning, ranging from the smallest to the largest improvement. At one end of the spectrum, users learned more and in a faster manner. At the opposite end, users did not show much learning, even after …",58
Facilitating guided participation through mobile technologies: designing creative learning environments for self and others,"Michael A Evans, Aditya Johri",2008/11,Journal Journal of Computing in Higher Education,"We appropriate Rogoff’s (Apprenticeship in thinking: Cognitive development in social context, 1991; in: Wertsch et al.

Guided participation implies facilitating access to shared community-valued practices by supporting new members in legitimate participation. We illustrate how mobile technologies and social software can be used to (a) facilitate guided participation among undergraduate engineering students within classes and (b) teach graduate students in instructional technology to design for guided participation. Thus, students are not only transitioned into respective learning communities but also gain experience in designing for others. Given the recent advances in computing and …",57
Agency in assistive technology adoption: visual impairment and smartphone use in Bangalore,"Joyojeet Pal, Anandhi Viswanathan, Priyank Chandra, Anisha Nazareth, Vaishnav Kameswaran, Hariharan Subramonyam, Aditya Johri, Mark S Ackerman, Sile O'Modhrain",2017/5/2,Book Proceedings of the 2017 CHI conference on human factors in computing systems,"Studies on technology adoption typically assume that a user's perception of usability and usefulness of technology are central to its adoption. Specifically, in the case of accessibility and assistive technology, research has traditionally focused on the artifact rather than the individual, arguing that individual technologies fail or succeed based on their usability and fit for their users. Using a mixed-methods field study of smartphone adoption by 81 people with visual impairments in Bangalore, India, we argue that these positions are dated in the case of accessibility where a non-homogeneous population must adapt to technologies built for sighted people. We found that many users switch to smartphones despite their awareness of significant usability challenges with smartphones.

Technological barriers and incentives to learning analytics adoption in higher education: Insights from users,"Carrie Klein, Jaime Lester, Huzefa Rangwala, Aditya Johri",2019/12,Journal Journal of Computing in Higher Education,"Learning analytics (LA) tools promise to improve student learning and retention. However, adoption and use of LA tools in higher education is often uneven. In this case study, part of a larger exploratory research project, we interviewed and observed 32 faculty and advisors at a public research university to understand the technological incentives and barriers related to LA tool adoption and use. Findings indicate that lack of a trustworthy technological infrastructure, misalignment between LA tool capabilities and user needs, and the existence of ethical concerns about the data, visualizations, and algorithms that underlie LA tools created barriers to adoption. Improving tool integration, clarity, and accuracy, soliciting the technological needs and perspectives of LA tool users, and providing data context may encourage inclusion of these tools into teaching and advising practice.",52

In this paper we introduce a three-stage framework that automatically generates expertise profiles of online community members. In the first two stages, document-topic relevance and user-document association are estimated for calculating users’ expertise levels on individual topics. We empirically compare two state-of-the-art information retrieval techniques, the vector space model and the language model, with a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based model for computing document-topic relevance as well as the direct and indirect association models for computing user-document association. In the third stage we test whether a filtering strategy can improve the performance of expert profiling. Our experimental results using two real datasets provide …",46

Creating machine readable men: legitimizing the 'Aadhaar' mega e-infrastructure project in India,"Janaki Srinivasan, Aditya Johri",2013/12/7,Book Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development: Full Papers-Volume 1,"Mega infrastructure projects require considerable financial and human resources. Their costs are hard to justify, especially in low-income countries, and their sustenance depends to a large extent on their success in gaining political and public legitimacy. This paper examines one such project in India -- 'Aadhaar' -- developed to provide biometric-based identification for the 1.2 billion residents of India. Since its initiation in 2010, the project has issued more than 320 million identification numbers. Aadhaar is India's first state-sponsored e-infrastructure mega project and is unique for its survival in the face of severe opposition. We argue that the project survived because its proponents were able to legitimize it by showcasing its promise of poverty reduction and financial inclusion, and by making it a metaphor for progress and development.

Forming useful impressions of each other is crucial for coworkers to avoid mistrust, misattribution, and conflict, and thereby, work effectively and productively. In this theoretical review paper I systematically outline how elements of distributed and virtual work – geographic dispersion, electronic dependence, heterogeneity, and dynamic structures – shape coworkers’ impression of each other by influencing information and motivation, the main moderators of impression formation. I develop a model of how the impression formation process acts in technology-mediated distributed work settings, draw propositions, and identify ways to mitigate the breakdown in impression formation among distributed coworkers.

Framework for improving engineering representational literacy by using pen-based computing,"Aditya Johri, Vinod K Lohani",2011/1/1,Journal International Journal of Engineering Education,"Representations such as free-body and circuit diagrams are central to engineering practice and proficiency. Developing and using representations is an essential skill that engineering students need to learn. In this paper we present a case study of the use of pen-based computing to improve representational literacy through dynamic knowledge construction and management activities among engineering students. We use case study data to develop a framework that explains how students can learn to construct and manage knowledge in a participatory learning environment that allows the creation, sharing, recording, and reflection of digital representations. Specifically, we propose that pen-based computing can enable efficient use of representational practices by providing a mechanism to externalize representations through visualization; by supporting awareness and feedback within lectures, and by allowing the co-construction of shared representations among faculty and students. Our framework emphasizes the contextually embedded role of technology in a learning environment and has implications for implementing technology in conjunction with curriculum development to provide meaningful learning experiences.",33

We categorize these triggers into four types: 1) Event-Driven: Alignment of the campaign with offline events related to the issue (Diversity SFO, Disrupt, etc.); 2) Media-Driven: News coverage of the events in the media (TechCrunch, CNN, BBC, etc.); 3) Industry-Driven: Web participation in the campaign by large organizations (Microsoft, Tesla, GE, Cisco, etc.); and 4) Personality-Driven: Alignment of the events with popular and/or known personalities (e.g. Isis Anchalee; Michelle Sun; Ada Lovelace.) This study illustrates how one mechanism - triggering - supports connective action in social media campaign.",30
How players across gender and age experience Pokémon Go?,"Aqdas Malik, Kari Hiekkanen, Zaheer Hussain, Juho Hamari, Aditya Johri",2020/11,Journal Universal Access in the Information Society,"The purpose of this study is to provide insights into player experiences and motivations in Pokémon Go, a relatively new phenomenon of location-based augmented reality games. With the increasing usage and adoption of various forms of digital games worldwide, investigating the motivations for playing games has become crucial not only for researchers but for game developers, designers, and policy makers. Using an online survey (N = 1190), the study explores the motivational, usage, and privacy concerns variations among age and gender groups of Pokémon Go players. Most of the players, who are likely to be casual gamers, are persuaded toward the game due to nostalgic association and word of mouth. Females play Pokémon Go to fulfill physical exploration and enjoyment gratifications. On the other hand, males seek to accomplish social interactivity, achievement, coolness, and nostalgia gratifications …",29

Existing methods frequently make use of edge density and node attributes; however, the methods ultimately have different definitions of community and build strong assumptions about community features into their models. We propose a new method for community detection, which estimates both per-community feature distributions (topics) and per-node community membership. Communities are modeled as connected subgraphs with nodes sharing similar attributes. Nodes may join multiple communities and share common attributes with each. Communities have an associated probability distribution over attributes and node attributes are modeled as draws from a mixture distribution. We make two basic assumptions about community structure: communities are densely connected and have a small network diameter …",27

Acting the Same Differently: A Cross-Course Comparison of User Behavior in MOOCs.,"Ben Gelman, Matt Revelle, Carlotta Domeniconi, Aditya Johri, Kalyan Veeramachaneni",2016,Journal International Educational Data Mining Society,"Recent studies of MOOCs demonstrate their ability to reach a large number of users, but also caution against the high rate of dropout. Some have looked closely at MOOC participation in order to better understand how and when users start to disengage, and, if they remain engaged, in what activities they participate. Most of this prior work relies heavily on descriptive statistics or clustering methodologies to highlight basic user participation characteristics. In this paper, we adapt NMF to provide a multi-dimensional view of user participation. We use log data to create a bottom-up understanding of user participation, and identify five basic behaviors associated with participants' use of content and their engagement with assessment. Furthermore, we do a cross-course analysis across four courses and find that these five behaviors are present in all courses. Interestingly, users' participation patterns - how they engage in these five behaviors - vary across courses even when the",23

Prior work on newcomers has addressed socialization processes but has overlooked the sociomaterial nature of engineering practices and its consequences for newcomer participation. In this paper, I present an in-depth case study of a newcomer navigating his early days in an industrial research and development laboratory. I identify ‘demoing’, or the use of prototypes to communicate research outcomes, as a highly valued practice at the studied firm and trace a newcomer's participation from entry until his first demo, which signaled significant progress toward full participation.

In this paper, we present findings from a study of retention and migration among STEM students, comparing rates across both engineering and science students. We look at all students admitted between 2009-2014, both direct admits and transfer, at a large public university. Transfer students are often neglected in studies of retention and persistence especially in engineering. We found that engineering students are more persistent than science students with retention rates over 60% for engineering students compared to 40% in math. Persistence rates for first-time students are less than transfer students in the engineering enrollments. Also, as in previous studies, most migration out of discipline occurs in the first two years of enrollment. We also found that among enrolled students, a large number of engineering students (almost 20%) have not declared a major some until later in their studies.",21

In fall 2006 Tablet based in and out of class activities were implemented in the freshman engineering program. In fall 2007, Tablet based instruction activities were implemented in upper level engineering courses. Typical examples of Tablet based instruction included electronic note taking, use of inking features to review homework solutions, completing skeleton PowerPoint slides, and setting up online collaboration sessions to do group design project and problem solving activities. In addition, the Tablets helped students maintain an electronic log of their individual and group efforts in completing design projects. A major change in 2007 was the incorporation of DyKnow software into instruction. Examples of students’ feedback in support of feedback based instruction and assessment data from in-class polling and an end of semester course exit survey of freshmen are presented to discuss the effectiveness of Tablet based instruction.

Creative collaboration: A case study of the role of computers in supporting representational and relational interaction in student engineering design teams,"Aditya Johri, Christopher Williams, James Pembridge",2013/1/1,Journal International Journal of Engineering Education,"In this paper, the authors present a framework for examining the role of computers in supporting creative collaborative engineering design. It is argued that the affordance of computational technology for supporting both representational and relational aspects of design is essential for creative collaboration. Representational aspects refer to the creation of verbal descriptions or visual sketches necessary for the generation and sharing of ideas. Relational aspects refer to support for communicative and collaborative aspects that are the cornerstones of teamwork. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework, the authors present empirical findings from a case study of a collaborative engineering design project. In this study, a team of engineering design students successfully appropriate available technologies to create collaborative practices. The design practices of this team are compared with another team working on the same project but that met face-to-face. Through this comparison it is shown that computation technology can be used creatively by design teams.",14

We examine a MySQL newcomer forum before and after two takeover announcements -- the January 2008 announcement of MySQL's takeover by Sun Microsystems, and the April 2009 announcement of Sun's takeover by Oracle. We find that the impact on participation depends on how the acquiring company is perceived. The announcement of an acquisition by a company perceived as hostile had a negative effect on participation, whereas announcement of acquisition by a more friendly company was found to have no effect on participation. These changes in participation occurred without any accompanying change in the product itself, or its licensing.

Artificial intelligence and engineering education,Aditya Johri,2020/7,Source Journal of Engineering Education,"I was recently invited to give a research seminar at an academic institution and so I did what most academics do in such cases: I made a PowerPoint (PPT) presentation. I had recently updated the PPT software on my computer, and as I worked my way through the design of the slide deck, I started to receive automatically generated design suggestions for my slides. These suggestions were different from the standard template slides already available in PPT; they were dynamic and based on the elements I had already placed on the slides. The program took my text and images and moved them around, put them in boxes, drew an outline around them, and, in some cases, added fancy borders. Not all “design ideas,” as the software calls them, were good or even useful. The software also made what I thought were some egregious errors. For instance, it would “un-crop” an image I had cropped. Yet, over time, I found myself making increased use of the suggestions, and as I did so, the range of suggestions I received changed. I got a wider variety of suggestions. This whole process would have gone unnoticed except that in this instance I was preparing a talk on the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on engineering education. In the context of that topic, it was hard for me to ignore a real-life example of AI in action. My work practice was being shaped by AI. From a technical perspective, this is an unremarkable example.

Through a study of workers from two organizations working on FLOSS projects we identify the boundaries, in terms of productivity and quality of life, of virtual work and actions workers take in order to find a work-life balance. We found that although workers valued the flexibility of working from home, they had difficulty focusing on their work for sustained time periods and often felt isolated. This motivated them to use coworking spaces - physical spaces used as work space by workers not on the same team or even the same firm - as a critical part of their space ecology. In conjunction with their media ecology - a mix of communication technologies including IRC - the space/media mix allowed them to balance their work and personal lives.

Open organizing refers to development of socio-technical infrastructure that allows people to successfully contribute to an endeavor irrespective of their physical location. Through a grounded theory analysis of field study data collected from an organization I call Digitech, I outline characteristics of open organizing practices and discuss their benefits for the engineers who worked there and for the organization. Overall, the findings reveal that successful creation and implementation of open organizing can result in better work-life balance for engineers and increase productivity and innovation.",11

The goal of this research is to identify factors related to course-taking choices and degree planning that can affect students’ academic performance. The data for the study was collected from three majors within an engineering school at a large public university: civil, environmental, and infrastructure engineering (CEIE), computer science (CS), and information technology (INFT). The data includes more than 13,500 records of 360 students. Analysis shows that low performers postponed some courses until the latter end of their program, which delayed consequence courses and their graduation. We also found that low performers enrolled in multiple courses together at the same semester that their counterparts do not usually take concurrently.

Representational literacy and participatory learning in large engineering classes using pen-based computing,"Aditya Johri, Vinod Lohani",2008/10/22,Conference 2008 38th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference,"Representations are central to engineering practice. In this paper we present a theoretical model of how technology enables learning through participation by facilitating creation, sharing, recording, and reflection of representations. Our study is focused on large lecture classes (150-300 students) of a freshman year engineering course Engineering Exploration. Large classes provide unique challenges to the use of representations as the use of gestures and facial expressions in communication is hindered due to the size of classes. We found that when used concurrently Tablets and DyKnow supported representational practice facilitating student expression and increasing engagement in lectures. The technology further supported awareness and feedback within lectures and allowed co-construction of shared representations among faculty and students leading to a feedback based learning environment.

ICT4D and the learning sciences,"Michael A Evans, Aditya Johri, George E Glasson, Kursat Cagiltay, Joyojeet Pal, Piya Sorcar",2008,"Publisher International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.","Over the last two decades, the learning sciences have contributed immensely to curricula-based learning in formal environments. Recently, there is an increased emphasis on learning that occurs outside formal institutions, especially through the use of technology. Design experiments and design-based research have resulted in several innovations and in an overall conception of designing and researching new learning environments. Not surprisingly, technology has been a critical component of research and teaching. Yet, this focus has primarily been on developed nations in the West. Recently the participation from other areas of the world, especially Africa, Asia, the Middle East, has been on the increase while the community of researchers and scholars is internationalizing. One area of innovation that has not been part of the community but which we wish to bring to focus through our symposium is the use of information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) in emerging economies.",10
Lifelong and lifewide learning for the perpetual development of expertise in engineering,Aditya Johri,2022/1/2,Journal European Journal of Engineering Education,"Increasing digitisation of engineering and social practices has altered the relationship between formal schooling and development of expertise for professional engineering work. What does the development of expertise look like when knowledge is generated and shared at an accelerated pace due to shifts in technology? In this paper, I present case studies of two early career software engineers. Using methodological insights from digital ethnography, I trace their professional journeys over two decades. I empirically demonstrate how the development of engineering expertise is a continuous and perpetual endeavour and engineers learn throughout their lives (lifelong) and across all the different spaces they inhabit at any given time (lifewide). I argue for extending engineering work practices research and research in engineering education more broadly to take larger timescales of learning into account to build a …",9

How social media supports hashtag activism through multivocality: A case study of# ILookLikeanEngineer,"Aqdas Malik, Aditya Johri, Rajat Handa, Habib Karbasian, Hemant Purohit",2018/11/1,Journal First Monday,"Although research on different hashtag activism campaigns abounds, no study has looked at how different affordances of social media support a single campaign. We use data from a hashtag activism campaign,# ILookLikeAnEngineer, launched to showcase diversity within engineering workforce, to examine how different elements of a campaign blend together. We specifically identify three distinct but interconnected ways in which social media supports activism: 1) modality—it allows users to participate through text, photos, and links; 2) messaging—it allows users to post and support multiple though related topics; and 3) actors—it provides a voice to different participants (individuals/organizations, men/women). Our analysis supports the idea that multivocality—the core idea that people leverage multiple ways of participating—is the key to campaign success. Our analysis of 19,492 original tweets and 89,650 retweets shows that multivocality allowed the campaign to receive support not just from individuals but from large corporations, media, and NGOs, who were able to share their perspective using their preferred modality giving rise to a new form of digital polyphonic narrative that supports their agenda.",9

Engineering competitions as pathways to development of professional engineering skills,"Lori C Bland, Stephanie Marie Kusano, Aditya Johri",2016/6/26,Conference 2016 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"In this paper we present preliminary findings from a research project aimed at identifying learning outcomes in informal environments. For our study we focus specifically on engineering competitions which have gained momentum across a range of engineering disciplines. Increasingly, students are participating in design competitions that range anywhere from multi-year activities such as Concrete Canoe, Formula SAE to short term activities such as one day competitions on Hack-a-thons. Although competitions are becoming popular, there is little research on what students learn through their participation in these events. Proponents of competitions argue that these activities provide students the opportunity to apply both technical and professional skills and knowledge to a practical or applied problem and through their participation improve their skills or knowledge, ie learn. To empirically examine this issue we conducted a qualitative study across competitions and then developed a survey to measure learning outcomes. We examined students’ experiences of developing professional skills as defined by ABET. Findings indicate that professional responsibilities were discussed most often. Students discussed cognitions, behaviors, and dispositions in three broad categories: self-management, task management, and team management. By providing students the opportunity to own the problem and its outcomes, engineering competitions can empower students to think like, act as, and be professional engineers.",8

AI for trustworthiness! Credible user identification on social web for disaster response agencies,"Rahul Pandey, Hemant Purohit, Jennifer Chan, Aditya Johri",2018/10/1,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.01013,"Although social media provides a vibrant platform to discuss real-world events, the quantity of information generated can overwhelm decision making based on that information. By better understanding who is participating in information sharing, we can more effectively filter information as the event unfolds. Fine-grained understanding of credible sources can even help develop a trusted network of users for specific events or situations. Given the culture of relying on trusted actors for work practices in the humanitarian and disaster response domain, we propose to identify potential credible users as organizational and organizational-affiliated user accounts on social media in realtime for effective information collection and dissemination. Therefore, we examine social media using AI and Machine Learning methods during three types of humanitarian or disaster events and identify key actors responding to social media conversations as organization (business, group, or institution), organization-affiliated (individual with an organizational affiliation), and non-affiliated (individual without organizational affiliation) identities. We propose a credible user classification approach using a diverse set of social, activity, and descriptive representation features extracted from user profile metadata. Our extensive experiments showed a contrasting participation behavior of the user identities by their content practices, such as the use of higher authoritative content sharing by organization and organization-affiliated users. This study provides a direction for designing realtime credible content analytics systems for humanitarian and disaster response agencies.",6

Concept maps are effective interventions in providing students with a holisticunderstanding of a domain while also allowing understanding of relationships among parts andacross the engineering curricula. Yet when the domain of application is large, concept mapsbecome overburdened with too much information and complexity. A function of the individuallearners’ cognitive load abilities, this phenomenon (termed “map shock”) results in studentdisengagement and reduction of expected learning gains. This limitation prevents the creation ofconcept maps that provide a unified framework for engineering knowledge across courses andcurricula. Thus, existing approaches to implementing expert-generated concept maps as contentrepositories are limited by:(i) an inability to effectively convey a large quantity of informationand (ii) an inability to adapt the presentation of information for each learner’s individualcognitive needs. To address these limitations, we apply theoretical research on adaptive expertise, conceptmaps, and information visualization to design, develop and assess a cyberlearning tool thatadvances personalized learning and helps students develop deep and broad conceptualknowledge. The proposed visualization tool, the “adaptive concept map,” overcomes theproblem of map shock by providing the user control over the quantity and level of …",6

Creating a participatory learning environment in large lecture classes using pen-based computing,"Aditya Johri, Vinod Lohani",2008,"Publisher International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.","Although large lectures are a reality of formal learning organizations, particularly in nation's research universities, limited research looks at how we can improve learning within them. Most learning sciences research focuses on small or medium classes or informal learning leaving a gap in our understanding of learning related issues in large lectures. In this paper we present a theoretical investigation of the use of pen-based computing in large lectures (>150 students). In particular, through this case study we examined how the combined use of Tablet PCs and the interactive software DyKnow creates a learning environment that is conducive to student participation and learning. We argue that these technologies enable participation by facilitating creation, sharing, recording, and reflecting of representations. Although the ideas presented in this paper are primarily theoretical, we do find supporting evidence through in-class (N=100 to 250) and online surveys (N = 525) of engineering freshmen at Virginia Tech.",6
Using the Boeing Max Air Disaster as a role-play scenario for teaching ethical thinking,"Ashish Hingle, Aditya Johri, Huzefa Rangwala, Alexander Monea",2021/7/26,Conference 2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access,"Algorithms are a central component of most services we use across a range of domains. These services, platforms, and devices rely on computing and technology professionals–who work as data scientists, programmers, or artificial intelligence (AI) experts–to meet their intended goals. How do we train future professionals to have an ethical mindset in their understanding, design, and implementation of algorithms? This was the question that prompted the use of a role-playing case study, which we designed, implemented, and studied in an undergraduate engineering course. We used the Boeing Max 8 flight disaster as the scenario for this case study as it encapsulates how a software algorithm shapes decision-making in a complex scenario. Theoretically, our work is guided by the situated learning paradigm, specifically the need to learn perspectival thinking for decision-making. The ability to make ethical decisions relies to a large extent on the ability of the decision-maker to take context into account–to understand not just the immediate technical need of the work but also larger implications that might even result from unanticipated consequences. Findings from the evaluation of the role-play scenario show that students reported a higher engagement with case study material and a better understanding of the scenario due to taking on a specific role related to the scenario. Analysis of pre-and post-discussion assignments shows a shift in their perspective of the case, further supporting the overall goal of developing a more situated understanding of ethical decision-making.",5
Ethics is a disempowered subject in the engineering curriculum,"Diana Adela Martin, Gunter Bombaerts, Aditya Johri",2021,"Conference 49th SEFI Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening-and Lasting?","Power, as enacted in educational practices, is a critical issue that shapes all aspects of engineering education. Yet, there is little research within engineering education on how power manifests itself in what we teach and how we teach it. In this paper we use engineering ethics education as an exemplar to interrogate how power tacitly influences the practice of engineering ethics education. To infer the status of engineering ethics as an academic subject we examine, theorize, and elaborate on two aspects of power:(1) the internal power relations affecting the education of engineering ethics and how they manifest within engineering institutions, and (2) the exerting power of key external actors in and ways in which they impact engineering ethics education. Our methodological approach relies on autoethnographic data rooted in the perspective of the three authors. The autoethnographic cases are grounded in the authors’ own teaching and research practices in engineering ethics education set in the US, Irish and Dutch context. We perform a cross-comparative analysis to reflect further on the impact of power relations on ethics as an academic subject and make recommendations for engineering ethics education research and practice.",5
Curating tweets: A framework for using Twitter for workplace learning,"H Le, Aditya Johri, Aqdas Malik",2019/1,Journal ASEE Annual Conference proceedings,"Cybersecurity is a rapidly evolving field where professionals constantly need to keep up with new technologies and retrain. In this paper, we present a study that analyzed social media data and use the findings to aid professionals and students to learn more effectively using Twitter. We analyzed 23,000 cybersecurity related tweets posted on Twitter across two hashtags# cybersecurity and# infosec. Our analysis created a framework that explains how using descriptive, content, and network analysis can generate information that can help professionals learn. In addition, our analysis provided insights on the tweets and the cybersecurity community that use them. These insights include: Most tweets covered multiple topics and used three or more hashtags. Companies and other organizations had the highest numbers of followers, but individual users, experts in the field, were the most retweeted. Popular users, based on follower counts, were not necessarily the most influential (based on retweets). In terms of content, popular tweets consisted of infographics that packed a lot of information. Tweets were commonly used to announce file dumps of hacks and data leaks. Many highly used hashtags represented current threats and the overall sentiment of cybersecurity tweets are negative. Highly connected users on Twitter served as hubs across the three primary sub communities identified in the data. Insights from his study can assist with improving workforce development by guiding professionals in getting pertinent information and keeping up to date with the latest security threats and news.",5
Situated Information Seeking for Learning: A Case Study of Engineering Workplace Cognition among Cybersecurity Professionals,"Hieu-Trung Le, Aditya Johri, Aqdas Malik",2018/6/23,Conference 2018 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"Workforce development in engineering is a high priority to keep pace with innovation and change within engineering disciplines and also within organizations. Increasingly, workforce development requires more retraining and retooling of employees than ever before as information technology has accelerated both the creation of a new body of knowledge and also the skills required to perform the work. In this paper we present a field study of a highly dynamic workplace–a cybersecurity firm–undertaken to better understand how engineers keep up with the pace of knowledge that is needed for their work. Fifteen professionals, with a wide range of experience and educational background, were interviewed. Data were analyzed iteratively and interpretively. The findings from the study suggest that over time some well-defined ways of learning had developed in the workplace we studied. These learning practices combined in-person and online interactions and resources. We also found that learning was triggered largely by the need to solve a problem or by the interests of the engineers to learn more in order to be prepared for new knowledge in the field. Depending on the problem they faced, the engineers mapped the requirements of what was needed to solve the problem, identified the resources that were available, and then selected the optimal resource. Often, as is common with problem solving, our participants had to try out multiple options. Theoretically, our study contributes by integrating an information seeking perspective with situated cognition to inform future studies of learning in information rich engineering and technology workplaces.",5
# ILookLikeAnEngineer: Using Social Media-Based Hashtag Activism Campaigns as a Lens to Better Understand Engineering Diversity Issues,"Aditya Johri, Habib Karbasian, Aqdas Malik, Rajat Handa, Hemant Purohit",2018/4/29,Conference 2018 CoNECD-The Collaborative Network for Engineering and Computing Diversity Conference,"Each year, significant investment of time and resources is made to improve diversity within engineering across a range of federal and state agencies, private/not-for-profit organizations, and foundations. In spite of decades of investments, efforts have not yielded desired returns-participation by minorities continues to lag at a time when STEM workforce requirements are increasing. In recent years a new stream of data has emerged-online social networks, including Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn-that acts as a key sensor of social behavior and attitudes among the US population. Almost 87% of the American population now participates in some form of social media activity. Consequently, social networking sites have become powerful indicators of social action and social media data has shown significant promise for studying many issues including public health communication, political climate, humanitarian crisis, and, social movements. We argue that social media data can likewise be leveraged to better understand and improve engineering diversity. As a case study to illustrate the viability of the approach, we present findings from a campaign,# ILookLikeandEngineer, aimed at increasing gender diversity in the engineering workplace.

Showing and telling: response dynamics in an online community of makers,"Omaima Almatrafi, Aditya Johri",2017,"Publisher Philadelphia, PA: International Society of the Learning Sciences.","Online communities are an important learning resource across domains. For learners in Makers, Making, and 3D printing online communities are vital as most knowledge sharing and problem-solving occurs online. In this study, we examine one online Maker community called SoliForum to better understand how an emphasis on producing physical objects shapes online interaction. Specifically, we investigate what kinds of messages elicit useful responses for those seeking help. We found that, compared to posts that contained only text, posts that contained media elements such as images and videos had a higher response rate and more resolved problems. Based on our analysis we attribute this to the more descriptive and explanatory power of multimedia elements and their ability to represent physical objects. The findings suggest that guidance for crafting messages using multimedia can lead to more equitable participation and learning in online Maker communities.",5

Experts Learn More (than Newcomers): An Exploratory Study of Argumentation in an Online Help Forum,"Hon Jie Teo, Aditya Johri",2013,Publisher International Society of the Learning Sciences,"Online help forums have emerged as a powerful form of knowledge sharing with significant implications for CSCL. To understand knowledge construction and learning within online help forums, this study examined the interactional dynamics amongst help-givers (experts) and help-seekers (newcomers) in an open, voluntary help forum for Java computer programming language. A purposive sample of active threads was analyzed using a coding scheme adapted from the argumentative knowledge construction (AKC) framework. The study found that while help-givers actively engaged in advanced argumentative and social moves, help-seekers seldom did. Furthermore, the number of advanced epistemic messages was lower than expected and both help-givers and help-seekers often veered off-topic towards socialization and conflict-oriented interactions. The study questions the feasibility of online help forums for facilitating acquisition of domain-specific knowledge by help-seekers but demonstrates the viability of the platform as a mechanism for experts to expand their knowledge. Our findings suggest that those who know more are able to learn more given their ability to engage in argumentation.",5

Work in progress-reorganizing engineering pedagogy: Preventing student disengagement by increasing dialogic learning,Aditya Johri,2009/10/18,Conference 2009 39th IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference,In this work in progress paper the author presents preliminary evidence from ongoing research that suggests that the organization of current pedagogy in short class sessions leaves prevents students from engaging in a dialogue and is partly responsible for student disengagement from engineering. The author draws on theoretical literature on dialogic inquiry and preliminary data from analysis of two different classes to show that engineering classes are often characterized by lack of joint meaning making and knowledge construction at the expense of information delivery. The author argues that our current use of technology often exacerbates and compounds the problem and prevents conceptual learning. The author suggests that a potential solution is to revise our understanding of the role of dialogue and the use of technology and design for dialogic inquiry so that language - verbal and written - and …,5
Bridging artifacts and actors: supporting knowledge and expertise sharing work practices through technology,"Aditya Johri, Volkmar Pipek, Volker Wulf, Michael Veith",2007/3/30,Book Proceedings of the 2007 symposium on Computer human interaction for the management of information technology,In this paper we present findings from longitudinal case studies examining work practices in three different organizations. We propose that knowledge and expertise sharing (KES) within organizations can be supported by focusing on two mutually intertwined elements -- artifacts and actors -- and their interaction within a particular setting. We find that a closer examination of work practices helps in developing better support as the new design meshes well with technology already available within the organization. In this paper we discuss our research and design methodology and present specific technological modifications we introduced in organizational work practices.,5

Interpersonal assessment: Evaluating others in online learning environments,Aditya Johri,2006,"Book Self, Peer and Group Assessment in E-Learning","This chapter introduces and discusses the concept of interpersonal assessment. Interpersonal assessment refers to the act of assessing what other participantsin an online learning environment know and how they behave. Interpersonalassessment is critical for successful learning outcomes, especially incollaborative groups, since students need to know what others in a groupknow and how they act to be able to work them. Moreover, knowledge aboutparticipants has implications for self, peer, and group assessment. Althoughinterpersonal assessment is important for both online and traditionallearning environments, it is often more difficult to assess others in onlinelearning environments due to the lack of face-to-face interaction, mediatedcues, and unshared contexts.

Engineering time: Learning analytics initiative to understand how first-year engineering students spend their time,"Cory Brozina, Aditya Johri, Nazanin Naderi",2019/6/15,Conference 2019 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"This Complete Research paper describes a learning analytics (LA) informed initiative to collect a detailed account of how first-year engineering students spend their time. With a plethora of calls to increase the number of engineering graduates, it is imperative to set students up for success during their first year. While there are multiple strategies infused in students’ first year of college, and as many focused towards engineering students, there are still gaps in our understanding of what students do with their time outside of the classroom. This paper presents a study that uses a learning analytics initiative to uncover what students are doing outside the classroom and how they spend their time. Specifically, this study addresses one research question: How do first-year engineering students manage their time? Time management is one of the most critical aspects of a student’s success in college. Analyzing time management practices of students can provide valuable information about how they work and what helps them succeed. Our research details a pilot study of 14 first-year engineering students across two weeks during the Fall semester of 2017. Students used a shared Google Sheet to keep track of their activities in half-hour increments using a template created by the research team. The template includes six categories for students to fill-in: date, time, location, activity, course, and notes. Results of the study highlight the daily habits of first-year engineering students with sleep (36.94%), leisure (19.22%), other (11.04%), studying short-and long-term (8.93%), and class (7.89%) as the top four categories where students spend their time.",3
Absorptive capacity and routines: Understanding barriers to learning analytics adoption in higher education,Aditya Johri,2018/8/6,Book Learning Analytics in Higher Education,"As I sit here writing this near the start of a new semester, it is hard to imagine that it is almost a decade since the term ‘Big Data’, in its current incarnation,“the mining and processing of petabytes’ worth of information to gain insights into customer behavior, supply chain efficiency and many other aspects of business performance”(Pearson & Wegener, 2013, p. 1), was first introduced in the mainstream media by The Economist (2010). Since then, the notion of data analytics has infused almost all thinking about how organizations go about their business; and data-driven organizations and organizations driving data-driven practices, including infrastructures such as cloud computing, have become the jewels of the business world (eg, Amazon™, Google™, etc.). It was reported in a recent study of more than 400 large companies conducted by Bain & Company that early adopters of Big Data analytics had a significant lead over the rest of the corporate world (Pearson & Wegener, 2013). The companies that had adopted Big Data analytics, according to this report, were (1) twice as likely to be in the top quartile of financial performance within their industries,(2) five times as likely to make decisions faster than market peers,(3) three times as likely to execute decisions as intended, and (4) twice as likely to use data frequently when making decisions (Pearson & Wegener, 2013).

The development of engineering students' metacognitive skills in informal engineering learning activities,"Xingya Xu, Lori C Bland, Stephanie Marie Kusano, Aditya Johri",2017/6/24,Conference 2017 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"The ability to analyze and evaluate one’s own thinking and acquisition of knowledge and skills, or metacognition, is an important set of skills for engineering students to acquire. Metacognition is simply defined as “thinking about thinking” or “cognition about cognition”[8]. It is awareness of one’s learning processes and regulation of one’s learning behaviors [8]. In this paper, we will address two types of metacognitive skills: metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive regulation. Flavell [8] described metacognitive knowledge as an individual’s knowledge about their own cognitive processes; metacognitive regulation is a process in which individuals monitor, regulate and evaluate cognitive activities to attain particular cognitive goals [25]. Metacognitive skills are related to learning. Students who understand how to apply metacognition to their learning had a better understanding of learning and were more successful [1, 9, 17]. Specifically, students’ self-awareness of their learning processes facilitated learning and performance [2]. In addition, students’ application of metacognitive skills in practice supported students’ learning within different contexts and improved their adaptive capabilities within those contexts [23]. Because adaptive capabilities are critical within the engineering workplace, it is important that engineering students learn metacognitive skills necessary to develop adaptive capabilities. The purpose for this work is to examine students’ statements about their experiences within engineering competitions and a service-based learning project identifying their metacognitive reflections about their participation in these informal learning …",3

This paper describes a novel way of educating non-computer scientists (eg students, K-12, senators, elderly, etc.) the concept of parallelcomputational thinking. Parallel computational thinking involves the basic understanding of theconcept of parallel computing, where multiple computing resources are simultaneously used tosolve a computational problem. Without parallel computational thinking most modern scientificdiscoveries are impracticable (eg sequencing the human genome, confirmation of the Higgsboson). However educating novice learners of the importance and sophistication of parallelsystems that grow exponentially large and change rapidly has been a challenging task. Inparticular, parallel computing devices have been inherently designed as a “black box” in whichthe only indication of transmission is through limited external cues (ie flashing LED lights orthe hum of the system). In order to visualize and better understand the data transmission mechanism and algorithmicpatters of parallel computing, a kinetic computing sculpture comprising of a functional cluster ofRaspberry Pi computers has been built by an interdisciplinary group of researchers.

Effect of external events on newcomer participation in open source online communities,"Raktim Mitra, Aditya Johri, Oded Nov",2013/5/31,Journal First Monday,"Newcomer participation is a strong determinant of the success of online communities, particularly of open source software (OSS) development communities. Most research on newcomer participation in online communities so far has been limited to understanding the socialization experiences of participants once they join a community. No study we are aware of has looked at the role of factors external to a community itself in determining participation levels. We argue that it is important to understand external factors to delineate accurate reasons for decline or growth of participation in a community. In this study, we investigate the effect of company announcements made by OSS steward firms, events which are external to a community, on participation in newcomer communities associated with the OSS. We studied activity in two communities, a Java newcomer forum and a MySQL newcomer forum, around two announcements that affected each community. We found evidence that company announcements had a substantial effect and participation either increased or decreased. Through analysis of secondary sources we conjecture that announcements indirect shape participation by influencing newcomer motivation. Announcements perceived as hostile to open source values have a significant negative effect on participation, whereas announcements perceived as friendly either significantly increase participation or have no significant effect.",3
Augmented sociomateriality: implications of artificial intelligence for the field of learning technology,Aditya Johri,2022/5/19,Journal Research in Learning Technology,"There has been a conscious effort in the past decade to produce a more theoretical account of the use of technology for learning. At the same time, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are being rapidly incorporated into learning technologies, significantly changing their affordances for teaching and learning. In this article I address the question of whether introduction of AI and associated features such as machine learning is a novel development from a theoretical perspective, and if so, how? I draw on the existing perspective of sociomateriality for learning and argue that the use of AI is indeed different because AI transforms sociomateriality by allowing materiality to take on characteristics previously associated primarily with a human agent, thereby shifting the nature of the sociomaterial assemblage. In this data and algorithm-driven AI-based sociomateriality, affordances for representation and agency change, thereby modifying representational and relational practices that are essential for cognition. The dualities of data/algorithm, representational/agentic augmentation, and relational/participatory practices act in tandem within this new sociomaterial assemblage. If left unchecked, this new assemblage is prone to perpetuate the biases programmed within the technology itself. Therefore, it is important to take ethical and moral implications of using AI-driven learning technologies into account before their use.",2

These efforts draw the young and the diverse into seeing engineering as a worthwhile profession. One such effort at the national level in the U.S. is the “National Engineers Week”. This is a week-long celebration held every February that consists of numerous events and activities organized for the general public with a focus towards students, women, and under-represented groups. In this paper, we examined this effort through the lens of social media and analyzed Twitter data collected for two hashtags used during the National Engineers Week 2017: “#eweek2017” and “#engineersweek”. Our dataset consisted of 6,583 original tweets and 10,885 retweets. To study the impact of the outreach we used three analytical approaches: descriptive analysis, content analysis, and network analysis. We found that the Twitter campaign participation was dominated by engineering companies and individual users followed by a limited participation of educational institutions, professional engineering associations, and non-profits. As opposed to other popular hashtag campaigns, not a single news media organization was identified as a participating user signaling a lower new media-driven propagation of the campaign among the public. From a content perspective, the tweets can be categorized as event promotion, showcasing employees of engineering companies, or encouraging and inspiring public (especially women and children) towards engineering.

Unlike traditional situated learning settings where learners were embedded in the same site for extensive periods of time, current learning environments supports a lighter vein of cognitive apprenticeship as learners switch participation frequently and rely extensively on external sources. A situated cognition genre perspective also provides a mechanism to trace learners’ trajectory across sites–both online and offline–and participate in different cognitive episodes. As an empirical case study, I examine an online forum related to 3D printing/Making called Soliforum. Consistent with research on situated learning, findings illustrate that digital materiality provides ample support for informal learning through affordances for displaying social characteristics, allowing use of different forms of informational resources, and providing support for problem solving activities among participants. The genre perspective facilitates additional examination of cognitive affordances of the online community by examining what constitutes the different cognitive episodes–asynchronous interaction; use of text, visuals, and videos; feedback from multiple experts; and the ability to learn from worked out examples. I argue that “situated cognition genres” is an important …",2
Evidence of Temporal Artifacts in Social Networks.,"Matt Revelle, Carlotta Domeniconi, Aditya Johri",2015/9/7,Conference MUSE@ PKDD/ECML,"There has been extensive research on social networks and methods for specific tasks such as: community detection, link prediction, and tracing information cascades; and a recent emphasis on using temporal dynamics of social networks to improve method performance. The underlying models are based on structural properties of the network, some of which we believe to be artifacts introduced from common misrepresentations of social networks. Specifically, representing a social network or series of social networks as an accumulation of network snapshots is problematic. In this paper, we use a dataset with timestamped interactions to demonstrate how cumulative graphs differ from activity-based graphs and may introduce temporal artifacts.",2
Promoting Conceptual Understanding in Engineering Statics Through the Use of Adaptive Concept Maps,"Jacob P Moore, Christopher B Williams, Chris North, Aditya Johri",2013/6/23,Conference 2013 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"PROMOTING CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING IN ENGINEERING STATICS THROUGH THE USE OF ADAPTIVE CONCEPT MAPS This paper discusses the continuing work on a two year NSF funded project to explore thefeasibility and effectiveness of a scalable concept map based navigation system for a digitaltextbook. This tool, termed the Adaptive Map, is designed to promote the conceptualunderstanding in students by using a concept map of an expert’s knowledge as an advanceorganizer. Because large concept maps become visually cluttered and are therefore less effectiveas learning tools, information visualization techniques have to be used to manage the cognitiveload imposed on the learner. The prototype tool contains content that would be similar to thematerial in a traditional statics textbook, but the information is accessed through this conceptmap based visualization tool that is the focus of the proposed project. The adaptive map tooloptimizes the concept map visual for the current content based on the user’s current focus, givingthem a context for detailed content information. Researchers are evaluating the tool’s effect on conceptual understanding and cognitive loadusing a quasi-experimental setup, comparing two similar classes where one section has beengiven access to the tool (experimental section) and one section has not been given access to thetool (control group).

Designing development: Case study of an international education and outreach program,"Aditya Johri, Akshay Sharma",2013/1/25,Journal Synthesis Lectures on Global Engineering,"The creation of physical and material infrastructure is the cornerstone of human development; not surprisingly, engineers and designers are often motivated and inspired in their practice to improve the world around them, to make things better for others, and to apply their knowledge for the good of mankind. These aspirations often get translated into engineering and design curricula where students and faculty work on development related projects usually under the category of community or service learning. This book presents an overview of such an education and outreach program designed to empower stakeholders to improve their lives. The project described here was an international multi-institutional undertaking that included academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and private firms.

Understanding impression formation among distributed coworkers,Aditya Johri,2007,Publisher ProQuest,"Understanding our fellow beings is one of the most fundamental and essential behaviors in which we humans engage and in order to be successful in this endeavor we need to form impressions of others. Previous work suggests that impression formation is a complex interpersonal process that occurs primarily at the dyadic level and is fraught with complications, often leading to misinformed, misinterpreted, and stereotypic impressions. In this study I present a multi-level explanation of impression formation and argue that impression formation is dually-shaped: by institutional frames deriving from the level of the field as well as the organization, and by the micro-level interactions among coworkers that occur in organizational social situations. To examine impression formation, I conducted a qualitative field study of a research and development lab, TechLab, which has offices in the US and Asia and does work in area of information technology and software systems. Extensive data were collected over five months using interviews, observations, surveys, and archival analysis. The finding shows that TechLab researchers formed impressions using dual lenses of situational and institutional frames. The actions they observed were interpreted based on the particular settings and situation such as staff or group meeting (what is going on here), and the significance of those actions within the larger institutional context such as the reputation of the lab (what does this mean/how does this matter). The data also show that distributed organization of labor involves a confluence of institutional and organizational challenges mixed with lack of situational …",2
"Learning to Link Micro, Meso, and Macro Ethical Concerns Through Role-Play Discussions","Aditya Johri, Ashish Hingle",2022/10/8,Conference 2022 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"In this Research-to-Practice paper, we present findings from a study of role-play discussions for teaching technology ethics. In recent years there has been an increased emphasis on preparing students who are not only aware of microlevel aspects of ethics but are cognizant of broader ethical obligations at organizational and societal levels. In order to prepare engineers who can contribute towards addressing the grand challenges facing the world, such as sustainability, poverty, and social justice, among others, this approach is necessary. Students have to develop the ability to look beyond a narrow problem or issue, e.g., ethical design choice related to the use of a certain chemical compound and harms to users, to the larger environmental implications of this choice. Ethics is taught in a variety of ways in engineering, including diverse pedagogical approaches and topics, but one core technique is the use of case …",1
Instructing First-Year Engineering Students on the Ethics of Algorithms through a Role-Play,"Ashish Hingle, Aditya Johri, Cory Brozina",2022/8/23,Conference 2022 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"Introductory engineering courses teach a range of foundational topics to first-year engineering students. An ethics component is often presented as one of these broad topics, usually through a case study module that examines past catastrophic engineering events. In this Research-to-Practice paper, we present findings from a study using role-play scenarios (RPSs) to teach ethics to first-year engineering students. Role-play discussions serve as a collaborative means for students to discuss and negotiate ethical issues to reach an actionable consensus. We designed a role-play scenario that places students on a university task force that is evaluating the adoption or rejection of facial recognition technologies (FRT) to track and identify the COVID-19 reporting status of students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Students were asked to prepare and then participate in role-play discussions which were then assessed for learning. The data supporting this research comes from the role-play discussion transcripts of 86 first-year engineering students who participated in four sections of an undergraduate engineering concepts class during Fall 2020. Our findings show that students successfully identified a breadth of ethical issues, dilemmas, and topics related to the use of FRT on campus. In addition, students employed an ethical reasoning process to create a group consensus with their peers, supporting the overall goal of developing a more situated understanding of ethical decision-making.",1
Assessing Engineering Student’s Representation and Identification of Ethical Dilemmas through Concept Maps and Role-Plays,"Ashish Hingle, Aditya Johri",2022/8/23,Conference 2022 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"This Research-to-Practice paper presents a study of the use of concept maps for assessing engineering students’ representation and identification of ethical dilemmas. The concept maps were implemented in the context of role-play case studies in a class on technology ethics. Due to the ubiquitous nature of technological applications in the field of engineering, it is important to teach students how to identify and address ethical dilemmas that might emerge through algorithms embedded in different systems. To understand how technology operates, students must explore the context around their implementation and understand the perspective of all stakeholders involved. Role-play scenarios (RPSs) are one pedagogical technique for students to explore nuanced topics and gain a situated perspective. For this study, we implemented RPSs, and data were collected from 56 undergraduate students during the Fall 2020 semester. Students were introduced to the case through a set of resources, including videos, publications, and news articles, and they created a pre-role-play scenario concept map. After participating in the roleplay scenario discussions, students completed a post-discussion concept map as a group activity. Analysis of the pre-and-post concept maps shows students were able to identify a greater number of concepts and ethical dilemmas after participating in the role-play scenario. This research reduces some of the barriers to role-play activities being incorporated in the classroom from an assessment perspective.",1
Improving MOOCs Using Information from Discussion Forums: An Opinion Summarization and Suggestion Mining Approach,"Omaima Almatrafi, Aditya Johri",2022/2/7,Journal IEEE Access,"Discussion forums are integral to MOOCs and a useful resource for collaborative learning. In this paper we examine if the posts made on forums by participants can also provide meaningful information to assess and improve the effectiveness of MOOCs. We present an empirical approach that uses posts in MOOC forums to summarize participants’ opinion towards aspects of a course and identify suggestions for improving a course. Specifically, our approach: (1) detects participants’ attitude towards aspects of a course (e.g. professor, lecture, assignment) at a context or sentence level, (2) extracts suggestions for course improvement, which is a novel space in MOOC learning analytics, and (3) aggregates and displays the results visually.

How FLOSS Participation Supports Lifelong Learning and Working: Apprenticeship Across Time and Spatialities,Aditya Johri,2018/8/22,Book Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Open Collaboration,In this paper I draw on two case studies to examine participatory learning in Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS). I contribute to prior work on learning within FLOSS and also to the learning sciences by illustrating how FLOSS supports lifelong learning and working by providing an ecosystem that allows participants to grow their knowledge of both technical and nontechnical skills over time through their association with different projects and people. I trace the learning trajectories of two participants from high school until they enter the professional workforce and beyond. I argue that FLOSS participation represents an ideal networked form of learning as it provides both socio-cognitive support for short term activities and also socio-temporal support for long term participation and learning. It is a unique form of apprenticeship that exists concurrently with formal educational experiences but unlike traditional …,1
Examining learner-driven constructs in co-curricular engineering environments: The role of student reflection in assessment development,"Lori C Bland, Stephanie Marie Kusano, Xingya Xu, Aditya Johri",2017/6/24,Conference 2017 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"Motivation and Background Co-curricular engineering experiences range from very informal, such as face-to-face social networking within an engineering club to service learning experiences that approximate the workplace. Such experiences situate learning within an environment that may foster integration of knowledge and skills to solve problems (Pierrakos, Borrego, & Lo, 2007). These informal learning environments represent degrees of complexity. Therefore, applying design or problem solving within such environments may also lead to other types of latent outcomes, such as innovative ideas or adaptive expertise, or navigational flexibility (Author, 2014a; Pellegrino, DiBello, & Brophy, 2014; Sawyer & Greeno, 2008; Stevens et al., 2008). However, research about how to assess outcomes attained via participation in informal learning endeavors is nascent. We applied situated learning theory as a theoretical framework (Author, 2014b). We empirically examined student outcomes across six different informal or co-curricular experiences, as aligned with the 11 ABET (2013) student outcomes, outcomes that are critical to students learning to become an engineer (Balascio, 2014). While we report out the results based on the ABET outcomes, the main purposes for this paper were to:(a) examine the nature of the reflective discourse that revealed student self-directed learning of non-cognitive outcomes;(b) investigate the interactive nature of the technical and professional skills outcomes; and (c) explain the methods used to map the reflective discourse to develop assessments of student outcomes.",1

This gap was the impetus for a project–Deep Insights Anytime, Anywhere (DIA2)—that begins to address this problem by focusing on NSF investments in undergraduate STEM education research, and how education innovations make an impact and diffuse throughout the STEM education community. The project team has designed an information portal (http://www. dia2. org) to allow researchers and scientists to browse and search public data from NSF to understand what research has taken place in specific areas and to find collaborators. There are many challenges in developing and using such a cyberinfrastructure, but also many potential advantages for practitioners and researchers.

The identification and emergence of constraints in engineering design projects,"Andrea Goncher, Aditya Johri",2011/6/26,Conference 2011 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"The Identification and Emergence of Constraints in Engineering Design ProjectsThe focus of this paper is on how constraints are identified within design teams and how thecontext of each constraint or a set of constraints shape team design solutions as well as thedesign development over the course of the project. Design is generally constrained by nature, cost, safety, reliability, etc. and the role of these constraints varies based on the context of thedesign project as well as the objectives of the design prompt. The identification and evaluation ofthese constraints differentiates design from conventional optimization when determining orselecting a solution and is an important aspect in studying how solutions evolve throughout thedesign process.

Using Prompted Reflective Journaling to Understand Nontraditional Students in Engineering,"Cory Brozina, Aditya Johri",2022/8/23,Conference 2022 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,This research paper is a study of the support needs of nontraditional students in engineering (NTSE). Nontraditional students in engineering are one segment of the student body that has traditionally not been a part of the conversation in engineering education–those students who do not go through a typical four-year college degree largely at a residential campus. It is only by better understanding the range of issues that NTSE face that we will be able to design interventions and support systems that can assist them. Recent work in engineering education particularly argues that co-curricular support is a critical factor in student success as it effects curricular progress but there has been no work looking specifically at co-curricular support for NTSE and their retention and persistence.,

A Review of Digital Ethnographic Methods with Implications for Engineering Education Research,"Cory Brozina, Aditya Johri, Brent Jesiek, Russ Korte",2021/10/13,Source 2021 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"Full Paper: Digital transformations are reshaping engineering practices with implications for conducting engineering education research. Given the paucity of discussion of digital methods within engineering education research, we believe it is important to examine and present to the community an overview of how digital technology is changing research practices. In this paper we focus on digital ethnography as it has implications for studies of technical education and work, which necessarily involve using, and observing how others employ digital data sources, tools, systems, methods, etc. In this paper we report preliminary results from an in-depth literature search and review. To select the papers for the review, we first examined prior meta-review papers that identified new ethnographic methods appropriate for digital contexts (e.g., network ethnography, trace ethnography, rapid ethnography, connective …",
"A Systematic Review of the ICTD Education and Learning Literature to Identify Scope, Impact, and Areas for Future Work",Aditya Johri,2021/9/9,Source Proceedings of the Conference on Information Technology for Social Good,"In the past couple of decades, the topic of ICT for development (ICTD) has received significant attention and across the globe, researchers, educators, and developers have engaged in projects to study, design, and apply technology to improve education and learning. The expectation that use of information and communication technologies (ICT) will improve education and learning, a critical social good, throughout the world have never been higher. Currently, there is no systematic review of existing literature to better understand what areas have been addressed, their impact, and what are the lessons learned for future work. This paper presents review of work on education and learning with ICT. We focus on the ICTD literature as it has a mature body of work and engages directly with the goal of doing good with technology.

Using Role Play Scenarios to Teach Ethical Thinking,"Ashish Hingle, Aditya Johri, Huzefa Rangwala, Alex Monea",2021/9/2,Journal Innovations in Teaching & Learning Conference Proceedings,"Algorithms affect decision-making through many domains in our world today. From communication between people to measuring financial risk, industrial manufacturing to proctoring tools for remote learning, algorithms drive decision-making in many disciplines, even those outside of computing and technology. Ultimately, algorithms affect how people interact with each other and the world. This widespread push for automation of everyday activities relies on computing and technology professionals, who depend on their foundational knowledge of algorithms to create solutions to the human condition. Therefore, it is fundamental that students who are building this foundational knowledge of developing and manipulating algorithms through their coursework are aware of the benefits, implications, and consequences of this decision-making. Although there are several ways that this ethics-focused thinking can be taught in a classroom, there is no standardized curriculum for ethics coursework. This research project reports findings from a study of the design, implementation, and evaluation of the use of role play scenarios (RPS) for teaching student's ethical decision-making in algorithm-rich work environments. This presentation's primary outcome is to discuss how to implement role plays through an active learning environment to discuss ethics-related topics in computing and technology courses. The discussion is based on feedback from participants of past role plays can be applied to using role play activities in other disciplines",
Improving Diversity in Engineering: A Data-Driven Approach to Support Resource Mobilization and Participation in Hashtag Activism Campaigns,"Habib Karbasian, Hemant Purohit, Aditya Johri",2021/8/30,Book Proceedings of the 32nd ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media,"A critical barrier facing engineering is inclusiveness of women in the profession. In recent years, engineering diversity advocates have taken to social media platforms to raise awareness of the issue and redress this problem. A recurring challenge for their initiatives though is attracting and mobilizing participants efficiently. For a successful mobilization campaign, organizers need real-time information about their users and also need to understand what messaging works to attract and mobilize them. We hypothesize that participants in any given campaign related to engineering diversity will also be interested in other campaigns related to that issue. Furthermore, since the primary signal for a social media campaign is a hashtag, by using clustering patterns of various co-occurring hashtags along with relevant topics and relatable sentiments, we can better understand participation and also mobilize users for the target …",
CONFRONTING HATE IS JUST THE START,Aditya Johri,2021/7/1,Journal ASEE Prism,"Hate is rising against Asians--Asian Americans, Americans of Asian descent, and Asian immigrants--across the US. Among the broader population of Asians who live here are those, like Johri, who arrived as immigrants and exist in the microcosm of academia and, within that, in engineering schools. It is through this lived experience that he stresses that anti-Asian views leading to the recent spike in violence have also manifested themselves as prejudice, bias, discrimination, and, at best, neutrality in academia for decades. His trajectory, like that of many Asians in engineering, can be traced back to the 1965 removal of the national origin-based quota system for immigration. Post-World War II, US engineering schools had developed an outstanding reputation worldwide and, in combination with a law that allowed non-Western immigrants to enter America, universities were able to attract the brightest minds from Asia …",

Building resilience following a policy shock: Evidence from India’s demonetization,"Amrita Lahiri, Nanjundi Karthick Krishnan, Alex Kier, Joyojeet Pal, Aditya Johri",2021,Journal Academy of Management Proceedings,"Greater resource endowments are assumed to help the resiliency of businesses involved in a crisis. We challenge this assumption using the context of a unique natural experiment – India’s demonetization policy shock in November 2016, when the Indian Government removed, without any warning, 86% of the country’s currency in circulation, thereby precipitating large-scale disruption amongst small businesses in India. We take a multi-method approach to examine the effects of demonetization on 294 small businesses to show that resource endowments (financial and human capital) do not ensure business resilience. Using motivated cognition as a theoretical lens, we argue and empirically demonstrate that resources facilitate business resilience when the entrepreneur identifies with the political party enacting the policy but do not appear effective in facilitating resilience when the entrepreneur does not identify …",
Learning Analytics for Learning Assessment,"Carrie Klein, Jaime Lester, Huzefa Rangwala, Aditya Johri",2020/11/3,Journal Big Data on Campus: Data Analytics and Decision Making in Higher Education,"THE RISE of educational technology in academia is transforming teaching and learning. Among the educational technologies in use in academia today are learning management systems (LMS), early alert or early warning advising systems (EWS), and other tools that provide information on and management of student performance, course retention, and degree progress. At the same time, the capacity to harvest, store, and analyze large data sets, via data mining, analytics, and machine learning technologies, has also expanded (Ferguson and Clow 2017; Peña-Ayala 2018). As a result, educational technologies are increasingly employing learning analytics–based tools to make meaning of the vast amounts of data produced by higher education organizations and their members. Learning analytics are educational Big Data that govern “the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for the purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs”(Siemens 2013, 3). These educational Big Data, which are inclusive of student demographic, performance, and location data and that span curricular and co-curricular interactions, can illuminate trends that may not be visible via smaller data sets (Long and Siemens 2011). Defined by their volume, variety, and velocity of delivery, learning analytics data provide organizations with the potential to rapidly respond to complex organizational demands. The real-time, personalized, and actionable feedback provided by learning analytics can support decision making for administrators, faculty, and students alike. Through …",
HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF AI,Aditya Johri,2020/10/1,Journal ASEE Prism,"Johri focuses on how engineering educators and researchers can make the most of AI. Most AI experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI), the kind of AI that can work just like the human brain, is a long way off. However, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) is making rapid progress. Although ANI has limitations and biases, its applications--driverless cars, drone deliveries, and conversations with Alexa--were unfathomable except as science fiction just a few years back. By offloading our thinking and exchange of ideas to an external representational system--a language--ANI enables them to handle complexity they might not otherwise have tackled. In the near-term, the engineering education community can use AI to make a meaningful impact in three areas: data, content, and workforce automation.",
"Little Woes, One Great Problem: Gaps in coordination, execution, and expectation plague online teaching",Aditya Johri,2020,Journal ASEE Prism,"Great subjects are illuminated best by small dramas, the writer VS Naipaul once remarked. I was reminded of this adage while dealing with an incident during an online class. It occurred right around the end of the semester and, not surprisingly, had to do with grading. A student was certain an online assignment had been completed on time and contested receiving a zero grade for missing the deadline. A similar episode might play out in a face-to-face, on-campus, class. Yet, there are nuances to online teaching that can turn such small dramas, collectively, into a great problem that eats away at teaching time and faculty-student relations.",
Sisyphus in the Digital Workplace: Today's IT professionals must keep up with both continuous demands for new skills and new ways of learning,Aditya Johri,2019/10/1,Journal ASEE Prism,"For engineering professionals, workplace learning is in a turbulent state. As the work of engineers and technologists continues to change, so does the knowledge required to perform that work. Accompanying the requirement for continuous learning is the need to adjust to new ways of learning. Most critically, the fusion of changing knowledge and ways in which that knowledge can be acquired is giving rise to new practices of learning that are novel because they are both reified and malleable; they become entrenched but are also continuously changing. When it came to learning for the future, things were a little complicated. The rapid pace of work made it hard to keep up, and their jobs afforded little time for exploration.",
The Age of Analytics: How to Design Better Data-Driven Tools,Aditya Johri,2019/2/1,Journal ASEE Prism,"Each year, universities spend millions of dollars on their IT infrastructure. This infrastructure supports teaching, through learning management systems (LMS) such as BlackBoard or Moodle, and research such as experiments and analyses that require high-performance computing. In the past decade, analytics systems that leverage big data have become a standard across different industries. It is no secret that most technology adoption projects are unsuccessful. In our research, we have identified a few steps that can be taken to mitigate the risks of adopting new technology related to learning analytics (LA). First, as is common for most technology adoption processes, a crucial requirement to ensure that LA can be integrated into existing organizational routines is to design technology with a user-centered approach.",

Situated Information Seeking for Learning: A Case Study of Workplace Cognition among Cybersecurity Professionals,"H Le, A Johri, A Malik",2018/1,Journal Proceedings of ASEE Annual Conference,"Workforce development in engineering is a high priority to keep pace with innovation and change within engineering disciplines and also within organizations. Increasingly, workforce development requires more retraining and retooling of employees than ever before as information technology has accelerated both the creation of a new body of knowledge and also the skills required to perform the work. In this paper we present a field study of a highly dynamic workplace – a cybersecurity firm – undertaken to better understand how engineers keep up with the pace of knowledge that is needed for their work. Fifteen professionals, with a wide range of experience and educational background, were interviewed. Data were analyzed iteratively and interpretively. The findings from the study suggest that over time some well-defined ways of learning had developed in the workplace we studied. These learning practices combined in-person and online interactions and resources. We also found that learning was triggered largely by the need to solve a problem or by the interests of the engineers to learn more in order to be prepared for new knowledge in the field. Depending on the problem they faced, the engineers mapped the requirements of what was needed to solve the problem, identified the resources that were available, and then selected the optimal resource. Often, as is common with problem solving, our participants had to try out multiple options. Theoretically, our study contributes by integrating an information seeking perspective with situated cognition to inform future studies of learning in information rich engineering and technology workplaces.",
An Engineering Conundrum: What will we do when machines do everything,Aditya Johri,2018,Journal ASEE Prism,"On a recent research trip to India I fell into conversation with the owner of a small shop whose primary business was serving mobile phone customers. In a country where most customers pay as they go for their mobile phone use, he helps customers pick from among dozens of available plans while also selling handsets. I was in India collecting data for a study on how mobile technology is allowing people without bank accounts to become a part of the formal financial system. We are in the initial phase of this transformation. Right now, creation of jobs through services such as Uber and Lyft and of revenue through Airbnb look like positive developments. Yet, in the near future, when self-driving cars and trucks become commonplace, a lot of these jobs will cease to exist.",
A Go-to Resource for Engineers: Participations in online forums not only share what they know but also generate new knowledge,Aditya Johri,2017/10/1,Journal ASEE Prism,"Johri cites that since the advent of the Internet, users have leveraged it to communicate with others for fun and socialization but also to obtain information or help from online communities. Over time, these communities have emerged as a critical resource for problem solving across a range of domains--from health and wellbeing to software development and 3-D printing. Over the past decade, his research lab has been studying how these communities work and what kind of help they provide users. What they and others have found is that online communities are an excellent resource for problem solving--especially for those working on engineering and technology-related problems. Furthermore, given the fast pace of technological development and the dynamic ways new knowledge is spreading, online communities are becoming the first line of approach, the go-to resource, for most engineers.

Am I My Machine's Keeper? Devices that learn from and influence users pose new ethical dilemmas,Aditya Johri,2017,Journal ASEE Prism,"The prospect of autonomous vehicles presents a variation on an old philosophy question: You are in your driverless car and a child stumbles on to the road. What action should your car take? Should it run into a wall, possibly killing you, or run over the child? The new ethical twist, of course, is this: Should the choice be programmed into the car--engineered--or should a button be provided so the driver can choose the setting? Other programmable technology is not so innocuous. A major example is the programming of slot machines in casinos to encourage high-risk, addicted gamblers to play even more. By making it seem as if they have almost won a jackpot, or by providing them easier access to loans, these machines target humans' vulnerability.",
Mediating Access: How Visually Impaired Users Leverage Collaborative Learning to Keep Up With Mobile Phone Innovations,"Joyojeet Pal, Anandhi Viswanathan, Aditya Johri",2017,"Publisher Philadelphia, PA: International Society of the Learning Sciences.","We illustrate learning strategies used by visually impaired mobile phone users to support device information gathering and troubleshooting. Observing experiences of adult mobile users in Bangalore, India, we find that functional access and device familiarity is acquired through a range of digital and interpersonal consultations. We find that generic smartphones are increasingly becoming primary digital assistive devices due to their in-built accessibility features, yet the available information and user guides on these devices is biased towards sighted users. Consequently, device users rely on collaboratively learning from peers for general device familiarity and troubleshooting.  We propose that collaborative learning will likely be a central to technology adoption and maintenance as artifacts and interfaces evolve constantly, forcing people for whose needs the devices may not have originally been designed, to learn and adapt constantly.",

Given that service-learning has demonstrated positive outcomes on student learning and development, we believed it was important to examine why students, and faculty, might want to engage with these projects. Our reading of that work as well as associated literature alerted us to some potential reasons why students, as well as other stakeholders, might engage with service-learning projects and what faculty can do to leverage their interest and make their engagement stronger. The first explanation for working on service-learning projects is prosocial motivation, which is the desire to expend effort to benefit other people [Batson, 1987, 1998]. When prosocially …",

The socio-technical process of newcomer participation: lessons from a field study,Aditya Johri,2007,"Publisher International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.","Newcomer participation is fundamental to most organizations yet we have limited understanding of how this process unfolds in real world organizations. In this paper I present preliminary findings from a field study of five newcomers in a research and development laboratory. The findings show that to move from peripheral to full participation newcomers make use of both interpersonal and technological resources available within the organization. In addition to these resources, newcomers' participation trajectories depend on experiences that they bring with when they enter the organization. These experiences provide templates that influence and shape consequent participation. The findings also suggest that as newcomers participate in a community they influence oldtimers as well as established practices in that community, suggesting that a community of practice undergoes changes as a result of newcomer participation.",

Designing for Change: Findings from an Ethnographic Study of a Complex Learning Environment,Aditya Johri,"The design of a learning environment is just the beginning of a process that aims to end with successful adoption and use of that environment for valuable learning goals. To discover elements that influence communication and collaboration in a complex setting this ethnographic study explored the Global Classroom Project, a test-bed designed to examine issues of crosscultural collaboration in an educational setting. The findings indicate that although some factors that influence a learning environment stay constant over time others do not and that it is critical to catalogue these factors. The findings further identify the benefits of continually evaluating an environment after it is implemented in a natural setting and of a flexible design of the learning environment.",Scholar articles Designing for Change: Findings from an Ethnographic Study of a Complex Learning EnvironmentA JohriRelated articles All 2 versions ,"The design of a learning environment is just the beginning of a process that aims to end with successful adoption and use of that environment for valuable learning goals.

Knowing Others: Understanding Interpersonal Impression Formation Among Learners in Technology-Mediated Communities of Practice,Aditya Johri,Computer Supported Collaborative Learning 2005: The Next 10 Years!,Pages 75,"The use of technology in educational settings, especially for communication and interaction, is almost ubiquitous. For my dissertation, I propose to study how learners in technology-mediated educational settings learn about each other in order to learn from each other. Interpersonal knowledge about participants in a community of practice is essential for knowledge sharing and learning to take place and technology-mediation fundamentally changes how people learn about each other. Drawing on literature from social psychology, learning sciences, and computer-mediated communication, I propose to investigate how people form impressions of each other in technology-mediated settings using a qualitative field study of a geographically distributed learning setting. The significant contribution of my research for education is in explicating a key and fundamental aspect of technology–how it mediates and transforms educational settings, especially its effect on how learners’ learn about each other. This research is critical since a better theoretical understanding of social aspects of technologymediation is key for designing effective computer-supported learning environments.",
VisOC: A Tool for Visualizing Online Communication in Educational Settings,"Jason Civjan, Aditya Johri, Cassie Avery, TyAnna Herrington","The archives of computer-mediated communication (CMC) are valuable resources that contain explicit and implicit knowledge about the interaction among the different participants. We present VisOC, a tool that leverages localized contextual knowledge to visualize online communication relevant to a specific user. These visual representations can provide a sense of what is going on in the class “at a glance”. A busy instructor can get an overview of pertinent information and then can zoom in to get relevant details. A fully functional prototype of the tool is now available on the Web and we are currently working on increasing the functionality and scalability of the tool.","Scholar articles VisOC: A Tool for Visualizing Online Communication in Educational SettingsJ Civjan, A Johri, C Avery, TA HerringtonRelated articles All 2 versions ","The archives of computer-mediated communication (CMC) are valuable resources that contain explicit and implicit knowledge about the interaction among the different participants.

Living Inside the Poem: Enhancing English Literature Classes with MOOs,"Ron Broglio, Aditya Johri","MUDs Object-Oriented, or MOOs, have been used in education for a long time. Yet, there are very few studies that exemplify the integrated use of MOOs within the curricula. Realizing that MOOs can play an important role in literature classes, this study analyzes the integration of MOOs in English literature curricula using activity-centered design as framework. This approach seeks to find an alternative to using computers in a tacked on fashion, as some additional component not related to the course content, or letting the computer software dictate course content. The Romantic Circles project is a high quality, editorially controlled, collaborative Internet resource for education and Villa Diodati is the MOO associated with the project. This paper reports results on integration of the Villa Diodati MOO in college level English literature classes.When introducing computers into a humanities course, there is often a concern that the technology will overtake the class content rather than serve as a handmaid in delivering ideas to students. Despite the seemingly disjunctive nature of humanities computing, teachers feel the demand from administrations, students, and contemporary culture to make computer use part of course design. Navigating these demands alongside curriculum requirements can be difficult and the challenge of humanities computing is to find a balance between using computers in a tacked on fashion or letting the computer software dictate course content. MUDs Object-Oriented, or MOOs, have been used in education for a long time. After their beginning as role-playing games, and their popularity as social spaces (Curtis, 1992), MOOs have …","Scholar articles Living Inside the Poem: Enhancing English Literature Classes with MOOsR Broglio, A JohriRelated articles All 3 versions ","MUDs Object-Oriented, or MOOs, have been used in education for a long time.
