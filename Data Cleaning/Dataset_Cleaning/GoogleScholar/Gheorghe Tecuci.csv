"Building Intelligent Agents: An Apprenticeship, Multistrategy Learning Theory, Methodology, Tool and Case Studies","Gheorghe Tecuci, Tomasz Dybala",1998/6/23,Publisher Morgan Kaufmann,"Building Intelligent Agents is unique in its comprehensive coverage of the subject. The first part of the book presents an original theory for building intelligent agents and a methodology and tool that implement the theory. The second part of the book presents complex and detailed case studies of building different types of agents: an educational assessment agent, a statistical analysis assessment and support agent, an engineering design assistant, and a virtual military commander. Also featured in this book is Disciple, a toolkit for building interactive agents which function in much the same way as a human apprentice. Disciple-based agents can reason both with incomplete information, but also with information that is potentially incorrect. This approach, in which the agent learns its behavior from its teacher, integrates many machine learning and knowledge acquisition techniques, taking advantage of their complementary strengths to compensate for each others weakness. As a consequence, it significantly reduces (or even eliminates) the involvement of a knowledge engineer in the process of building an intelligent agent.",287
Apprenticeship learning in imperfect domain theories,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Yves Kodratoff",1990/1/1,Book Machine learning,"This chapter presents DISCIPLE, a multistrategy, integrated learning system illustrating a theory and a methodology for learning expert knowledge in the context of an imperfect domain theory. DISCIPLE integrates a learning system and an empty expert system, both using the same knowledge base. It is initially provided with an imperfect (nonhomogeneous) domain theory and learns problem-solving rules from the problem-solving steps received from its expert user, during interactive problem-solving sessions. In this way, DISCIPLE evolves from a helpful assistant in problem solving to a genuine expert. The problem-solving method of DISCIPLE combines problem reduction, problem solving by constraints, and problem solving by analogy. The learning method of DISCIPLE depends on its knowledge about the problem-solving step (the example) from which it learns. In the context of a complete theory about the …",96
Seven aspects of mixed-initiative reasoning: An introduction to this special issue on mixed-initiative assistants,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu, Michael T Cox",2007/6/15,Journal AI Magazine,"Mixed-initiative assistants are agents that interact seamlessly with humans to extend their problem-solving capabilities or provide new capabilities. Developing such agents requires the synergistic integration of many areas of AI, including knowledge representation, problem solving and planning, knowledge acquisition and learning, multiagent systems, discourse theory, and human-computer interaction. This paper introduces seven aspects of mixed-initiative reasoning (task, control, awareness, communication, personalization, architecture, and evaluation) and discusses them in the context of several state-of-the-art mixed-initiative assistants. The goal is to provide a framework for understanding and comparing existing mixed-initiative assistants and for developing general design principles and methods.",78

"Intelligence analysis as discovery of evidence, hypotheses, and arguments: Connecting the dots","Gheorghe Tecuci, David A Schum, Dorin Marcu, Mihai Boicu",2016/8/30,Publisher Cambridge University Press,"This unique book on intelligence analysis covers several vital but often overlooked topics. It teaches the evidential and inferential issues involved in'connecting the dots' to draw defensible and persuasive conclusions from masses of evidence: from observations we make, or questions we ask, we generate alternative hypotheses as explanations or answers; we make use of our hypotheses to generate new lines of inquiry and discover new evidence; and we test the hypotheses with the discovered evidence. To facilitate understanding of these issues and enable the performance of complex analyses, the book introduces an intelligent analytical tool, called Disciple-CD. Readers will practice with Disciple-CD and learn how to formulate hypotheses; develop arguments that reduce complex hypotheses to simpler ones; collect evidence to evaluate the simplest hypotheses; and assess the relevance and the believability of evidence, which combine in complex ways to determine its inferential force and the probabilities of the hypotheses.",43
Learning based on conceptual distance,"Yves Kodratoff, Gheorghe Tecuci",1988/11,Journal IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,"An approach to concept learning from examples and concept learning by observation is presented that is based on a intuitive notion of conceptual distance between examples (concepts) and combines symbolical and numerical methods. The approach is based on the observation that very different examples generalize to an expression that is very far from each of them, while identical examples generalize to themselves. Following this idea the authors propose some domain-independent and intuitively justified estimates for the conceptual distance. A hierarchical conceptual clustering algorithm that groups objects so as to maximize the cohesiveness (a reciprocal of the conceptual distance) of the clusters is presented. It is shown that conceptual clustering can improve learning from complex examples describing objects and the relation between them.< >",43

Disciple-COA can collaborate with the expert to develop its knowledge base consisting of a frame-based ontology that defines the terms from the application domain, and a set of plausible version space rules expressed with these terms. Its central component is a plausible reasoner that can distinguish between four types of problem solving situations: routine, innovative, inventive and creative. This ability guides the interactions with the expert during which the agent learns general rules from specific examples, by integrating a wide range of knowledge acquisition and machine learning strategies, including apprenticeship learning, empirical inductive learning from examples and explanations, and analogical learning.

Plausible justification trees: A framework for deep and dynamic integration of learning strategies,Gheorghe Tecuci,1993/5,Journal Machine Learning,"This article describes a framework for the deep and dynamic integration of learning strategies. The framework is based on the idea that each single-strategy learning method is ultimately the result of certain elementary inferences (like deduction, analogy, abduction, generalization, specialization, abstraction, concretion, etc.). Consequently, instead of integrating learning strategies at a macro level, we propose to integrate the different inference types that generate individual learning strategies. The article presents a concept-learning and theory-revision method that was developed in this framework. It allows the system to learn from one or from several (positive and/or negative) examples, and to both generalize and specialize its knowledge base. The method integrates deeply and dynamically different learning strategies, depending on the relationship between the input information and the knowledge base. It …",31

The method assumes a general learning goal of deriving any useful knowledge from a given input and integrates dynamically a whole range of learning strategies. It also behaves as a single-strategy method when the relationship between the input and the BK satisfies the requirements of the single-strategy method, and the general learning goal of the MTL method is specialized to the goal of the single-strategy method.",30

Building knowledge bases through multistrategy learning and knowledge acquisition,Gheorghe Tecuci,1995/6/1,Journal Machine learning and knowledge acquisition: Integrated approaches,"This paper presents a new approach to the process of building a knowledge-based system which relies on a tutoring paradigm rather than traditional knowledge engineering. In this approach, an expert teaches the knowledge based system in much the same way the expert would teach a human student, by providing specific examples of problems and solutions, explanations of these solutions, or supervise the system as it solves new problems. During such interactions, the system extends and corrects its knowledge base until the expert is satisfied with its performance. Three main features characterize this approach. First, it is based on a multistrategy learning method that dynamically integrates the elementary inferences that are employed by the single-strategy learning methods. Second, much of the knowledge needed by the system is generated by the system itself. Therefore, most of the time, the expert will need only to confirm or reject system-generated hypotheses. Third, the knowledge base development process is efficient due to the ability of the multistrategy learner to reuse its reasoning process, as well as the employment of plausible version spaces for controlling the knowledge base development process. This paper illustrates a cooperation between a learning system and a human expert in which the learner performs most of the tasks and the expert helps it in solving the problems that are intrinsically difficult for a learner and relatively easy for an expert.",18

A framework for knowledge base refinement through multistrategy learning and knowledge acquisition,"Gheorghe Tecuci, David Duff",1994/6/1,Journal Knowledge Acquisition,"This paper presents a general approach to knowledge base refinement which integrates multistrategy learning, active experimentation and guided knowledge elicitation. Three main features characterize this approach. First, knowledge base refinement is based on a multistrategy learning method that dynamically integrates the elementary inferences (such as deduction, analogy, abduction, generalization, specialization, abstraction and concretion) that are employed by the single-strategy learning methods. Second, much of the knowledge needed by the system to refine its knowledge base is generated by the system itself. Therefore, most of the time, the human expert will need only to confirm or reject system-generated hypotheses. Third, the knowledge base refinement process is efficient due to the ability of the multistrategy learner to reuse its reasoning process. The paper illustrates a cooperation between a …",14

The system has an incomplete and partially incorrect representation of the external world, in the knowledge base KB, and receives new input information from the environment. The learning goal is to extend, update and/or improve the KB, so as to consistently integrate the information contained in the input.

The second one emphasizes the importance of explanations understandable by a human user, ie, provided in his/her own language. In a first part, we analyze different kinds of imperfections in the knowledge that can be taken care of by symbolic approaches.

Military Applications of the Disciple Learning Agent,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu",2002,Journal Advanced Information Systems in Defense and Related Applications,"This chapter presents an overview of the Disciple approach and its military applications. Disciple is a theory, methodology, and family of agent shells for the development of intelligent agents by subject matter experts, with limited assistance from computer scientists or knowledge engineers [1].

The agent learns from the expert by generalizing the examples and the explanations to build its knowledge base. The Disciple approach integrates methods for mixed-initiative problem solving, teaching, and multistrategy learning, exploiting the complementariness between human and automated reasoning, and creating a synergism between the expert that has the knowledge to be formalized and the agent that knows how to formalize it.

Since the user always provides totally instantiated rules, the system must automatically variabilize them, and then must find the validity domain of these variables by asking “clever” questions to the user. Given a particular (instantiated) rule by its user, the system will look in its knowledge base for possible explanations of this rule, and ask the user to validate them. The set of explanations validated by the user is then used as a set of sufficient conditions for the application of the instantiated rule. The system over-generalizes (simply by turning all constants into variables) this rule to generate a generalized rule.",7
How learning enables intelligence analysts to rapidly develop practical cognitive assistants,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu, Dorin Marcu, David Schum",2013/12/4,Conference 2013 12th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications,"This paper overviews an end-to-end learning-based approach to the rapid development of practical cognitive assistants for intelligence analysis. A learning agent shell has been trained by a knowledge engineer with general evidence-based reasoning knowledge for intelligence analysis. This agent is further trained by an expert analyst how to analyze complex hypotheses from a given intelligence analysis domain. The resulting cognitive assistant is used by a typical analyst to rapidly analyze hypotheses from agent's area of expertise. During its use, the agent continues to learn reasoning patterns from its user. This approach has been implemented and practical agents have been developed and used.

Toward a computational theory of evidence-based reasoning,"Gheorghe Tecuci, David Schum, Mihai Boicu, Dorin Marcu, Katherine Russell",2011/5/24,Journal Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Control Systems and Computer Science,"Evidence-based reasoning is at the core of many problem solving and decision making tasks in a wide variety of domains. Through abductive reasoning we generate hypotheses from our observations; through deductive reasoning we use our hypotheses to generate new lines of inquiry and discover new evidence; and through inductive reasoning we test our hypotheses with this discovered evidence. These processes, which integrate imaginative and critical reasoning, are often stunningly complex because our evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, ambiguous, dissonant, and has various degrees of believability. We present research performed in the Learning Agents Center of George Mason University on developing a Computational Theory of Evidence-based Reasoning viewed as mixed-initiative integration of evidence in search of hypotheses, hypotheses in search of evidence, and evidential tests of hypotheses, all taking place simultaneously, in a world that is changing all the time. This theory is embedded in the Disciple cognitive agents which are capable of capturing tacit knowledge from subject matter experts, and can act as assistants to experts, as expert consultants to non-experts, or as intelligent tutors to students. We illustrate the applications of these agents in various domains, including intelligence analysis and inquiry-based learning in natural sciences.",5

The investigated approach, called Disciple (Tecuci, 1998), relies on developing a very capable learning and reasoning agent that can collaborate with a domain expert to develop its knowledge base consisting of an ontology that defines the terms from the application domain, and a set of general task reduction rules expressed with these terms. An important component of this research is the development of a general methodology for modeling and representing expert knowledge that supports teachingbased intelligent agent development. With respect to this methodology we formulate the following claims: 1) it is natural for the expert, 2) it is applicable to a wide variety of domains; 3) it identifies the tasks to be represented in the agent’s knowledge base, 4) it identifies the necessary concepts and features to be represented in the ontology, 5) it guides the rule learning process 6) it supports natural language generation of solutions by the agent and their abstract justifications.",5

Complementary Approaches to Instructable Agents for Advanced Persistent Threats Detection,"Juan Huang, Zhemin An, Steven Meckl, Gheorghe Tecuci, Dorin Marcu",2020/9/1,Journal Studies in Informatics and Control,"Large CSOCs (cybersecurity operation centers) must analyze tens of thousands of security incidents per day. Not only that there are not enough cybersecurity analysts available but the average cost of a cybersecurity analyst keeps going up. This paper presents a novel approach to the detection of APTs (advanced persistent threats), where an expert cybersecurity analyst directly teaches (rather than programs) a cognitive agent how to investigate cybersecurity alerts, as the analyst would teach a student, through explained examples of investigations. It then presents two complementary instantiations of this approach, as implemented in ADONIS (Automating the ATT&CKTM-based Detection Of Novel Network Intrusions System) and CAAPT (Cognitive Agent for APT detection). ADONIS detects adversary’s behavior in terms of MITRE’s ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge), independent of specific malware and tools. It can therefore detect novel intrusions, but is expected to be less efficient because of the multitude of tactics and techniques that can be employed. CAAPT only detects known malware based on combinations of weak IOCs (indicators of compromise) and, as demonstrated by the experimental results, is efficient. Therefore, once a new malware is detected with ADONIS, its IOCs can be identified and CAAPT can be trained to rapidly detect it. This instructable agents approach promises to significantly reduce the cost of operating the CSOCs and improve their detection performance by automating much of the analysts’ investigative activity. It increases the probability of detecting intrusion activity and reduces the …",4

The investigated solution consists of developing a very capable learning agent shell that can perform many of the functions of a knowledge engineer. As an expert system shell, the learning agent shell includes a general problem solving engine that can be reused for multiple applications. In addition, it includes a multistrategy learning engine for building its knowledge base (KB) which has two main components: an object ontology that defines the concepts from a specific application domain, and a set of task reduction rules expressed with these concepts. The subject matter expert and the agent engage into a mixed-initiative reasoning process during which the expert is teaching the agent his problem solving expertise, and the agent learns from the expert, building, verifying, and improving its KB. Over the years we have developed a series of increasingly more capable learning agent shells from the Disciple family. The most recent family member, Disciple-RKF/COG, represents a significant advancement over its predecessors. It implements a more powerful plausible version space representation that allows all the types of knowledge from the KB (not only the rules, but also the objects and the tasks) to be learned with similar methods.

Disciple is an apprenticeship, multistrategy learning agent that can be taught by an expert how to perform domain-specific tasks in a way that resembles the way an apprentice would be taught by the expert. Disciple has been taught by an educator to generate and answer basic test questions and to explain the answers. From its interaction with the educational expert, Disciple has learned general rules that allow it to generate a large number of new test questions for students, together with hints, answers, and explanations of the answers. As a result, it can guide the students during their practice of higher-order thinking skills as they would be directly guided by the educator. The Disciple agent is also a useful tool for the educator, being able to generate a different exam for each student in the class.

This approach relies on a Disciple learning agent that can be trained to solve problems by an expert. First, however, a knowledge engineer has to work with the expert to define the object ontology of Disciple. This ontology consists of hierarchical descriptions of objects and features from the application domain. Then, the expert can teach Disciple to solve problems in a way that resembles how the expert would teach a student. For instance, the expert defines a specific problem, helps the agent to understand each reasoning step toward the solution, and supervises and corrects the agent‘s behavior, when it attempts to solve new problems. During such mixed-initiative interactions, the agent learns general problem solving rules from individual problem solving steps and their explanations of success or failure.

A characteristic feature of this approach is that a detailed specification of the ontology to be developed results from a conceptual modeling of the application domain of the knowledge-based agent to be built. This specification guides the process of building the ontology which consists in importing knowledge from external knowledge servers, and in using the ontology building tools of Disciple. Knowledge import and reuse are facilitated by the fact that the representation of the ontology is based on the OKBC knowledge model.

"Mixed-Initiative Reasoning for Integrated Domain Modeling, Learning and Problem Solving","Mihai Boicu, Gheorghe Tecuci",2000,Journal PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"The main challenge addressed by this research is the knowledge acquisition bottleneck defined as the difficulty of creating and maintaining a knowledge base that represents a model of the exp ertise domain that exists in the mind of a domain expert. The mixed-initiative approach we are investigating, called Disciple (Tecuci et al. 1999; Boicu et al., 2000), relies on developing a very capable agent that can collaborate with the domain expert to develop its knowledge base. In this approach both the agent and the expert are accorded responsibility for those elements of knowledge engineering for which they have the most aptitude, and together they form a complete team for knowledge base development. The domain modeling and problem solving approach is based on task reduction paradigm. The knowledge base to be developed consisting of an OKBC-type ontology that defines the terms from the application domain, and a set of plausible task reduction rules expressed with these terms. The main focus of our research is the development of a powerful and flexible mixed-initiative plausible reasoner that allows the expert to train the agent in a variety of ways, and in as natural a manner as possible, similar to the way the expert would train a human apprentice. This reasoner exploits the structure of the ontology and of the plausible task reduction rules to integrate the domain modeling, learning and problem solving processes involved in developing the knowledge base of the agent. The goal is to develop a knowledge base that will allow the agent to exhibit a problem solving competence that is similar with that of the domain expert. We call the set of …",1
Knowledge Base Revision through Exception-driven Discovery and Learning.,"Seok Won Lee, Gheorghe Tecuci",1999/7/18,Conference AAAI/IAAI,"We are currently witnessing a trend toward an architectural separation of a knowledge base (KB) into an ontology and a set of rules. The ontology is a description of the concepts and relationships from the application domain; the rules are problem solving procedures expressed with the terms from the ontology. Moreover, terminological standardization taking place in more and more domains has led to the development of domain ontologies. These two developments raise the prospect of reusing existing ontologies when building a new knowledge based system. For instance, the Disciple approach for building a knowledge based agent relies on importing ontologies from existing repositories of knowledge, and on teaching the agent how to perform various tasks, in a way that resembles how an expert would teach a human apprentice when solving problems in cooperation (Tecuci, 1998; Tecuci et al. 1999). In Disciple, the ontology serves as the generalization hierarchy for learning, an example being basically generalized to a rule by replacing its objects with more general objects from the ontology. However, the learning works well only if the ontology contains all the concepts needed to represent the application domain. We make the assumption that an ontology built from previously developed KBs will contain useful concepts, but it is incomplete and will not contain the more subtle distinctions needed for competent and efficient problem solving in a particular domain. These missing concepts will manifest themselves as exceptions to the learned problem solving rules. A negative exception of the rule is a negative example that is covered by the rule …",1

Knowledge Acquisition,"Gheorghe Tecuci, S Kedar, Y Kodratoff",1994,Journal Special issue on the integration of machine learning and knowledge acquisition,"This chapter presents a new approach to the process of building a knowledge-based system which relies on a tutoring paradigm rather than traditional knowledge engineering. In this approach, an expert teaches the knowledge-based system in much the same way the expert would teach a human student, by providing specific examples of problems and solutions, explanations of these solutions, or supervising the system as it solves new problems. During such interactions, the system extends and corrects its knowledge base until the expert is satisfied with its performance. Three main features characterize this approach. First, it is based on a multistrategy learning method that dynamically integrates the elementary inferences that are employed by the single-strategy learning methods. Second, much of the knowledge needed by the system is generated by the system itself. Therefore, most of the time, the expert will need only to confirm or reject system-generated hypotheses. Third, the knowledge-base devel-opment process is efficient due to the ability of the multistrategy learner to reuse its reasoning process, as well as the employment of plausible version spaces for controlling the knowledge-base development process. This chapter illustrates a cooperation between a learning system and a human expert in which the learner performs most of the tasks and the expert helps it in solving the problems that are intrinsically difficult for a learner and relatively easy for an expert. a",1

The instructor formulates an inquiry and the students hypothesize possible answers. Then they use sInvestigator to determine the hypothesized answer that is best supported by evidence. They form teams, each team developing an evidence-based argumentation for assessing the probability of their selected hypothesized answer. Using sInvestigator, they decompose their hypothesis into simpler and simpler hypotheses, until the top hypothesis is reduced to very simple (elementary) hypotheses, each showing clearly what evidence may favor or disfavor it. This guides the students to search for this evidence on the Internet, and assess its relevance and credibility by using fuzzy qualifiers, such as “likely” or “almost certain”. Based on these student assessments, sInvestigator determines the probabilities of the elementary hypotheses, and combines them to obtain the probability of the hypothesized answer. The students may be asked to perform deeper credibility analyses of the Internet articles found, by assessing lower-level credentials, such as author’s competence, conflicts of interest, and publication reputation.

Learning Best Concept Approximations from Examples,"Mihai Boicu, Gheorghe Tecuci",2005,Journal International Journal of Computational Intelligence Research,"This paper addresses the problem of learning the best approximation of a concept from examples, when the concept cannot be expressed in the learner’s representation language. It presents a method that determines the version space of the best approximations and demonstrates that for any given approximation of the target concept there is a better approximation in this version space. The method does not depend on the order of examples and has an almost monotonic convergence. This method was developed for the Disciple learning agent that can be taught by a subject matter expert how to perform complex problem solving tasks.",
Information Age Warfare-Intelligent Agents in the Classroom and the Strategic Analysis Center,"Michael Bowman, Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu, Jerome Comello",2004/12/1,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA,"This paper presents a unique research and development project conducted over the past four years by the George Mason University GMU Learning Agents Center LAC and the US Army War College. This research synergistically integrates cutting edge artificial intelligence research, military strategy research, and the practical use of agents in strategic analysis and education in the context of Information Age Warfare and Network-Centric Operations. This research has produced a collaborative assistant for rapid knowledge formation RKF and reasoning, called Disciple-RKF. Disciple-RKF enables a team of subject matter experts who do not have prior knowledge engineering experience to rapidly build and use intelligent knowledge-based agents, with limited assistance from a knowledge engineer. Each subject matter expert teaches a personal Disciple-RKF agent while collaborating with it in solving specific problems. During this process, each Disciple-RKF agent learns from its expert and builds its knowledge base. These knowledge bases are then merged into an integrated knowledge base for Disciple-RKF. Disciple-RKF has been successfully applied to develop knowledge-based agents for military center of gravity analysis which have been used in the curriculum of the US Army War College.",
Mixed-Initiative Knowledge Base Development,Gheorghe Tecuci,2003/8/31,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA DEPT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE,"This research has developed an end-to-end mixed-initiative approach to the development of knowledge bases by subject matter experts, with limited assistance from knowledge engineers. In this approach, the complex knowledge engineering activities, traditionally performed by a knowledge engineer and a subject matter expert, are replaced with equivalent ones performed by the subject matter expert and a learning agent, through mixed-initiative reasoning, with limited assistance from the knowledge engineer. In essence, the learning agent helps the subject matter expert to describe a specific problem, to make explicit how he or she solves it, to formalize this reasoning and to explain it to the agent. At the same time, the expert helps the agent to understand this reasoning process, to learn general problem solving tasks and rules from it, and to refine its ontology, thus developing its knowledge base to represent the expertise of the subject matter expert. These methods have been implemented in the Disciple-RKF learning agent that has being successfully used in several courses at the US Army War College, in the context of the center of gravity analysis problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed methods simplify the acquisition of knowledge and improve the knowledge base development process.",

DISCIPLE integrates a learning system and an empty expert system, both using the same knowledge base. It is provided with an initial domain theory and learns problem solving rules from the problem solving steps received from its expert user, during interactive problem solving sessions. In this way, DISCIPLE evolves from a helpful assistant in problem solving to a genuine expert. The problem solving method of DISCIPLE combines problem reduction, problem solving by constraints, and problem solving by analogy. The learning method of DISCIPLE depends of its knowledge about the problem solving step (the example) from which it learns. In the context of a complete theory about the example, DISCIPLE uses explanation-based learning to improve its performance. In the context of a weak theory about the example, it synergistically combines explanation-based learning, learning by analogy, and empirical learning, developing its competence. In the context of an incomplete theory about the example, DISCIPLE learns by combining the above mentioned methods, improving both its competence and performance.",

A Machine Learning Based Methodology for Building Intelligent Agents,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Harry Keeling","This paper presents a machine learning based methodology for developing intelligent agents where an expert teaches the agent how to perform domain-specific tasks and the agent learns from the expert by employing complementary learning methods (such as inductive learning from examples, explanation-based learning, learning by analogy, learning by experimentation) in a dynamic, task-dependent way. This methodology has been successfully applied to develop an educational agent that generates history tests for students.","Scholar articles A Machine Learning Based Methodology for Building Intelligent AgentsG Tecuci, H KeelingRelated articles ","This paper presents a machine learning based methodology for developing intelligent agents where an expert teaches the agent how to perform domain-specific tasks and the agent learns from the expert by employing complementary learning methods (such as inductive learning from examples, explanation-based learning, learning by analogy, learning by experimentation) in a dynamic, task-dependent way.

Knowledge Acquisition and Learning by Experience-The Role of Case-Specific Knowledge,"G Tecuci, Y Kodratoff","As knowledge-based systems are addressing increasingly complex domains, their roles are shifting from classical expert systems to interactive assistants. To develop and maintain such systems, an integration of thorough knowledge acquisition procedures and sustained learning from experience is called for. A knowledge level modeling perspective has shown to be useful for analyzing the various types of knowledge related to a particular domain and set of tasks, and for constructing the models of knowledge contents needed in an intelligent system. To be able to meet the requirements of future systems with respect to robust competence and adaptive learning behavior, particularly in open and weak theory domains, a stronger emphasis should be put on the combined utilization of casespecific and general domain knowledge. In this chapter we present a framework for integrating KA and ML methods within a total knowledge modeling cycle, favoring an iterative rather than a top down approach to system development. Recent advances in the area of case-based reasoning provide a suitable basis. Focus is put on the knowledge maintenance part, for which a case-based method for learning from experience is described and exemplified by existing systems. Our own approach to integration of casespecific and general domain knowledge (the CREEK system) is briefly sketched, and used as a context for discussing case-based approaches to knowledge modeling in general.","Scholar articles Knowledge Acquisition and Learning by Experience-The Role of Case-Specific KnowledgeG Tecuci, Y KodratoffRelated articles All 7 versions ","As knowledge-based systems are addressing increasingly complex domains, their roles are shifting from classical expert systems to interactive assistants.

LEARNING GRADED CONCEPT DESCRIPTIONS BY INTEGRATING SYMBOLIC AND SUBSYMBOLIC STRATEGIES,"G Tecuci, Morgan Kaufmann","Concepts involved in real world applications usually possess graded sttuc tures. Instead of being equivalent. examples of a concept with a graded structure may be characterized by a degree of typicality in representing the concept. Both pure symbolic and subsymbolic representations are not adequate for describing concepts with graded structures. A pure symbolic representation fails to describe the graded structure of a concept. and a pure subsymbolic representation is unable to capture the central tendency of a concept. This chapter presents an integrated approacb that combines a symbolic approach with a subsymbolic one to learn concepts with graded structures. Concepts in this approacb are represented by a bybrid representation that is a combination of the symbolic and numeric representa tions.

"INPUT"" UNDERSTANDING"" AS A BASIS FOR MULTISTRQATEGY TASK-ADAPTIVE LEARNING","RS Michalski, G Tecuci","The paper explores several general issues in developing a multistrategy task-adaptive learning (MTL) system. The system aims at integrating a whole range of learning strategies, such as explanation-based learning, empirical generalization, abduction, constructive induction, learning by analogy and abstraction. The integration is dynamic, ie the way different strategies are evoked depends on the learning task at hand. The key idea of the learning method is that the learner tries to"" understand"" the input in terms of its current knowledge, and then uses this understanding to improve the knowledge. This process may involve both certain and plausible reasoning. The paper extends and generalizes the previous work on this topic.","Scholar articles INPUT"" UNDERSTANDING"" AS A BASIS FOR MULTISTRQATEGY TASK-ADAPTIVE LEARNINGRS Michalski, G TecuciRelated articles ","The paper explores several general issues in developing a multistrategy task-adaptive learning (MTL) system.
