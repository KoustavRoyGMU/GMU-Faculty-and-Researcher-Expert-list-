Total delay impact study: a comprehensive assessment of the costs and impacts of flight delay in the United States,"Michael Ball, Cynthia Barnhart, Martin Dresner, Mark Hansen, Kevin Neels, AR Odoni, Everett Peterson, Lance Sherry, Antonio Trani, Bo Zou",2010/10/1,"Publisher University of California, Berkeley. Institute of Transportation Studies","Flight delay is a serious and widespread problem in the United States. Increasing flight delays place a significant strain on the US air travel system and cost airlines, passengers, and society at many billions of dollars each year. While a number of previous studies have attempted to estimate the total economic impact of delays, scientific knowledge about the cost of delay is still limited. The Federal Aviation Administration sponsored the five NEXTOR universities and the Brattle Group to conduct a comprehensive study on the total delay impact (TDI) in the United States. This report analyzes a variety of cost components caused by flight delays, including cost to airlines, cost to passengers, cost of lost demand, as well as the indirect impact of delay on the US economy. This study offers a broader consideration of relevant costs than conventional cost-of-delay estimates, and employs several innovative methodologies for assessing the magnitudes of these costs. Of particular note are the passenger delay cost estimates, which recognize that flight cancellations and missed connections can lead to substantial passenger delays not revealed in traditional flight delay statistics.",285
Anomaly detection in aircraft data using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN),"Anvardh Nanduri, Lance Sherry",2016/4/19,Conference 2016 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance (ICNS),"Anomaly Detection in multivariate, time-series data collected from aircraft's Flight Data Recorder (FDR) or Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) data provide a powerful means for identifying events and trends that reduce safety margins.

In contrast, Machine Learning algorithms detect unknown unusual patterns in the data either through semi-supervised or unsupervised learning. The Multiple Kernel Anomaly Detection (MKAD) algorithm based on One-class SVM identified 6 of 11 canonical anomalies in a large dataset but is limited by the need for dimensionality reduction, poor sensitivity to short term anomalies, and inability to detect anomalies in latent features.

Accuracy of reinforcement learning algorithms for predicting aircraft taxi-out times: A case-study of Tampa Bay departures,"Poornima Balakrishna, Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry",2010/12/1,Journal Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,"Taxi-out delay is a significant portion of the block time of a flight. Uncertainty in taxi-out times reduces predictability of arrival times at the destination. This in turn results in inefficient use of airline resources such as aircraft, crew, and ground personnel. Taxi-out time prediction is also a first step in enabling schedule modifications that would help mitigate congestion and reduce emissions. The dynamically changing operation at the airport makes it difficult to accurately predict taxi-out time. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of taxi out time prediction using a nonparametric reinforcement learning (RL) based method, set in the probabilistic framework of stochastic dynamic programming. A case-study of Tampa International Airport (TPA) shows that on an average, with 93.7% probability, on any given day, our predicted mean taxi-out time for any given quarter, matches the actual mean taxi-out time for the same …",116

Display of altitude and path capture trajectories,"Lance C Sherry, Steven T Quarry",2005/3/22,Patent office US,"Pilot error is reduced and auto pilot operation is improved by the addition of capture information to the information provided on a cockpit display. The capture information, such as, for example, capture start point, last point to initiate capture, trajectory during capture, and capture overshoot region provide information to the pilot regarding the correct initiation of capture. Pilots are therefore better able to evaluate the ongoing performance of the automation or auto pilot systems and to trust that the auto pilot is functioning as desired. Furthermore, the pilot operating the aircraft in manual mode receives guidance based on this information to better know when to initiate capture of the assigned altitude or vertical path.",82

Multifactor model for predicting delays at US airports,"Ning Xu, Lance Sherry, Kathryn Blackmond Laskey",2008/1,Journal Transportation Research Record,"Traffic flow management (TFM), in coordination with airline operation centers, manages the arrival and departure flow of aircraft at the nation's airports on the basis of airport arrival and departure rates for each 15-min segment throughout the day. The management of traffic flow has become so efficient in the United States that approximately 95% of delays now occur at the airports (not while airborne). Inefficiencies in traffic flow occur when nontraffic flow delays (e.g., carrier, turnaround, aircraft swapping, and local weather delays) are superimposed on the traffic flow delays. Researchers have correlated these nontraffic flow delays at airports with sets of causal factors and have created models to predict aggregate delays at airports on the time scale of a day. To be consistent with the way traffic flow is managed, a model of causal factors of delays in 15-min increments would provide the basis for improving the efficiency …",59

During this research, the influence of the stochastic arrival process on the turnaround process is captured by modeling stochastically all elements of the turnaround as part of a Ground Manager (GMAN). Since arrival delay is one major factor influencing turnaround time process duration and variance, and delay occurs in larger amplitudes at US airports compared to European ones due the absence of slot control, the presented GMAN concept is tested with arrival delay data from the US NAS (National Airspace System). The arrival delay is collected from ASPM (Aviation System Performance Metrics) and custom probability distributions were fitted on the data for different airport categories. The results obtained from this analysis by showing the proof of concept of the GMAN, are discussed in this paper",45
Estimating taxi-out times with a reinforcement learning algorithm,"Poornima Balakrishna, Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry, Benjamin S Levy",2008/10/26,Conference 2008 IEEE/AIAA 27th Digital Avionics Systems Conference,"Flight delays have a significant impact on the nationpsilas economy.

One can think of this network as analogous to the system of interstate highways with passing lanes, breakdown areas, on-ramps and off-ramps, all designed to quickly move as much traffic as possible. This network would maximize the airspace throughput by more efficiently transporting aircraft, into and out of the congested airports. We apply visualization techniques to classify the current air traffic into different layers based on the demand profiles and route structure between origin and destination (OD) pairs. We also model the air traffic as flow of a fluid, where aircraft are the particles of the fluid.

Airport taxi-out prediction using approximate dynamic programming: intelligence-based paradigm,"Poornima Balakrishna, Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry",2008/1,Journal Transportation research record,"Flight delay is one of the pressing problems that have far-reaching effects on society and the nation's economy. A primary cause of flight delay in the National Airspace System is high taxi-out times (time between gate push-back and wheels-off) at major airports. Accurate prediction of taxi-out time is needed to make downstream schedule adjustments and for better departure planning, which could mitigate delays, emissions, and congestion on the ground. However, accurate prediction of taxi-out time is difficult because of uncertainties associated with the dynamically changing airport operation. A novel stochastic approximation scheme based on reinforcement learning (RL) is presented for predicting taxi-out times in the presence of weather and other departure-related uncertainties.

Air travel consumer protection: metric for passenger on-time performance,"Lance Sherry, Danyi Wang, George Donohue",2007,Journal Transportation Research Record,"The raison d'être for the national air transportation system (ATS) is the movement of passengers and cargo.

Regulatory consumer information available to airline passengers provides measures of trip performance by using the percentage of on-time flights or on-time percentage (OTP) (e.g., 15-OTP metric). Researchers have shown that these flight-based metrics are poor proxies for passenger trip time performance. First, these metrics do not include the trip delays accrued by passengers rebooked because of canceled flights (which account for 40% of the overall passenger trip delays). Second, the metrics do not quantify the magnitude of the delay (only the likelihood) and thus fail to provide the consumer with a useful assessment of the impact of a delay (such as missed connections on next …",31

Analysis of air transportation for the new york metroplex: Summer 2007,"Liya Wang, George Donohue, Karla Hoffman, Lance Sherry, Rosa Oseguera-Lohr",2008/6,Journal International Conference on Research in Air Transportation (ICRAT 2008),"The New York metroplex airports (JFK, LGA, EWR) provide air transportation service to this critical international economic hub. In the summer of 2007 the flights servicing the NYC metroplex airports experienced excessive delays and cancellations that added significant costs to doing business in New York. These delays can be attributed to changes in daily airport capacity (due to weather) and to airline practices, in accordance with regulations, of scheduling in excess of airport capacity. Previous research has demonstrated that maintaining airline seat capacity by increasing aircraft size and reducing frequency is an economically efficient and feasible solution. This paper analyzes the characteristics of the air transportation service to the New York metroplex airports. The metroplex has service to 109 domestic airports. Thirty six percent of airports serve all three New York airports, while 35% serve two of the airports.

A decision framework for prioritizing industrial materials research and development,"Richard S Silberglitt, Lance Sherry",2002,Issue 1558,"Federal research and development (R & D) sponsors, managers, and other decisionmakers are faced with increasingly difficult choices on how to allocate shrinking resources among various R & D programs.

In particular, they examine the challenges the OIT's Industrial Materials for the Future program faces in allocating resources to maximize the reduction of energy use and waste production in nine energy-and waste-intensive US industries. In response to these challenges, RAND developed a decision framework to prioritize multiple R & D activities. The framework uses quantitative estimates of anticipated benefits, the potential of industrial materials to achieve certain properties, and the probability of success of an R & D project to compute an expected value for R & D in a manner that is logical, auditable, and straightforward.

Improving the nowcast of unstable approaches,"Lance Sherry, John Shortle",2016,Journal 8th International Conference on Research in Air Transportation,"The approach and landing is a complex phase of flight, in which flight crews need to conduct a series of procedures in a condensed time frame to make the approach stable. Unstable approaches can lead to events with reduced safety margins and additional operating cost. To ensure flights have stable approaches, airlines have established stabilized approach criteria to make sure the landing flight is on track, within appropriate range of speed and rate of descent. If the criteria are not satisfied at stabilization altitudes, a go-around must be executed. Nowcasting the likelihood of unstable approaches before reaching the stabilization altitudes may assist flight crews in taking actions to correct the flight trajectory to avoid a potential unstable approach. A previous study shows the feasibility of detecting unstable approaches using historical trajectory data and the feasibility of nowcasting unstable approaches using state variables. This paper describes improvements in the nowcast performance through the modification of existing features and the addition of more features. For the Nowcast at 6 nm for unstable approaches after reaching 1000’AGL, the accuracy was improved from 71.3% to 74.8%, the recall was improved from 60.8% to 64.7%, and the precision was improved from 74.0% to 78.4%.

Current instrument flight rule (IFR) standards provide fixed separation minima for given pairs of wake vortex weight classes of aircraft.

Primer on aircraft induced clouds and their global warming mitigation options,"Lance Sherry, Terrence Thompson",2020/11,Journal Transportation Research Record,"Pressure is increasing on all industrial sectors to address climate sustainability, not only for the welfare of the planet, but also to preserve the customer base and manage operating costs. The aviation industry has a unique opportunity to halve its global radiative forcing (RF) contribution by minimizing the generation of aircraft induced clouds (AIC). These anthropogenic (human-made) condensation trails create a greenhouse effect by absorbing or directing back to Earth approximately 33% of emitted outgoing thermal longwave radiation. The effect of AIC accounts for 2% of the Earth's total anthropogenic RF. The effect of reducing AIC on global warming is immediate (unlike CO2 emissions which have a 2-decade delay in affecting global warming).",7

Available operational time window: A method for evaluating and monitoring airline procedures,"Houda Kerkoub Kourdali, Lance Sherry",2017/12,Journal Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making,"Time is a widely accepted means for evaluation of procedures used in the management and control of complex, dynamic systems, such as airliners. Time provides a common unit of measurement of operator performance in the context of the task in both naturalistic and experimental conditions. Time is also correlated with errors, operational efficiency, and task loading. Analytical and simulation methods used for the design and evaluation of procedures require information on the allowable operational time window (AOTW). For complex, dynamic systems, such as airliners, the AOTW exhibits a high degree of variance. The statistical properties of the AOTW have not been readily available to designers.

These accidents involved structurally and mechanically sound aircraft decelerating through the 1.3 VStall buffer to the stall airspeed-ie a Controlled Flight into Stall (CFIS). The analysis produced three main observations: First, the accidents were “functional complexity” failures--the result of a complex sequence of behaviors of the automation functions. There were no consistent: failures that triggered the events (eg sensor failures), effects of triggering events on the automation (eg mode change), or commands issued by the automation (eg thrust setting). Second, the pilots were unable to intervene effectively due to the absence on the flight deck of relevant information and salient cues to monitor these rare events or their effects. Third, there was no single intervention that could mitigate all of these accidents. Implications for flight deck procedures, training and automation design are discussed.",7
Analysis of airport surface operations: a case-study of Atlanta Hartfield airport,"Saba Neyshabouri, Lance Sherry",2014/1,"Journal Proceedings of the Transportation Research Board 93rd Annual Meeting, Washington, DC, USA","Over the last two decades the successes of Traffic Flow Management (TFM) initiatives have successfully decreased the airborne delay for the flights in the National Airspace System (NAS). The next opportunity for efficiency improvement is airport surface operations. Research on surface operations has focused on methods of analysis and metrics using time-stamped event data and surface track data to quantify performance of “normal” operations. This paper describes a method using time-stamped event data to quantify and diagnose “irregular” surface operations (ie surface counts in excess of two standard deviations from the mean worst-case surface count). An analysis of surface operations at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL) airport for 2012 identified an average surface count of 25 active flights, with an average daily maximum surface count of 67. The daily maximum surface count ranged from 46 to 124 active flights. On 18 days the daily maximum surface count exceeded 2 standard deviations from the average (ie 2= 86 flights). Fifteen of these days occurred between May and August. There are multiple patterns in the surface counts in excess of 2:(i) reduced airport departure rates coupled with arrivals being delayed by a ground delay program (ii) changes in runway configuration,(iii) fluctuating arrival capacity (iv) high early arrival count with no or minimal capacity reduction (ie “blue sky days”). The high surface counts in 9 of the 18 days were compounded by interaction between arrivals and departures.

Passenger trip delays statistics for 2010,Lance Sherry,2012,Source Transportation Research Board 91st Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"The raison d'etre of the Airline Passenger Transportation System (APTS) is the rapid, affordable, and safe transportation of passengers (and cargo). The top-level performance measure of the system is passenger trip delay, defined as the difference between ticketed passenger arrival time and actual passenger arrival time. Passenger trip delay accounts for delays caused by cancelled flights, missed connections and diversions, as well as delayed flights. Algorithms developed to estimate passenger itineraries and passenger trip delay statistics using publicly available data were used to generate passenger trip delay statistics for 2010. In 2010 an estimated 421 million passengers ticketed on 46.8 million itineraries were transported on 8.7 million flights. Passenger on-time performance was 78.7%. The average delay for a disrupted passenger was 67 minutes. The total trip delay experienced by passengers in 2010 was 11,669 years. The largest contributors to total passenger trip delays were: passengers on direct itineraries disrupted by delayed flights-32%, passengers on connecting itineraries disrupted by cancelled flights-23%, connecting itineraries disrupted by delayed flights-16%, and missed connections-14%. Since 2007, annual passenger trip delay is down 26%, however in 2010 1-in-5 passengers experienced a trip disruption (compared to 1-in-4 in 2007) with an average delay for disrupted passengers of 67 minutes (73 minutes in 2007).

Benefits analysis of RNP approach procedure to runway 13C at Midway airport,"Akshay Belle, Lance Sherry",2014/4/8,"Conference 2014 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS) Conference Proceedings","Advances in aircraft navigation technology (i.e. Performance Based Navigation) have enabled the implementation of precise curved path approaches (i.e., RNP 0.3 w/ RF leg approach procedure) in the terminal airspace which improve flight efficiency and allows safe navigation near high terrain obstacles and airspace occupied by other flows of air traffic. However, the adoption of these technologies by airlines has been slow and haphazard due to uncertainties in the estimates of the benefits of these new approach procedures.

Adaptive Control of Multistage Airport Departure Planning Process using Approximate Dynamic Programming,"Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry",2007/2/15,"Journal Washington DC: George Mason University, Working Paper","Many service enterprise systems such as the airport departure systems are typical multistage multivariable systems with non-linear complex interactions between stages. These systems function over a wide range of operating conditions and are subject to random disturbances, which further enhance the non-linear characteristics. Also, there are many uncertain factors which often makes it is difficult to describe the process dynamics with complete information and accurate physical and empirical models. Adaptive controllers based on the analytical and/or artificial intelligence techniques can provide improved dynamic performance of the multistage process by allowing the parameters of the controller to adjust as the operating conditions change, and are known to operate in model free environment. One such example of an adaptive controller, is the combination of analytical dynamic programming methods and artificial intelligence techniques to achieve superior control of operations and improved quality of finished products. This new branch of research has become known as Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) methods. This paper first presents a state-of-the-art review including the advantages and limitations of ADP methods. Next, it develops a novel multiresolution assisted reinforcement learning controller (MARLC) based on ADP principles, which is used in an agent-based control model for improving the performance quality of the multistage airport departure planning process.

Survey of Rationales and Methods for Determining Declared Airport Capacity,"Phil Railsback, Lance Sherry",2006,Source Transportation Research Board 85th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"Airport congestion has been and continues to be a challenge to aviation policymakers. At congested airports it is necessary to implement congestion management techniques, such as High Density Rules, other forms of administrative slot allocation, or market-based methods. Common to all congestion management techniques is the question of declared capacity–how many operations per hour (slots) to authorize. Declared capacity constrains how many operations may be scheduled at an airport, and is therefore a policy control that affects the tradeoff between throughput of operations, delay, and schedule predictability. This paper examines the literature to identify and summarize engineering-based methods for setting declared capacity, alternate definitions of capacity, alternate representations of capacity, alternate rationales (bases) for setting declared capacity, and tools that support selection of declared capacity. Capacity is recognized as a time-dependent stochastic process that requires time-dependent stochastic representations and models for analysis. The literature suggests that dominant methods for setting declared capacity rely on subjective judgment and often use limited models. A method based on maximizing economic value has only been proposed in the literature, but would provide the only identified objective, transparent, and reproducible basis for declared capacity.",3

Analysis of flight performance data for 35 OEP airports for the summer of 2007 identifies that:(i) Significant gate-hold delays, in which more than 30% of arriving aircraft are delayed, occurred at 11 of the OEP-35 airports,(ii) major gate-hold delays are rare events (eg, once a month at ATL),(iii) on days when there is a major gate hold, large delays are experienced by all major carriers at the airport,(iv) the primary causes of gate-hold delays are increased turnaround times and/or disrupted arrival/departure banks. The methodology for analysis, the results, and the implications of these results are discussed.",2
Why Equity Is so Elusive: Dynamical Properties of Overscheduled National Airspace System Resources,"Lance Sherry, John Shortle, Vivek Kumar",2009/1/1,"Book 9th AIAA Aviation Technology, Integration, and Operations Conference (ATIO) and Aircraft Noise and Emissions Reduction Symposium (ANERS)","One of the major issues in the design of the concepts-of-operations for NEXTGEN is the equitable allocation of overscheduled National Airspace System (NAS) resources.

Accuracy of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Predicting Aircraft Taxi-out Times,"Poornima Balakrishna, Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry",2008,Journal Proceedings of the ICRAT,"Taxi-out delay is a significant portion of the block time of a flight. Uncertainty in taxi-out times reduces predictability of arrival times at the destination. This in turn results in inefficient use of airline resources such as aircraft, crew, and ground personnel. Taxi-out time prediction is also a first step in enabling schedule modifications that would help mitigate congestion and reduce emissions. The dynamically changing operation at the airport makes it difficult to accurately predict taxi-out time. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of taxi out time prediction using a nonparametric reinforcement learning (RL) based method, set in the probabilistic framework of stochastic dynamic programming. A casestudy of Tampa International Airport (TPA) shows that on an average, with 93.7% probability, on any given day, our predicted mean taxi-out time for any given quarter, matches the actual mean taxi-out time for the same quarter …",2
Performance of the Air Transportation System for the Atlanta-Chicago-O'Hare Route,"David Schaar, Lance Sherry",2006/10/15,Conference 2006 ieee/aiaa 25TH Digital Avionics Systems Conference,"The goal of the air transportation system is to provide reliable, affordable, rapid transportation of people and goods.

As a consequence, the overall speed of and reliability of this mode of transportation is determined by the collective interaction between these agents and the impact of uncertainty in the system. This paper describes a methodology and the results of an analysis of the degree of uncertainty in trip time reliability on a single congested-hub to congested-hub route (Atlanta - Chicago O'Hare).

The nature of the FMS has also caused great difficulties learning and accessing this functionality. This study examines actual Air Force pilots who were qualified on the newly introduced advanced FMS and shows that the design of the system itself is a primary source of difficulty learning the system. Twenty representative tasks were selected which the pilots could be expected to accomplish on an ' actual flight. These tasks were analyzed using the RAFIV stage model (Sherry, Polson, et al. 2002). This analysis demonstrates that a great burden is placed on remembering complex reformulation of the task to function mapping. 65% of the tasks required retaining one access steps in memory to accomplish the task, 20% required two memorized access steps, and 15% required zero memorized access steps. The probability that a participant would make an access error on the tasks was: two memorized access steps - 74%, one memorized access step - 13%, and zero memorized access steps - 6%. Other factors were analyzed as well, including experience with the system and frequency of use. This completed the picture of a system with many memorized steps causing difficulty with the new system, especially when trying to fine where to access the correct function.",2

Confronting Functional Complexity Failures: The Case of a Runway Excursion in Munich,"Robert Mauro, Lance Sherry",2019/11,Journal Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting,"Complex systems often produce unanticipated emergent behavior as a result of the interactions between behaviorally complex sub-systems or agents. The sub-systems may be human or artificial. They may be co-located or geographically distributed and operate autonomously. Although the individual sub-systems may be tested and certified for high levels of reliability (e.g. 10-7), interactions between the sub-systems may occur so that emergent behaviors allow the system to migrate into an unsafe operating region. This may occur even when all of the sub-systems are behaving nominally and no equipment has failed. This phenomenon is called a “functional complexity failure.” In this paper, we present an analysis of a functional complexity failure that resulted in a runway excursion and discuss the options for detecting and mitigating the conditions for these “normal accidents” before the accident occurs.",1

Comparison of efficiency of slot allocation by congestion pricing and ration by schedule,"Saba Neyshabouri, Vivek Kumar, Lance Sherry, Karla Hoffman",2012/4/24,"Conference 2012 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference","When airport arrival slots are scheduled in excess of the available capacity, the scheduled flights are assigned slots by a rationing scheme.

For these benefits to be realized, though, it is critical to analyze and understand the ways in which pilots interact with the system and the ways in which the changes in communication style affect a pilot’s awareness of their environment.

Researchers have documented actions by users of the National Airspace System (NAS) to advantageously position a flight for a preferential slot allocation through the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) allocation used by Air Traffic Control (ATC). NextGen concepts-of-operations (eg 4-D trajectories) will provide alternative mechanisms for users position flights for advantageous slot allocation. Will this degrade or enhance system performance and equity? This paper describes an analysis of the impact of users positioning flights for advantageous slot allocation on system performance and equity for an arrival flow to a metering fix. The results indicate that the combinatorics of all possible FCFS allocations create a range of performance and equity. Analysis demonstrates that user positioning for advantageous slot allocation under FCFS represents a subset of the possible combinations of FCFS slot allocations and does not result in degraded performance or equity. A casestudy analysis of an arrival flow for La Guardia demonstrates that system performance and equity are robust to user positioning for advantageous FCFS slot allocation.

Potential for Using Deep Learning for Digital-Twin System Validation Testing,"Lance Sherry, Shamshad Ansari, James Baldo, Brett Berlin, John Shortle, Ali Raz",2022/9/18,Conference 2022 IEEE/AIAA 41st Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),"One of the challenges in designing and operating systems composed of interacting components is validating that the emergent behavior of the system does not cause one or more components to migrate, over time, into a hazardous operating state. Many modern airline accidents can be characterized as Interaction Accidents – no component failed, but the interaction of components resulted in a hazardous state.Due to the dependence of time, emergent behavior cannot be evaluated by analysis of the design. In theory it can be evaluated by Digital-Twin agent-based simulations. However, the running these simulations to uncover rare event emergent hazardous states is prohibitive due to: (1) the combinatorics of initial states of each of the components, and the (2) combinatorics of the time dimension (i.e. small variations in timing can result in very different outcomes).

Methodology and Case Study for Validation of Aircraft-Induced Clouds from Hyperspectral Imagery,"Amy Tal Rose, Lance Sherry, Donglian Sun",2022/8/8,Journal Atmosphere,"Aircraft-Induced Clouds (AICs), colloquially called contrails, form from the emission of soot from jet engines during cruise flight in favorable atmospheric conditions. AICs absorb, scatter, and reflect shortwave and longwave radiation. This radiative transfer has a cooling effect during the day; however, the night experiences an overwhelming warming effect, which leads to an overall warming effect on Earth, contributing to anthropogenically propelled climate change. Reducing AICs significantly mitigates aviation’s contribution to climate change by reducing the disruption in Earth’s radiation budget. Researchers have proposed AIC Abatement Programs (AAPs) to increase cruise flight levels without additional fuel burn. In order to effectively implement AAPs, it is crucial to be able to accurately identify AICs from publicly available aerial and satellite imagery. This study aims at the identification of AICs from hyperspectral imagery to help the effective implementation of an AAP and to mitigate climate change. This paper describes a method for the hyperspectral analysis of aerial images in order to accurately identify AICs through a case study based in West Virginia. The results show that both the Adaptive Coherence Estimator and the Matched Filter algorithms based on unique in-scene spectra were successful in the isolation of the AICs from other cloud types and the background. It is found that AICs can be identified with 84% confidence in this case study. The method, a case study, and future works are provided.",

Alert! The Appearance of Moded Input Devices in the Modern Airliner Cockpit,"Lance Sherry, Robert Mauro, Oleksandra Donnelly",2022/2/17,Journal IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,"The automation in the flight deck of a modern airliner has grown in functionality over the past several decades, improving safety and operational efficiency. As the sophistication of automation has increased, some traditional input devices in the cockpit, such as throttle levers, yokes, and switches, have unobtrusively changed the way they work. Instead of operating the same way at all times, the behavior of these input devices has become context-sensitive (i.e., “moded”). It is well known in human factors design that nonsalient moded input devices require increased cognitive workload and can result in a startle, surprise, and confusion. An analysis of modern airliner cockpits identified three types of moded input devices: 1) disabled, 2) alternative behavior, and 3) command override.

Multi-objective Evaluation of Various Target Separation Standards for Flow Corridor Based on TOPSIS and Entropy,"Bojia Ye, Zhao Yang, John F Shortle, Lance Sherry",2017,Source Transportation Research Board 96th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"This study presents a procedure for evaluating various target separation standards for a parallel-lane flow corridor considering multiple performance measures, including air traffic operations, corridor capacity, safety and environmental impacts. Simulation models were established using the User Manual for the Base of Aircraft Data published by EUROCONTROL. A self-separation flow corridor segment simulation model with two parallel lanes were used to evaluate the operational and environmental impacts of various target separation standards for consecutive aircraft in the flow corridor. For a particular target separation standard, the operational impact was measured using the total control delay to the aircraft in the corridor. The corridor capacity was calculated as the average aircraft throughput per hour. The safety impact was measured using the corridor breakout rate. The aircraft CO₂ emissions were considered as the environmental impact measurement. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) entropy evaluation method was then used to rank the performances of various target separations considering multiple performance measures. It was found that combining multiple objectives in decision making one may obtain different results with regard to the optimum target separation standard.

A Robust Method for Universal Beacon Code Assignment,"Vivek Kumar, Lance Sherry, Richard Jehlen",2012/10,Journal Air Traffic Control Quarterly,"This paper describes a method for assignment of beacon codes for secondary surveillance that eliminates the need for code reassignments. The method, Space-Time Adjacency algorithm, assigns unique codes to flights by exploiting the temporal and spatial opportunities in individual flight plans. In simulations of 2007 National Airspace System traffic using this method no reassignments were required. The method is robust for peak day operations in all seasons in the presence of temporal and spatial variations in flight plans. As a result, controller and pilot workload can be reduced, while increasing safety margins.",

Flight plan routes are selected by airlines to optimize their operations (e.g. minimize crew time, fuel burn and delays). In the absence of coordination of 4-D flight plan route selection, flights can converge at the intersection of the flight plan routes, creating delays and fluctuations in A ir Traffic Control (ATC) workload. Furthermore, due to the high degrees of freedom available in flight plan route selection and the varying constraints in the NAS, flight plan route selection can contribute to the stochasticity of the NAS.

When an arriving flight lands on a runway, it is possible that it cannot pull into its gate due to gate unavailability. We define this phenomenon as gate-waiting delay. This paper gives a functional analysis of gate-waiting delays at New York Laguardia airport (LGA) for 92 days in the summer of 2007. We find that daily delays are typically not problematic (less than 600 minutes in 80 days). However, in the worst days, delays can be extremely large (1200 to 2400 minutes in the worst 4 days when worst 6 delayed flights are delayed for almost 3 hours in average). In the 12 worst days, there are 9 days in which delays can be attributed to a higher gate demand than the number of existing gates. On 8 of these days, this is due to compressed arrivals. On one day, this is due to increased gate-occupancy times. Delay mitigation strategies are also discussed.","Airport gates are one of the congestion points of the air transportation system.

Approach to Reducing Airline Fuel Consumption Through Ground Delay Program,"Lance Sherry, Bengi Manley, Terry Thompson",2009,Source Transportation Research Board 88th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"The discrepancy between the demand for arrival slots at an airport, and the available arrival slots on a given day, is resolved by the Ground Delay Program (GDP). The scope of the GDP determines the number of flights and the type of aircraft that are issued delays prior to departure. As the GDP scope decreases, the number of aircraft affected by the GDP decreases, the average delay per aircraft increases, and the average rate of fuel-burn per aircraft decreases. Depending on how much additional pre-departure delay is assigned to each flight, reduced GDP scope can result in reduced total fuel consumption during the GDP. This paper examines the impact of exploiting the asymmetry between increasing flight delays and decreasing pre-departure fuel-burn rates (as the scope of the GDP decreases) to reduce total fuel consumption during a GDP. Analysis of the fuel savings for 517 GDPs at the three New York Metroplex airports in 2007 identified a 9%(1.95 million kg) reduction in fuel used for ramp-parking pre-departure delays during the GDPs with reduced scope. At $7 per gallon, this is equivalent to a fuel savings of $4.2 M per year. The implications of reduced scope on equity and the limitations of this analysis are discussed.",

As airport stakeholders are designing new airport infrastructures and proposing advanced systems and procedures for improving ground operations, an inexpensive tool is needed to evaluate any proposed changes. Thus, simulation tools become essential to validate their choices before operational use. Many modeling tools have been developed over the years, but there is still much room for improvement. This study describes an open, portable, user friendly modeling tool, GreenSim, developed at the George Mason University (GMU) Center for Air Transportation System Research (CATSR). It has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which allows the user to choose the desired airport to simulate and to define characteristics of airport components, including starting and ending dates that define the arrival and departure schedules and the service times of each segment. To correctly simulate and model all types of airports, GreenSim integrates three functions: 1) data analysis, 2) simulation modeling, and 3) airport performance analysis for delays, fuel, emissions, and operating cost. The paper has validated GreenSim modeling ability with three types of airports considering delays and demand size, and the confidence interval given by GreenSim can cover all real random data sample points from Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) database. Therefore, the paper believes that GreenSim can help airport stakeholders to test what-if scenarios to investigate the impact of new technologies and ATM concepts.",

The High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT), scheduled to be operated after 2010, will have unprecedented levels of automation. Designers of the HSCT will be required to address the growing phenomenon of “automation surprises” that affects the current generation of commercial aircraft. An automation surprise is a mismatch between the operator’s mental model of the behavior of the automation, and the actual behavior of the automation. Misunderstanding the intentions and actions of the automation leads to an increase in operator workload and improper use of the automation. Researchers have attributed automation surprises to discrepancies and approximations in pilot’s conceptual models of the behavior of the avionics that are derived from cockpit displays and training manuals.This report describes an analysis of the behavioral characteristics of software in the modern cockpit. Study results indicate that the behavior of modern avionics includes significant logical decision-making, as well as algebra or data manipulation. The implications of this result are modifications to traditional cockpit displays, designed to provide models of algebraic closed-loop control, to take into account the decisionmaking characteristic of the underlying software. Furthermore, techniques for organizing training material, and modeling languages used in software development CASE tools should also reflect the decision-making characteristic.","Over the last twenty years, the amount of software onboard commercial aircraft has doubled every four years.

These ""automation surprises"" have been attributed to differences between the pilot's model of the behavior of the avionics and the actual behavior encoded in the avionics software. A formal technique is described for the analysis and measurement of the behavior of the cruise pitch modes of a modern Autopilot. The analysis characterizes the behavior of the Autopilot as situation-action rules. The behavior of the cruise pitch mode logic for a contemporary modern Autopilot was found to include 177 rules, including Level Change (23), Vertical Speed (16), Altitude Capture (50), and Altitude Hold (88). These rules are determined based on the values of 62 inputs. Analysis of the rule-based model also shed light on the factors cited in the literature as contributors to ""automation surprises.""",

The study proposes a framework to provide accurate and complete information in an attempt to eliminate confusion about 'what the system is doing'. This study will examine a structured methodology for organizing the ideas on which the system was designed, communicating this information through the training material, and displaying it in the airplane. Previous research on model-based, computer aided instructional technology has shown reductions in the amount of time to a specified level of competence. The lessons learned from the development of these technologies are well suited for use with the design methodology which was used to develop the vertical guidance logic for a large commercial air transport. The design methodology presents the model from which to derive the training material, and the content of information to be displayed to the operator. The study consists of a 2 X 2 factorial experiment which will compare a new method of training vertical guidance logic and a new type of display. The format of the material used to derive both the training and the display will be provided by the Operational Procedure Methodology.

The training model is based on a formalism, the operational procedure model, that represents the mission model, the rules, and the functions of a modem avionics system. This formalism has been defined such that it can be understood and shared by pilots, the avionics software, and design engineers. Each element of the software is defined in terms of its intent (What?), the rationale (Why?), and the resulting behavior (How?). The Advanced Computer Tutoring project at Carnegie Mellon University has developed a type of model-based, computer aided instructional technology called cognitive tutors. They summarize numerous studies showing that training times to a specified level of competence can be achieved in one third the time of conventional class room instruction.

The model underlying the instructional program and that simulates the effects of pilots entries and the behavior of the avionics is based on the operational procedure model. Pilots are given a series of vertical flightpath management problems. Entries that result in violations, such as failure to make a crossing restriction or violating the speed limits, result in error messages with instruction.

The Role of Moded Input Devices in Modern Airliner Accidents,"Lance Sherry, Robert Mauro, Oleksandra Donnelly","The automation in the flighdeck of a modern airliner has grown in functionality over the last several decades, improving safety, and operational efficiency. As the sophistication of the automation has increased, some traditional input devices in the flightdeck, such as throttle levers, yokes, and switches, have unobtrusively changed the way they work. Instead of operating the same way at all times, the behavior of these input devices have become context-sensitive (ie,“moded”). In many cases, the change in context is subtle and is not salient to the flight crew, leading the flight crew to use the input device expecting one behavior but experiencing another. This paper documents the role these “moded” input devices have played in airline accidents in inhibiting or slowing the flight crew intervention in the sequence of events leading up to the accident event. The implications of these results on flightdeck design, certification, and flight crew training are discussed.","Scholar articles The Role of Moded Input Devices in Modern Airliner AccidentsL Sherry, R Mauro, O DonnellyRelated articles ","The automation in the flighdeck of a modern airliner has grown in functionality over the last several decades, improving safety, and operational efficiency.

Taxi-out Prediction using Approximate Dynamic Programming,"Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry","High taxi-out times (time between gate push-back and wheels off) at major airports is a primary cause for flight delays in the National Airspace System (NAS). These delays have a cascading effect and affect the performance of Air Traffic Control (ATC) System. Accurate prediction of taxi-out time is needed to make downstream schedule adjustments and better departure planning, which mitigates delays, emissions, and congestions on the ground. However, the accurate prediction of taxi-out time is difficult due to the uncertainties associated with them. The primary objective of this paper is to accurately predict taxi-out time at major airports, in the presence of weather and other departure-related uncertainties. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based stochastic approximation scheme for predicting taxi-out times. The prediction problem is cast in a probabilistic framework of stochastic dynamic programming and solved using approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approaches. The strengths of the method is that is it non-parametric unlike the regression models with fixed parameters, highly adaptable to the dynamic airport environment since its learning based, is scalable, is inexpensive since it does not need highly sophisticated surface management system, and effectively handles uncertainties due to the probabilistic framework.

COMPARISON OF FLIGHT DELAYS AND PASSENGER TRIP DELAYS IN THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM (NAS),"Lance Sherry, George Donohue","The primary objective of the National Airspace System (NAS) is the transportation of passengers and cargo. It is no surprise, therefore, that passenger trip time performance is positively correlated with passenger satisfaction, airfare elasticity, and airline profits. Regulatory consumer information available to airline passengers provides measures of trip performance using only flight data (and not passenger trip data). Previously, researchers, using a small set of proprietary airline data, demonstrated that trip delays experienced by passengers due to missed connections, cancelled flights, and delayed flights are not negligible. Further they showed that flight delay data cannot be used as a proxy for passenger trip delays. This paper describes a comparative statistical analysis between flight delay data and passenger trip delay data for one year’s worth of flights on the 1030 single segment routes between the OEP-35 airports. The passenger trip data is derived from publicly available data-bases and accounts for delays experienced by passengers on single segment routes due to cancelled flights as well as delayed flights. The statistical analysis indicates that:(i) the percentage of on-time flights is statistically equivalent to the percentage of on-time passengers,(ii) the average passenger trip delay is 34 minutes in excess of the average flight delay, and (iii) average passenger trip delay for the worst 5% of delayed passengers is 150 minutes in excess of the flight delay.

"Dynamic Storyboards: Faster, Cheaper Software Prototypes for Usability Evaluation","Michael Feary, Lance Sherry","Modern engineering design processes often validate user-device interaction via paper-based validations or a software prototype of the product. Paper-based evaluations, such as storyboards and walkthroughs, produce relatively quick and inexpensive evaluations, but they provide a limited view of user interaction. In contrast, traditional software prototypes which allow demonstration of a properly working device in software form provide a means to validate the product design over a significantly larger subset of the user-device interaction space than static storyboards. However, software prototypes can be expensive and time intensive to build, resulting in greater inertia to overcome to effect design changes.In response to an industry request, an approach was taken to remedy this problem in the form of a new type of software application for user-interface evaluation. This paper describes the new software application that combines the speed of static storyboard development with the increased interaction and range of activities offered by a traditional software prototype referred to as a Dynamic Storyboard.

NAS-wide Simulation and Passenger Itinerary Performance,Lance Sherry,"NAS-wide simulations are one of the methods used to estimate annual system-wide benefits for Air Traffic Control modernization concepts-of-operations and technologies (eg NextGen/SESAR). These tools simulate the operation of up to 60,000 flights per day in various combinations of demand (ie flights) and capacity (ie airport and airspace capacity). The main input to the simulation is a schedule of flights (not a schedule of passenger itineraries). As a result, estimates of passenger delays assume all passengers are on direct itineraries only, and the impact of cancelled flights, missed connection, and airline network effects are not considered.This paper describes the results of an aggregate model of the operation of a hub-and-spoke network that takes into account passenger itineraries (ie direct and connecting) and all forms of itinerary disruptions (ie delayed flights, cancelled flights and missed connections). This model shows that the reduction in lost economic productivity generated from NAS-wide simulations is under-reported, as passenger trip delays due to delayed flights only account for approximately 40% of the total passenger trip delays. Furthermore, the model identifies the significant roles played by factors other than flight performance, such as airline itinerary structure, airline fleet mix (ie aircraft size), load factors and airline hub banking structure, on total passenger trip delay. For example, a 7-10% increase in load-factor can nullify the reduction in total passenger trip delay gained by a 5% improvement in on-time performance achieved by NextGen.

Multi-agent Simulation of Airline Operations and Infrastructure Utilization in the Presence of Airline Strategies,"Guillermo Calderón-Meza, Lance Sherry","Investment in the NextGen National Airspace System (NAS) is intended to increase the effective capacity of the airspace and airports. Previous research, in several domains, has identified cases where large infrastructure investments were under-utilized due to migration and/or adaptation of users (eg airlines).This paper examines the impact of airline “gaming” on the use of trans-continental routes. Two airlines with equal cost structures are given options for two trans-continental routes each with different distances. In the base case, the airlines conform to the rules of an air traffic controller and are assigned to the routes to balance traffic. In other cases, airlines select a preferred route based on information about the length of the route, and the length of the departure queue. The airlines act as independent agents, and each scenario is repeated several times to account for the stochastic elements in the simulation. The results indicate a tradeoff between utilization of the resources and cost to the users. Results also indicate that alternate strategies could migrate closer to the optimal tradeoff between utilization and user costs. The implications of these results are discussed.","Scholar articles Multi-agent Simulation of Airline Operations and Infrastructure Utilization in the Presence of Airline StrategiesG Calderón-Meza, L SherryRelated articles All 3 versions ","Investment in the NextGen National Airspace System (NAS) is intended to increase the effective capacity of the airspace and airports.

MCP CONTROL DEVICE INVOKES MORE THAN ONE AUTOPILOT BEHAVIORL Sherry, M Feary, P Polson, E PalmerRelated articles All 2 versions ","A class of automation surprises can be attributed to the fact that the same mode control panel (MCP) knob results in two distinct autopilot control behaviors depending on the situation. For example, one behavior flies to, and captures, the MCP altitude, the other behavior breaks the capture and flies away from the MCP altitude. This paper describes a formal modeling technique for identifying MCP control devices that change their function in different contexts. This paper also describes how the contents of the formal modeling technique can be used to develop training and to set criteria used for certification.",
A New Conceptual Model,Lance Sherry,"This paper introduces and utilizes a new conceptual model of the avionics, the Cockpit System Model (Sherry, 1994), to analyze operational issues associated with flight mode annunciation documented in the literature. The Model decomposes the mission of flying a modern airliner from origin to destination into five asynchronous tasks: flightplanning, navigation, guidance, control, and stability augmentation. FMAs and MCPs in current glass cockpit aircraft use annunciation schemes that are generalizations of designs that were originally developed for an earlier generation of avionics systems that only automated control and stability augmentation tasks.There are numerous operational consequences of extending annunciation schemes and conceptual models appropriate to avionics that automated control and stability augmentation tasks to modern avionics systems that automate all five tasks. Pilots have to utilize …",Scholar articles A New Conceptual ModelL SherryRelated articles ,"This paper introduces and utilizes a new conceptual model of the avionics, the Cockpit System Model (Sherry, 1994), to analyze operational issues associated with flight mode annunciation documented in the literature.

ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE COLLABORATIVE ROUTE SELECTION STRATEGIES BASED ON COST AND THROUGHPUT,"YE Bojia, Lance Sherry, Minghua Hu, Chun-Hung Chen","Air Traffic Flow Management (TFM) is a collaborative process between the airspace provider (ATCSCC) and the airspace users (AOCs). The result of the collaboration should be an outcome that maximizes the utility of the system without excessively penalizing any of the agents. This paper describes the results of a tradeoff analysis between flight costs and sector throughput for combinations of ATCSCC and AOC strategies for flight-plan route selections in the presence of weather that affects enroute airspace capacity. The analysis is conducted using a discrete event simulation model of an airspace network with several airports, sectors and alternative airways. The results of the analysis indicate that when both Miles-in-Trails (MIT) restrictions for the airspace, as well as, TFM rerouting in collaboration with the AOC takes place, the performance of the overall system achieves a reduction of 67% in delay costs, 61% in delay time, 22% in delay rate and 69% in total passengers delay time (compared to the baseline). The implications of the results are discussed in this paper.","Scholar articles ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE COLLABORATIVE ROUTE SELECTION STRATEGIES BASED ON COST AND THROUGHPUTYE Bojia, L Sherry, M Hu, CH ChenRelated articles All 4 versions ","Air Traffic Flow Management (TFM) is a collaborative process between the airspace provider (ATCSCC) and the airspace users (AOCs).
