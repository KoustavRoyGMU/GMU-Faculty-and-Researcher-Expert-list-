A Survey on Anti-spoofing Schemes for Fingerprint Recognition Systems,"Emanuela Marasco, Arun Ross",2015,Journal ACM Computing Surveys Volume 47 Issue 2,"Several issues related to the vulnerability of fingerprint recognition systems to attacks have been highlighted in the biometrics literature. One such vulnerability involves the use of artificial fingers, where materials such as Play-Doh, silicone, and gelatin are inscribed with fingerprint ridges. Researchers have demonstrated that some commercial fingerprint recognition systems can be deceived when these artificial fingers are placed on the sensor; that is, the system successfully processes the ensuing fingerprint images, thereby allowing an adversary to spoof the fingerprints of another individual. However, at the same time, several countermeasures that discriminate between live fingerprints and spoof artifacts have been proposed. While some of these antispoofing schemes are hardware based, several software-based approaches have been proposed as well. In this article, we review the literature and present the state …",351
Combining perspiration-and morphology-based static features for fingerprint liveness detection,"Emanuela Marasco, Carlo Sansone",2012/7/1,Journal Pattern Recognition Letters,"It has been showed that, by employing fake fingers, the existing fingerprint recognition systems may be easily deceived. So, there is an urgent need for improving their security. Software-based liveness detection algorithms typically exploit morphological and perspiration-based characteristics separately to measure the vitality. Both such features provide discriminant information about live and fake fingers, then, it is reasonable to investigate also their joint contribution. In this paper, we combine a set of the most robust morphological and perspiration-based measures. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been assessed through a comparison with several state-of-the-art techniques for liveness detection. Experiments have been carried out, for the first time, by adopting standard databases. They have been taken from the Liveness Detection Competition 2009 whose data have been acquired by using three …",98
Fingerprint Liveness Detection based on Histograms of Invariant Gradients,"Carsten Gottschlich, Emanuela Marasco, Allen Y Yang, Bojan Cukic",2014,Conference International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB),"Security of fingerprint authentication systems remains threatened by the presentation of spoof artifacts. Most current mitigation approaches rely upon the fingerprint liveness detection as the main anti-spoofing mechanisms. However, liveness detection algorithms are not robust to sensor variations. In other words, typical liveness detection algorithms need to be retrained and adapted to each and every sensor used for fingerprint capture. In this paper, inspired by popular invariant feature descriptors such as histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), we propose a new invariant descriptor of fingerprint ridge texture called histograms of invariant gradients (HIG). The proposed descriptor is designed to preserve robustness to variations in gradient positions. Spoofed fingerprints are detected using multiple histograms of invariant gradients computed from spatial neighborhoods …",97
An anti-spoofing technique using multiple textural features in fingerprint scanners,"Emanuela Marasco, Carlo Sansone",2010/9/9,Conference 2010 IEEE workshop on biometric measurements and systems for security and medical applications,"Fingerprint verification systems may be circumvented by fake fingerprints produced using inexpensive materials like gelatin or silicon. An efficient countermeasure against these attacks is given by liveness detection. In the recent literature, different algorithms for detecting signs of vitality have been proposed. The cheapest techniques are software-based and utilize acquired fingerprint images in order to extract static or dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel software-based solution for liveness detection based on static features coming out from the visual texture of the image. The reported results show that the use of our features effectively improves the discriminative power (between live and fake fingerprints) achieved by the algorithms proposed during the Liveness Detection Competition 2009.",52
Combining match scores with liveness values in a fingerprint verification system,"Emanuela Marasco, Yaohui Ding, Arun Ross",2012/9/23,"Conference 2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","We discuss the problem of combining biometric match scores with liveness measure values in the context of fingerprint verification. Recent literature has focused on the development of methods to assess if an input fingerprint sample is a “live” entity or a “spoof” artefact. This is commonly done by generating a single-valued numerical entity referred to as the liveness measure value. However, the problem of combining this liveness value with match scores has not been rigorously investigated. The goal of this work is to design a framework in which a liveness detector is incorporated with a fingerprint matcher. We first design and analyze three different methods to combine match scores with liveness values. Next, we introduce a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) scheme that models the relationship between match scores and liveness values.

On the robustness of fingerprint liveness detection algorithms against new materials used for spoofing,"Emanuela Marasco, Carlo Sansone",2011,Conference Biosignals 2011 International Conference on Bio-Inspired Systems and Signal Processing,"Fingerprint biometric systems may be deceived by attacks at sensor level that use fake fingers. A secure fingerprint scanner is required to possess the ability to determine if the image comes from a living individual or not. Recently, several liveness detection approaches have been proposed to address this problem. At present performances of the existing software-based solutions have been assessed with different sensors and using small data sets. Moreover, it is assumed that fake fingerprints are produced by adopting the same materials used for training the system. This paper looks at the cases where the test spoof finger is made by employing a material new for the fingerprint sensor. We propose an experimental comparison among the current fingerprint liveness detection approaches accomplished by adopting materials for training different than those used for testing.

Exploiting quality and texture features to estimate age and gender from fingerprints,"Emanuela Marasco, Luca Lugini, Bojan Cukic",2014/5/29,Conference Proc. of SPIE,"Age and gender of an individual, when available, can contribute to identification decisions provided by primary biometrics and help improve matching performance.

Current approaches for predicting age and gender generally exploit features such as ridge count, and white lines count that are manually extracted. Existing automated approaches have significant limitations in accuracy especially when dealing with data pertaining to elderly females. The model proposed in this paper exploits image quality features synthesized from 40 different frequency bands, and image texture properties captured using the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and the Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) operators.

Secure Multibiometric Systems.,Emanuela Marasco,2010/11,"Institution University of Naples Federico II, Italy","The authentication process determines or verifies the identity of an individual. It assumes significant importance in high security applications, such as logical access to personal computers, cellular phone, ATMs, or physical access to buildings, border crossing [63]. Traditionally, to ensure that only authorized users access to the protected services, possessionbased (badges) or knowledge-based (passwords) solutions have been adopted. However, when a password is divulged to an unauthorized user or a badge is stolen by an impostor, these authentication schemes may be deceived. Vulnerabilities of such schemes are being addressed by the emergence of biometric systems which establish the identity of an individual based on what the person is, rather than what the person carries or remembers [45]. The identity of an individual is encoded by different biometric traits, such as fingerprints, hand geometry, iris, retina, face, hand vein, facial thermograms, signature, voiceprint, gait, palmprint, referred to as biometric modalities (see Fig. 1.1).

The identity corresponding to the best score is then associated with that of the probe. The aim of this work is to predict identification errors and improve the recognition accuracy of the biométrie system. The method utilizes the rank and score information generated by the identification operation in order to validate the output.

Given the difference in terms of capacitive values between skin-sensor and air-sensor contact, the variation in capacitance between valleys and ridges can be measured when the finger is placed on the sensor• In Thermal sensors, the finger is placed on pyro-electric material which converts variations in temperature into voltage. The contact of the ridges with the sensing material causes a change in temperature, while the temperature remains constant under the valleys that are not in direct contact with the material. The signal (image) disappears once a thermal equilibrium is reached between the finger and the chip","• In Capacitive sensors, the finger is modeled as the upper electrode of a capacitor, while a metal plate is modeled as the lower electrode.

Biometric multi‐factor authentication: On the usability of the FingerPIN scheme,"Emanuela Marasco, Massimiliano Albanese, Venkata Vamsi Ram Patibandla, Anudeep Vurity, Sumanth Sai Sriram",2023/1,Journal Security and Privacy,"Fingerprint‐based authentication has been successfully adopted in a wide range of applications, including law enforcement and immigration, due to its numerous advantages over traditional password‐based authentication. Despite the usability and accuracy of this technology, some significant concerns still exist, which can potentially hinder its further adoption. For instance, a fingerprint is permanently associated with an individual and, once stolen, cannot be replaced, thus compromising biometric‐based authentication. To mitigate this concern, we previously designed a multi‐factor authentication approach that integrates Type‐1 and Type‐3 authentication factors into a fingerprint‐based personal identification number (PIN). To authenticate, a subject is required to present a sequence of fingerprints corresponding to the digits of the PIN, based on a predefined secret mapping between digits and fingers. We …",1
Fingerphoto Presentation Attack Detection: Generalization in Smartphones,"Emanuela Marasco, Anudeep Vurity",2021/12/15,Conference 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),"A fingerphoto is obtained by imaging a human finger using a basic smartphone camera. Although impressive advances have been made to accurately match fingerphotos, this technology is vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs). These algorithms do not generalize well in the presence of new presentation attacks. While previous research on this issue is limited, this paper systematically evaluates fingerphoto presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms under unknown attacks. The proposed assessment compares different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the IIITD Smartphone Fingerphoto database with spoof data including printout and various display attacks. These images used for the experiments were acquired indoors and subjected to background (i.e., white or natural) and capture device (i.e., Nokia or OPO) variations. Preliminary results show that the PAD based on AlexNet is robust under most …",1
Accounting for Demographic Differentials in Forensic Error Rate Assessment of Latent Prints via Covariate-Specific ROC Regression,"Emanuela Marasco, Mengling He, Larry Tang, Sumanth Sriram",2021,"Conference Computer Vision and Image Processing: 5th International Conference, CVIP 2020, Prayagraj, India, December 4-6, 2020, Revised Selected Papers, Part I 5","The challenge of understanding how automated tools might introduce bias has gained a lot of interest. If biases are not interpreted and solved, algorithms might reinforce societal discrimination and injustices. It is also not clear how to measure fairness in algorithms. In biometrics disciplines such as automatic facial recognition, examining images pertaining to male subjects has been proven does not yield the same error rates as when examining images from female subjects. Furthermore, recent studies found that automatic fingerprint match scores vary based on an individual’s age and gender. Although ROC curve has been essential for assessing classification performance, the presence of covariates can affect the discriminatory capacity. It might be advisable to incorporate these covariates in the ROC curve to exploit the additional information that they provide. More importantly, the ROC regression …",1
FingerPIN: an authentication mechanism integrating fingerprints and personal identification numbers,"Emanuela Marasco, Massimiliano Albanese",2021,"Conference Computer Vision and Image Processing: 5th International Conference, CVIP 2020, Prayagraj, India, December 4-6, 2020, Revised Selected Papers, Part I 5","Fingerprint-based authentication has been successfully adopted in a wide range of applications, including law enforcement and immigration, due to its numerous advantages over traditional password-based authentication.

Privacy protection schemes for fingerprint recognition systems,"Emanuela Marasco, Bojan Cukic",2015/5/15,Conference Biometric and Surveillance Technology for Human and Activity Identification XII,"The deployment of fingerprint recognition systems has always raised concerns related to personal privacy. A fingerprint is permanently associated with an individual and, generally, it cannot be reset if compromised in one application. Given that fingerprints are not a secret, potential misuses besides personal recognition represent privacy threats and may lead to public distrust. Privacy mechanisms control access to personal information and limit the likelihood of intrusions. In this paper, image- and feature-level schemes for privacy protection in fingerprint recognition systems are reviewed. Storing only key features of a biometric signature can reduce the likelihood of biometric data being used for unintended purposes. In biometric cryptosystems and biometric-based key release, the biometric component verifies the identity of the user, while the cryptographic key protects the communication channel.

Attack Trees for Protecting Biometric Systems against Evolving Presentation Attacks,"Emanuela Marasco, Bojan Cukic, Mohamed Shehab, R Usman",16th Annual IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST) 2017,"Description Several reports have highlighted that spoofing biometric traits represents a serious threat for active identity management systems. Applications of biometrics are critically important technologies for traveler, immigration and refugee management systems deployed or considered for deployment by the Department of Homeland Security. Due to motivations and consequences of identity misrepresentations at US borders, threats specific to these categories differ from generic biometric applications. Thus, there is a strong need to reduce the risk of spoof-based fraud mitigation strategies are needed. Biometric system attack vector analysis is growing but still not as fast as the general level of security threats. Therefore, in this paper we analyze feasibility of biometric presentation attacks behind identity misrepresentation and discuss a practical methodology for classifying biometric identity attack vectors based on their risks. The classification will lead towards practical vulnerability assessment methods and countermeasures, technical as well as managerial. Our findings aim to enable identification of biometric presentation attack risks and severities, leading towards a welldefined defense strategy.","Several reports have highlighted that spoofing biometric traits represents a serious threat for active identity management systems.

Late Deep Fusion of Color Spaces to Enhance Finger Photo Presentation Attack Detection in Smartphones,"Emanuela Marasco, Anudeep Vurity",2022/11/10,Journal Applied Sciences,"Finger photo recognition represents a promising touchless technology that offers portable and hygienic authentication solutions in smartphones, eliminating physical contact. Public spaces, such as banks and staff-less stores, benefit from contactless authentication considering the current public health sphere. The user captures the image of their own finger by using the camera integrated in a mobile device. Although recent research has pushed boundaries of finger photo matching, the security of this biometric methodology still represents a concern. Existing systems have been proven to be vulnerable to print attacks by presenting a color paper-printout in front of the camera and photo attacks that consist of displaying the original image in front of the capturing device. This paper aims to improve the performance of finger photo presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms by investigating deep fusion strategies to combine deep representations obtained from different color spaces. In this work, spoofness is described by combining different color models. The proposed framework integrates multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs), each trained using patches extracted from a specific color model and centered around minutiae points. Experiments were carried out on a publicly available database of spoofed finger photos obtained from the IIITD Smartphone Finger photo Database with spoof data, including printouts and various display attacks. The results show that deep fusion of the best color models improved the robustness of the PAD system and competed with the state-of-the-art.",
Mitigating the Impact of Hand Sanitizer on the Spectral Signature of Finger Hypercubes,"Emanuela Marasco, Yuanting Tao",2022/10/10,Conference 2022 IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB),"The proposed study seeks to shed light on whether hand sanitizer impacts the spectral signature of hyperspectral fingerprint images. In the hyperspectral domain, fingerprint data consists of stacked images across pre-defined wavelengths. We process the central region of the fingerprint foreground through various techniques that account for baseline shifts in heterogeneous samples, different lighting conditions, and background noise. A non-parametric classifier-based two-sample test adapted to hyperspectral data is conducted to determine whether significant differences exist between samples acquired before and after applying hand sanitizer. Experiments were carried out on hyperspectral fingerprint images acquired from 50 subjects. For every image, 100 pixels selected for this analysis, with each pixel featured by 300 spectrum bands. Findings imply that, the spectra generated from the data without applying …",
Demographic-Adapted ROC Curve for Assessing Automated Matching of Latent Fingerprints,"Emanuela Marasco, Mengling He, Larry Tang, Sumanth Sriram",2022/5,Journal SN Computer Science,"Although the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system has been effectively assessed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the presence of covariates can affect the discriminatory capacity. This research investigates how automated tools used in forensics introduce demographic biases and discusses performance unfairness mitigation strategies. In our previous work, we evaluated the impact of demographic differentials in automatic matching of latent fingerprints and incorporated these covariates in the ROC curve. The resulting adjusted ROC curve provided error rates that account for an individual’s demographic information, which is a better measure of the discriminatory capacity compared to the pooled ROC curve. Our ROC regression model was also able to handle continuous covariates such as age as well as discrete covariates such as gender and ethnicity. In this paper, we extend the …",
Demographic Effects in Latent Fingerprint Matching and their Relation to Image Quality,"Emanuela Marasco, Mengling He, Larry Tang, Yuanting Tao",2022/3/11,Book 2022 7th International Conference on Machine Learning Technologies (ICMLT)," Automatic processing of latent fingerprints can alleviate the subjectivity inherent in feature markups done by examiners that may be affected by factors such as visual perception, expertise and workload. Despite several benefits, the use of algorithmic decision systems is also associated with different risks for individuals, such as discrimination and unfair practices. The goal of this paper is to analyze the fairness of prediction and decision-making in forensics through discovering and mitigation of biases in automated algorithms operating on latent fingerprint images. Previous work analyzes biases only in match scores without considering the impact of image quality that is crucial to the reliability of the matching algorithm. Furthermore, due to their learning-based nature, quality predictors may be biased as well. In our previous work, we carried out an ROC regression analysis related to the demographic effects on latent …",
Exploiting cohorts information in multibiometric identification systems via graph-based fusion,"Emanuela Marasco, Carlo Sansone",2013/9/9,Conference 2013 IEEE Workshop on Biometric Measurements and Systems for Security and Medical Applications,"A biometric identification system determines the identity of a given biometric input data, among a set of gallery identities stored in the database. The existing identification techniques typically base the decision on the match scores representing the similarity between the query and the template of each gallery. The strategies proposed so far for combining different biometric identification systems usually use only the rank one identity unimodal output in order to compute the integrated evidence of the i th  person. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for fusion at hybrid rank-score level based on graph models where an additional information concerning the non-matched scores is exploited. Experiments were carried out on two multimodal databases and they demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for identification performance improvement.",
