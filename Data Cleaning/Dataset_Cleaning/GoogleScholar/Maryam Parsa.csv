Probabilistic deep spiking neural systems enabled by magnetic tunnel junction,"Abhronil Sengupta, Maryam Parsa, Bing Han, Kaushik Roy",2016/5/25,Journal IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices,"Deep spiking neural networks are becoming increasingly powerful tools for cognitive computing platforms. However, most of the existing studies on such computing models are developed with limited insights on the underlying hardware implementation, resulting in area and power expensive designs. Although several neuromimetic devices emulating neural operations have been proposed recently, their functionality has been limited to very simple neural models that may prove to be inefficient at complex recognition tasks. In this paper, we venture into the relatively unexplored area of utilizing the inherent device stochasticity of such neuromimetic devices to model complex neural functionalities in a probabilistic framework in the time domain. We consider the implementation of a deep spiking neural network capable of performing high-accuracy and lowlatency classification tasks, where the neural computing unit is …",105

Besides displaying effective thermal performance reductions up to 50% at the active junctions in agreement with prior studies, our steady-state thermal images reveal that, remarkably, 1–3 μm adjacent to submicron devices the crosstalk is actually …",65
"Bayesian multi-objective hyperparameter optimization for accurate, fast, and efficient neural network accelerator design","Maryam Parsa, John P Mitchell, Catherine D Schuman, Robert M Patton, Thomas E Potok, Kaushik Roy",2020/7/21,Journal Frontiers in neuroscience,"In resource-constrained environments, such as low-power edge devices and smart sensors, deploying a fast, compact, and accurate intelligent system with minimum energy is indispensable. Embedding intelligence can be achieved using neural networks on neuromorphic hardware. Designing such networks would require determining several inherent hyperparameters. A key challenge is to find the optimum set of hyperparameters that might belong to the input/output encoding modules, the neural network itself, the application, or the underlying hardware. In this work, we present a hierarchical pseudo agent-based multi-objective Bayesian hyperparameter optimization framework (both software and hardware) that not only maximizes the performance of the network, but also minimizes the energy and area requirements of the corresponding neuromorphic hardware. We validate performance of our approach (in terms of accuracy and computation speed) on several control and classification applications on digital and mixed-signal (memristor-based) neural accelerators. We show that the optimum set of hyperparameters might drastically improve the performance of one application (i.e., 52–71% for Pole-Balance), while having minimum effect on another (i.e., 50–53% for RoboNav). In addition, we demonstrate resiliency of different input/output encoding, training neural network, or the underlying accelerator modules in a neuromorphic system to the changes of the hyperparameters.",37

Double-edge triggered Flip-Flops have the data signal changes on both the clock edges. Thus, low swing clock results in lower power consumption and the data throughout are preserved. Today, the leakage current has become a critical feature for integrated circuit (IC) designers because it leads to more power consumption. So in this paper some methods have been presented to control the leakage current. The proposed circuit is simulated in 0.35 μm CMOS technology with the power supply of 1.5V. The simulations are carried out by applying HSPICE software. The results of the proposed circuit show 180nW power dissipation.

When these conditions are not satisfied, we show how very simple simulators can still be used to both (i) design new multi-robot systems, and (ii) guide real-world swarming experiments towards certain emergent behaviors when the gap is very large. The key ideas are an iterative simulator-in-the-design-loop in which real-world experiments, simulator modifications, and simulated experiments are intimately coupled in a way that minds the gap without needing to shrink it, as well as the use of minimally viable phase diagrams to guide real world experiments.

Spiking neuromorphic computers natively implement network-like computation and have been shown to be successful at implementing certain types of graph computations. In this work, we evaluate the use of a simulated network of spiking neurons to perform semi-supervised learning on graph data using only the graph structure. We demonstrate that our neuromorphic approach provides comparable results to graph convolutional network results, and we discuss the opportunities for using neuromorphic computers for this task in the future.",

This work describes the significance of each of the eight datasets and their associated challenge questions. The challenge questions for each dataset were required to cover multiple difficulty levels. An international call for participation was sent to students, asking them to form teams of up to six people and apply novel data analytics and edge computing methods to solve these challenges.",
Publisher Correction: Opportunities for neuromorphic computing algorithms and applications,"Catherine D Schuman, Shruti R Kulkarni, Maryam Parsa, J Parker Mitchell, Prasanna Date, Bill Kay",2022/3,Journal Nature Computational Science,"In the version of this article initially published, there was a miswording in the third sentence of the “Widening usability and access to hardware and simulators” section. The sentence has been clarified to now read:“Several open-source neuromorphic simulators have support for different hardware back ends, such as multinode CPUs, GPUs, and emerging neuromorphic hardware (for example, SpiNNaker103).” The amendment has been made in the HTML and PDF versions of the article.",
IRIS: Integrated Retinal Functionality in Image Sensors,"Zihan Yin, Md Abdullah-Al Kaiser, Lamine Ousmane Camara, Mark Camarena, Maryam Parsa, Ajey Jacob, Gregory Schwartz, Akhilesh Jaiswal",2022,Journal bioRxiv,"Neuromorphic image sensors draw inspiration from the biological retina to implement visual computations in electronic hardware. Gain control in phototransduction and temporal differen- tiation at the first retinal synapse inspired the first generation of neuromorphic sensors, but pro- cessing in downstream retinal circuits, much of which has been discovered in the past decade, has not been implemented in image sensor technology. We present a technology-circuit co- design solution that implements two motion computations occurring at the output of the retina that could have wide applications for vision based decision making in dynamic environments. Our simulations on Globalfoundries 22nm technology node show that, by taking advantage of the recent advances in semiconductor chip stacking technology, the proposed retina-inspired circuits can be fabricated on image sensing platforms in existing semiconductor foundries. In- tegrated Retinal Functionality in Image Sensors (IRIS) technology could drive advances in ma- chine vision applications that demand robust, high-speed, energy-efficient and low-bandwidth real-time decision making.",
Optimum Replacement Policies of Conventional Energy Sources by Clean Ones Subject to Current Electricity Demand,"Maryam Parsa, NasirUddin Ahmed, Mustapha CE Yagoub",2014/2/1,Journal International Journal of Energy Science,"Developing optimum decision policy for gradual replacement of conventional energy sources by clean ones is an important field of current research and the main concern of this article. Eight main energy sources are considered and the decision policies are formulated with the objective of minimizing the implementation and environmental costs while meeting the electricity demand during the entire plan period. The selected energy sources are Coal, Petroleum, Natural Gas, Hydropower, Wind, Solar, Geothermal and Biomass.",
