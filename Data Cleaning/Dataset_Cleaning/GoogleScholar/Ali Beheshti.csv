Asperity micro-contact models as applied to the deformation of rough line contact,"Ali Beheshti, MM Khonsari",2012/8/1,Journal Tribology International,"Different statistical micro-contact models including Greenwood–Williamson (GW), Chang–Etsion–Bogy (CEB), Zhou–Maietta–Chang (ZMC), Kogut–Etsion (KE) and Jackson–Green (JG) are employed together with the bulk deformation of the bounding solids to predict dry rough line-contact characteristics such as the apparent pressure profile, contact width and real area of contact. The approach involves solving the micro-contact models and separation formulas simultaneously. Comparison of different contact models reveals that the use of elastic–plastic micro-contact models predicts a lower maximum normal pressure and a greater contact width and real contact area compared to the GW model. Further, based on the results of numerical simulations, useful relationships are provided for the prediction of the maximum contact pressure, contact width, real area of contact and pressure distribution.",128

Available wear models cannot estimate a wear coefficient for SMAs, since they do not consider the effects of phase transformation and the related phenomena. This study presents a methodology considering thermomechanical behavior of shape memory alloys in sliding wear. Wear analysis is carried out for a superelastic SMA under different loads and temperatures, and the results are validated by experimental findings. The proposed approach introduces a constant wear coefficient at different loads and temperatures supporting its reliability for quantitative description of wear in an SMA.",2
Substrate-regulated nanoscale friction of graphene,"Michael Munther, Tyler Palma, Ali Beheshti, Keivan Davami",2018/6/15,Journal Materials Letters,"In the present study, nanotribological measurements were performed via atomic force microscopy on Si/SiO2-supported graphene monolayers with varying oxide layer thicknesses. The observations uncovered significant discrepancies in resulting friction forces between each graphene sample. Nanoscale interfacial friction forces were observed to increase from ∼0.49 nN to ∼1.00 nN when the oxide layer thickness was increased from 90 nm to 300 nm. The findings were determined to be the result of increased phonon scattering which is responsible for the removal of the vibrational reduction of nanoscale friction. Such discrepancies in friction forces points toward the potential tunability of nanoscale friction in supported graphene.",2
ANALYSIS OF STRIP RESIDUAL CURVATURES IN ANTI-CROSSBOW CASSETTE IN TENSION LEVELING PROCESS,"Mostafa Jamshidian, Ali Beheshti, A Sadeghi Dolatabadi, M Olfat Nia, Mahmoud Salimi",2008,Journal Steel Research International,"Tension leveling is a process used in steel industry in order to remove any shape defects present in temper rolled strip. Although strip bad shapes come into sight as edge waves, centre buckles and quarter buckles can be corrected giving the strip a suitable amount of elongation in work rolls cassette, such defects of so-called crossbow and coil set known as residual curvatures are inevitable because in the process the strip undergoes repeated bending. These undesired curvatures can be corrected in anti-crossbow and anti-coil set cassettes, giving the strip an optimum amount of curvature. In this paper a theoretical analysis based on incremental theory of plasticity and considering mixed mode hardening for material behavior has been employed in order to study the effect of primary process parameters namely work curvature and tension on strip residual curvatures coming out of the work rolls cassette and then to analyze variation of these curvatures with respect to second bending curvature in anti-crossbow cassette. Review of the results presents a method for determining the optimal work curvature in anti-crossbow cassette to remove residual curvatures especially transverse residual curvature or crossbow.",2
Laser Peening Analysis of Aluminum 5083: A Finite Element Study,"Ali Tajyar, Noah Holtham, Nicholas Brooks, Lloyd Hackel, Vincent Sherman, Ali Beheshti, Keivan Davami",2021/12/7,Journal Quantum Beam Science,"In this research, a finite element (FE) technique was used to predict the residual stresses in laser-peened aluminum 5083 at different power densities. A dynamic pressure profile was used to create the pressure wave in an explicit model, and the stress results were extracted once the solution was stabilized. It is shown that as power density increases from 0.5 to 4 GW/cm2, the induced residual stresses develop monotonically deeper from 0.42 to 1.40 mm. However, with an increase in the power density, the maximum magnitude of the sub-surface stresses increases only up to a certain threshold (1 GW/cm2 for aluminum 5083). Above this threshold, a complex interaction of the elastic and plastic waves occurring at peak pressures above ≈2.5 Hugoniot Elastic Limit (HEL) results in decreased surface stresses. The FE results are corroborated with physical experiments and observations.",1
A thermodynamic framework for treatment of fretting fatigue,"Ali Beheshti, Michael M Khonsari",2023/1/1,Book Fretting Wear and Fretting Fatigue,"Building upon the successful treatment of several tribological degradation phenomena within the unifying thermodynamic framework, this chapter presents a robust predictive methodology specific to the analysis of fretting fatigue crack nucleation. A thermodynamically based continuum damage mechanics approach is adopted along with surface and subsurface stress fields as well as a nonlocal averaging technique to simulate the progressive accumulation of microdamage near the contact area. General agreement between the predictions and the experimental observations for both smooth and rough surface contacts confirms the ability of the current technique to predict fretting fatigue crack initiation behavior. In addition, due to its inherent benefits, the framework presented here is believed to have a high potential to be extended for the analysis of crack nucleation in several other contact problems.",
Multiscale Analysis of Contact in Smooth and Rough Surfaces: Contact Characteristics and Tribo-Damage,Ali Beheshti,2013,Institution Louisiana State University and Agricultural & Mechanical College,"This dissertation is comprised of two major interrelated foci. The first focus is to investigate the effect of surface roughness on the behavior of dry contacting bodies through both deterministic and statistical approaches. In the current research, different statistical micro-contact models are employed together with the bulk deformation of the bounding solids to predict the characteristics of the dry rough line-contact and elliptical point-contact including the apparent pressure profile, contact dimensions and real area of contact. Further, based on the results of numerical simulations, useful relationships are provided for the contact characteristics. In addition, a robust approach for the deterministic prediction of pressure and tangential traction distributions in dry rough contact configuration subjected to stick-slip condition is presented with provision for elastic-fully plastic asperity effects.",
