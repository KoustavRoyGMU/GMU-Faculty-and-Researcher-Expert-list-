How to misuse AODV: a case study of insider attacks against mobile ad-hoc routing protocols,"Peng Ning, Kun Sun",2003/6,"Conference Information Assurance Workshop, 2003. IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society","This paper presents a systematic analysis of insider attacks against mobile ad-hoc routing protocols, using the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol as an example. It identifies a number of attack goals, and then studies how to achieve these goals through misuses of the routing messages. To facilitate the analysis, it classifies insider attacks into two categories: atomic misuses and compound misuses. Atomic misuses are performed by manipulating a single routing message, which cannot be further divided; compound misuses are composed of combinations of atomic misuses and possibly normal uses of the routing protocol. The analysis results in this paper reveal several classes of insider attacks, including route disruption, route invasion, node isolation, and resource consumption. Finally, this paper presents simulation results that validate and demonstrate the impact of these attacks.",343
Efficient self-healing group key distribution with revocation capability,"Donggang Liu, Peng Ning, Kun Sun",2003/10/27,Book Proceedings of the 10th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,"This paper presents group key distribution techniques for large and dynamic groups over unreliable channels. The techniques proposed here are based on the self-healing key distribution methods (with revocation capability) recently developed by Staddon et al. [27]. By introducing a novel personal key distribution technique, this paper reduces (1) the communication overhead of personal key share distribution from O(t2log q) to O(tlogq), (2) the communication overhead of self-healing key distribution with t-revocation capability from O((mt2+tm)log q) to O(mtlog q), and (3) the storage overhead of the self-healing key distribution with -revocation capability at each group member from O(m2log q) to O(mlogq), where  is the maximum number of colluding group members,  is the number of sessions, and  is a prime number that is large enough to accommodate a cryptographic key.

Hypercheck: A hardware-assistedintegrity monitor,"Fengwei Zhang, Jiang Wang, Kun Sun, Angelos Stavrou",2013/12/12,Journal IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,"The advent of cloud computing and inexpensive multi-core desktop architectures has led to the widespread adoption of virtualization technologies. Furthermore, security researchers embraced virtual machine monitors (VMMs) as a new mechanism to guarantee deep isolation of untrusted software components, which, coupled with their popularity, promoted VMMs as a prime target for exploitation. In this paper, we present HyperCheck, a hardware-assisted tampering detection framework designed to protect the integrity of hypervisors and operating systems. Our approach leverages System Management Mode (SMM), a CPU mode in ×86 architecture, to transparently and securely acquire and transmit the full state of a protected machine to a remote server.

TinySeRSync: secure and resilient time synchronization in wireless sensor networks,"Kun Sun, Peng Ning, Cliff Wang",2006/10/30,Book Proceedings of the 13th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,"Accurate and synchronized time is crucial in many sensor network applications due to the need for consistent distributed sensing and coordination. In hostile environments where an adversary may attack the networks and/or the applications through external or compromised nodes, time synchronization becomes an attractive target due to its importance. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of TinySeRSync, a secure and resilient time synchronization subsystem for wireless sensor networks running TinyOS. This paper makes three contributions: First, it develops a secure single-hop pairwise time synchronization technique using hardware-assisted, authenticated medium access control (MAC) layer timestamping.

Secure and resilient clock synchronization in wireless sensor networks,"Kun Sun, Peng Ning, Cliff Wang",2006/2/6,Journal IEEE Journal on selected areas in communications,"Wireless sensor networks have received a lot of attention recently due to its wide applications. An accurate and synchronized clock time is crucial in many sensor network applications. Several clock synchronization schemes have been proposed for wireless sensor networks recently to address the resource constraints in such networks. However, most of these techniques assume benign environments, but cannot survive malicious attacks in hostile environments, especially when there are compromised nodes. As an exception, a recent work attempts to detect malicious attacks against clock synchronization, and aborts when an attack is detected. Though this approach can prevent incorrect clock synchronization due to attacks, it will lead to denial of clock synchronization in such situations. This paper adopts a model where all the sensor nodes synchronize their clocks to a common source, which is assumed to be well …",157
Secure distributed cluster formation in wireless sensor networks,"Kun Sun, Pai Peng, Peng Ning, Cliff Wang",2006/12/11,Conference 2006 22nd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC'06),"In wireless sensor networks, clustering sensor nodes into small groups is an effective technique to achieve scalability, self-organization, power saving, channel access, routing, etc. A number of cluster formation protocols have been proposed recently. However, most existing protocols assume benign environments, and are vulnerable to attacks from malicious nodes. In this paper, we propose a secure distributed cluster formation protocol to organize sensor networks into mutually disjoint cliques. Our protocol has the following properties: (1) normal nodes are divided into mutually disjoint cliques; (2) all the normal nodes in each clique agree on the same clique memberships; (3) while external attackers can be prevented from participating in the cluster formation process, inside attackers that do not follow the protocol semantics can be identified and removed from the network; (4) the communication overhead is …",140
Motag: Moving target defense against internet denial of service attacks,"Quan Jia, Kun Sun, Angelos Stavrou",2013/7/30,Conference 2013 22nd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks still pose a significant threat to critical infrastructure and Internet services alike. In this paper, we propose MOTAG, a moving target defense mechanism that secures service access for authenticated clients against flooding DDoS attacks. MOTAG employs a group of dynamic packet indirection proxies to relay data traffic between legitimate clients and the protected servers. Our design can effectively inhibit external attackers' attempts to directly bombard the network infrastructure. As a result, attackers will have to collude with malicious insiders in locating secret proxies and then initiating attacks. However, MOTAG can isolate insider attacks from innocent clients by continuously ""moving"" secret proxies to new network locations while shuffling client-to-proxy assignments. We develop a greedy shuffling algorithm to minimize the number of proxy re- allocations (shuffles) while …",131
TrustOTP: Transforming smartphones into secure one-time password tokens,"He Sun, Kun Sun, Yuewu Wang, Jiwu Jing",2015/10/12,Book Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"Two-factor authentication has been widely used due to the vulnerabilities associated with traditional text-based password. One-time password (OTP) plays an indispensable role on authenticating mobile users to critical web services that demand a high level of security. As the smartphones are increasingly gaining popularity nowadays, software-based OTP generators have been developed and installed into smartphones as software apps, which bring great convenience to the users without introducing extra burden. However, software-based OTP solutions cannot guarantee the confidentiality of the generated passwords or even the seeds when the mobile OS is compromised. Moreover, they also suffer from denial-of-service attacks when the mobile OS crashes.

Truspy: Cache side-channel information leakage from the secure world on arm devices,"Ning Zhang, Kun Sun, Deborah Shands, Wenjing Lou, Y Thomas Hou",2016,Journal Cryptology ePrint Archive,"As smart, embedded devices are increasingly integrated into our daily life, the security of these devices has become a major concern. The ARM processor family, which powers more than 60% of embedded devices, introduced TrustZone technology to offer security protection via an isolated execution environment called secure world. Caches in TrustZone-enabled processors are extended with a non-secure (NS) bit to indicate whether a cache line is used by the secure world or the normal world. This cache design improves system performance by eliminating the need to perform cache flush during world switches; however, it also enables cache contention between the two worlds. In this work, we present TruSpy, the first study of timingbased cache side-channel information leakage of TrustZone. Our proposed attack exploits the cache contention between normal world and secure world to recover secret information from secure world. Two attacks are proposed in TruSpy, namely, the normal world OS attack and the normal world Android app attack. In the OS-based attack, the attacker is able to access virtual-to-physical address translation and high precision timers. In the Android app-based attack, these tools are unavailable to the attacker, so we devise a novel method that uses the expected channel statistics to allocate memory for cache probing. We also show how an attacker might use the less accurate performance event interface as a timer. Using the T-table based AES implementation in OpenSSL 1.0. 1f as an example, we demonstrate that it is possible for a normal world attacker to steal a fine-grained secret from the secure world using a …",120
Case: Cache-assisted secure execution on arm processors,"Ning Zhang, Kun Sun, Wenjing Lou, Y Thomas Hou",2016/5/22,Conference 2016 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),"Recognizing the pressing demands to secure embedded applications, ARM TrustZone has been adopted in both academic research and commercial products to protect sensitive code and data in a privileged, isolated execution environment. However, the design of TrustZone cannot prevent physical memory disclosure attacks such as cold boot attack from gaining unrestricted read access to the sensitive contents in the dynamic random access memory (DRAM). A number of system-on-chip (SoC) bound execution solutions have been proposed to thaw the cold boot attack by storing sensitive data only in CPU registers, CPU cache or internal RAM. However, when the operating system, which is responsible for creating and maintaining the SoC-bound execution environment, is compromised, all the sensitive data is leaked.

DeepDroid: Dynamically Enforcing Enterprise Policy on Android Devices.,"Xueqiang Wang, Kun Sun, Yuewu Wang, Jiwu Jing",2015/2/8,Conference Ndss,"It is becoming a global trend for company employees equipped with mobile devices to access company’s assets. Besides enterprise apps, lots of personal apps from various untrusted app stores may also be installed on those devices. To secure the business environment, policy enforcement on what, how, and when certain apps can access system resources is required by enterprise IT. However, Android, the largest mobile platform with a market share of 81.9%, provides very restricted interfaces for enterprise policy enforcement. In this paper, we present DeepDroid, a dynamic enterprise security policy enforcement scheme on Android devices. Different from existing approaches, DeepDroid is implemented by dynamic memory instrumentation of a small number of critical system processes without any firmware modification. DeepDroid can be easily deployed on various smartphone platforms with a wide range of Android versions. Moreover, based on the context information extracted from Binder interception, a fine-grained policy can be enforced. We develop a prototype of DeepDroid and test it on various smartphones and Android versions. The experimental results show that DeepDroid can effectively enforce enterprise resource access policies with negligible performance overhead.",115
Fault-tolerant cluster-wise clock synchronization for wireless sensor networks,"Kun Sun, Peng Ning, Cliff Wang",2005/9/19,Journal IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,"Wireless sensor networks have received a lot of attention recently due to their wide applications, such as target tracking, environment monitoring, and scientific exploration in dangerous environments. It is usually necessary to have a cluster of sensor nodes share a common view of a local clock time, so that all these nodes can coordinate in some important applications, such as time slotted MAC protocols, power-saving protocols with sleep/listen modes, etc. However, all the clock synchronization techniques proposed for sensor networks assume benign environments; they cannot survive malicious attacks in hostile environments. Fault-tolerant clock synchronization techniques are potential candidates to address this problem. However, existing approaches are all resource consuming and suffer from message collisions in most of cases. This paper presents a novel fault-tolerant clock synchronization scheme for …",107
A study of personal information in human-chosen passwords and its security implications,"Yue Li, Haining Wang, Kun Sun",2016/4/10,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2016-The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications,"Though not recommended, Internet users often include parts of personal information in their passwords for easy memorization.

In this paper, we first dissect user passwords from a leaked dataset to investigate how and to what extent user personal information resides in a password. In particular, we extract the most popular password structures expressed by personal information and show the usage of personal information. Then we introduce a new metric called Coverage to quantify the correlation between passwords and personal information.

Trustice: Hardware-assisted isolated computing environments on mobile devices,"He Sun, Kun Sun, Yuewu Wang, Jiwu Jing, Haining Wang",2015/6/22,Conference 2015 45th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks,"Mobile devices have been widely used to process sensitive data and perform important transactions. It is a challenge to protect secure code from a malicious mobile OS. ARM TrustZone technology can protect secure code in a secure domain from an untrusted normal domain. However, since the attack surface of the secure domain will increase along with the size of secure code, it becomes arduous to negotiate with OEMs to get new secure code installed. We propose a novel TrustZone-based isolation framework named TrustICE to create isolated computing environments (ICEs) in the normal domain. TrustICE securely isolates the secure code in an ICE from an untrusted Rich OS in the normal domain. The trusted computing base (TCB) of TrustICE remains small and unchanged regardless of the amount of secure code being protected.

A Measurement Study on Linux Container Security: Attacks and Countermeasures,"Xin Lin, Yuewu Wang, Lingguang Lei, Jiwu Jing, Kun Sun, Quan Zhou",2018,Conference 2018 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC),"Linux container mechanism has attracted a lot of attention and is increasingly utilized to deploy industry applications. Though it is a consensus that the container mechanism is not secure due to the kernel-sharing property, it lacks a concrete and systematical evaluation on its security using real world exploits. In this paper, we collect an attack dataset including 223 exploits that are effective on the container platform, and classify them into different categories using a two-dimensional attack taxonomy. Then we evaluate the security of existing Linux container mechanism using 88 typical exploits filtered out from the dataset. We find 50 (56.82%) exploits can successfully launch attacks from inside the container with the default configuration. Since the privilege escalation exploits can completely disable the container protection mechanism, we conduct an in-depth analysis on these exploits. We find the kernel security …",98
Using hardware features for increased debugging transparency,"Fengwei Zhang, Kevin Leach, Angelos Stavrou, Haining Wang, Kun Sun",2015/5/17,Conference 2015 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,"With the rapid proliferation of malware attacks on the Internet, understanding these malicious behaviors plays a critical role in crafting effective defense. Advanced malware analysis relies on virtualization or emulation technology to run samples in a confined environment, and to analyze malicious activities by instrumenting code execution. However, virtual machines and emulators inevitably create artifacts in the execution environment, making these approaches vulnerable to detection or subversion. In this paper, we present MALT, a debugging framework that employs System Management Mode, a CPU mode in the x86 architecture, to transparently study armored malware. MALT does not depend on virtualization or emulation and thus is immune to threats targeting such environments. Our approach reduces the attack surface at the software level, and advances state-of-the-art debugging transparency. MALT …",92
Spectre: A dependable introspection framework via system management mode,"Fengwei Zhang, Kevin Leach, Kun Sun, Angelos Stavrou",2013/6/24,Conference 2013 43rd Annual IEEE/IFIP international conference on dependable systems and networks (DSN),"Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) systems have been widely adopted for malware detection and analysis.

DESIR: Decoy-enhanced seamless IP randomization,"Jianhua Sun, Kun Sun",2016/4/10,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2016-The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications,"Sophisticated adversaries usually initiate their attacks with a reconnaissance phase to discover exploitable vulnerabilities on the targeted networks and systems. To mitigate the effectiveness of persistent reconnaissance attacks, we develop a defensive mechanism that dynamically mutates network topology with a large number of decoys to invalidate the attacker's knowledge from network scanning. We combine the IP randomization technique with decoy techniques and solve two challenges, namely, service availability to legitimate users and service security against unauthorized users. First, our solution can minimize the probability of the real servers being identified and compromised by unauthorized users through deploying a large number of decoy nodes, which change their IP addresses along with the real servers to prolong the scanning time of the attackers. Second, our solution can ensure seamless …",67
The CrossPath Attack: Disrupting the SDN Control Channel via Shared Links,"Jiahao Cao, Qi Li, Renjie Xie, Kun Sun, Guofei Gu, Mingwei Xu, Yuan Yang",2019,Conference USENIX Security Symposium,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables network innovations with a centralized controller controlling the whole network through the control channel. Because the control channel delivers all network control traffic, its security and reliability are of great importance. For the first time in the literature, we propose the CrossPath attack that disrupts the SDN control channel by exploiting the shared links in paths of control traffic and data traffic. In this attack, crafted data traffic can implicitly disrupt the forwarding of control traffic in the shared links. As the data traffic does not enter the control channel, the attack is stealthy and cannot be easily perceived by the controller. In order to identify the target paths containing the shared links to attack, we develop a novel technique called adversarial path reconnaissance. Both theoretic analysis and experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency of identifying the target paths. We systematically study the impacts of the attack on various network applications in a real SDN testbed. Experiments show the attack significantly degrades the performance of existing network applications and causes serious network anomalies, eg, routing blackhole, flow table resetting, and even network-wide DoS.",61

Secureswitch: Bios-assisted isolation and switch between trusted and untrusted commodity oses,"Kun Sun, Jiang Wang, Fengwei Zhang, Angelos Stavrou",2012,Journal Proceedings of the 19th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium,"Protecting commodity systems running commercial Operating Systems (OSes) without significantly degrading performance or usability still remains an open problem. To make matters worse, the overall security depends on complex applications that perform multiple inter-dependent tasks with Internet-borne code. Recent research has shown the need for context-dependent trustworthy environments that can segregate different user activities to lower risk of cross-contamination and safeguard private information. In this paper, we introduce a novel BIOS-assisted mechanism for secure instantiation and management of trusted execution environments. A key design characteristic of our system is usability: the ability to quickly and securely switch between operating environments without requiring any specialized hardware or code modifications. Our aim is to eliminate any mutable, non-BIOS code sharing while securely reusing existing hardware: even when an untrusted environment is compromised, there is no potential for exfiltration or inference attacks. To safeguard against spoofing attacks, we can force the user to physically set a hardware switch, an action that cannot be reproduced by software. In addition, we provide visible indication to the user about the current running environment leveraging one of the front panel Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). In our prototype, the entire switching process takes approximately six seconds on average. This empowers users to frequently and seamlessly alternate between trusted and untrusted environments.",58

The proposed mechanism turns a classical attack mechanism - Sybil - into an effective defense mechanism, with legitimate nodes periodically changing their virtual identity in order to increase the uncertainty for the attacker. To preserve communication among legitimate nodes, we modify the network layer by introducing (i) a translation service for mapping virtual identities to real identities; (ii) a protocol for propagating updates of a node's virtual identity to all legitimate nodes; and (iii) a mechanism for legitimate nodes to securely join the network.

Effectiveness of IP address randomization in decoy-based moving target defense,"Andrew Clark, Kun Sun, Radha Poovendran",2013/12/10,Conference 52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,"In a decoy-based moving target defense (MTD), a computer network introduces a large number of virtual decoy nodes in order to prevent the adversary from locating and targeting real nodes. Since the decoys can eventually be identified and their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses blacklisted by the adversary, current MTD approaches suggest that the IP addresses of the real and decoy nodes should be randomly refreshed and reassigned over time. Refreshing and reassigning the IP addresses, however, disrupts services such as TCP/IP that rely on the IP address. We introduce an analytical approach to MTD and choosing the optimal randomization policy in order to minimize disruptions to system performance. Our approach consists of two components.

A self-shielding dynamic network architecture,"Justin Yackoski, Peng Xie, Harry Bullen, Jason Li, Kun Sun",2011/11/7,Conference 2011-MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference,"The current static nature of computer networks allows attackers to gather intelligence, perform planning, and then execute attacks at will.

TruSense can be launched from not only the normal world operating system but also a non-privileged user application. Without access to virtual-to-physical address mapping in user applications, we devise a novel method that uses the expected channel statistics to allocate memory for cache probing. We also show how an attacker might use the less accurate performance event …",33
Securing network access in wireless sensor networks,"Kun Sun, An Liu, Roger Xu, Peng Ning, Douglas Maughan",2009/3/16,Book Proceedings of the second ACM conference on Wireless network security,"In wireless sensor networks, it is critical to restrict the network access only to eligible sensor nodes, while messages from outsiders will not be forwarded in the networks.

Detecting “0-Day” Vulnerability: An Empirical Study of Secret Security Patch in OSS,"Xinda Wang, Kun Sun, Archer Batcheller, Sushil Jajodia",2019,Conference 49th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN),"Security patches in open source software (OSS) not only provide security fixes to identified vulnerabilities, but also make the vulnerable code public to the attackers. Therefore, armored attackers may misuse this information to launch N-day attacks on unpatched OSS versions. The best practice for preventing this type of N-day attacks is to keep upgrading the software to the latest version in no time. However, due to the concerns on reputation and easy software development management, software vendors may choose to secretly patch their vulnerabilities in a new version without reporting them to CVE or even providing any explicit description in their change logs. When those secretly patched vulnerabilities are being identified by armored attackers, they can be turned into powerful ""0-day"" attacks, which can be exploited to compromise not only unpatched version of the same software, but also similar types of OSS (e …",27

Amnesia: A bilateral generative password manager,"Luren Wang, Yue Li, Kun Sun",2016/6/27,Conference 2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS),"While numerous flaws have been recognized in using passwords as a method of authentication, passwords still remain the de-facto authentication standard in use today. Though password managers can ameliorate password fatigue, the vast majority of password managers require the user to choose and maintain a strong master password while offering little to no recourse in the event that the master password is compromised. The wide-application of cloud-based password managers congregate passwords in an encrypted database, which becomes an attractive target for attackers and also represents a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose Amnesia, a bilateral generative password manager that requires both the knowledge of the master password and the possession of the user's smartphone to generate website passwords for the user.

Reliable and trustworthy memory acquisition on smartphones,"He Sun, Kun Sun, Yuewu Wang, Jiwu Jing",2015/8/11,Journal IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,"With the wide usage of smartphones in our daily life, new malware is emerging to compromise the mobile OS and then steal or manipulate sensitive data from mobile applications. Forensic analysis tools demand a reliable and trustworthy memory acquisition of the operating systems running on the smartphones for further digital forensic analysis.

In this paper, we develop a TrustZone-based memory acquisition mechanism called TrustDump that is capable of reliably and securely obtaining the RAM memory and CPU registers of the mobile OS even if the OS has crashed or been compromised. TrustDump is isolated from the mobile OS by TrustZone.

We first identify a set of new security metrics. Then, we show how to collect simple security metrics from the computers in a sample network. Next, we use Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) mechanism to compose two sophisticated security metrics, Criticality and Security Score, which are critical to measure the security risk.

Off-path TCP exploits of the mixed IPID assignment,"Xuewei Feng, Chuanpu Fu, Qi Li, Kun Sun, Ke Xu",2020/10/30,Book Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"In this paper, we uncover a new off-path TCP hijacking attack that can be used to terminate victim TCP connections or inject forged data into victim TCP connections by manipulating the new mixed IPID assignment method, which is widely used in Linux kernel version 4.18 and beyond to help defend against TCP hijacking attacks. The attack has three steps. First, an off-path attacker can downgrade the IPID assignment for TCP packets from the more secure per-socket-based policy to the less secure hash-based policy, building a shared IPID counter that forms a side channel on the victim. Second, the attacker detects the presence of TCP connections by observing the shared IPID counter on the victim. Third, the attacker infers the sequence number and the acknowledgment number of the detected connection by observing the side channel of the shared IPID counter. Consequently, the attacker can completely hijack …",21

In this paper, we propose PmDroid to protect the data that is not under the scope of the ad network's permission set. PmDroid can block the data from being sent to advertising servers at the occurrence of permission violation in ad networks. Moreover, we utilize PmDroid to assess how serious the permission violation problem is in the ad networks. We first implement 53 sample apps using a single ad network library.

Vulnerability and risk analysis of two commercial browser and cloud based password managers,"Rui Zhao, Chuan Yue, Kun Sun",2013,Journal ASE Science Journal,"Web users are confronted with the daunting challenges of managing more and more passwords to protect their valuable assets on different online services. Password manager is one of the most popular solutions designed to address such challenges by saving users’ passwords and later auto-filling the login forms on behalf of users. All the major browser vendors have provided password manager as a built-in feature; third-party vendors have also provided many password managers. In this paper, we analyze the security of two very popular commercial password managers: LastPass and RoboForm. Both of them are Browser and Cloud based Password Managers (BCPMs), and both of them have millions of active users worldwide. We investigate the security design and implementation of these two BCPMs with the focus on their underlying cryptographic mechanisms. We identify several critical, high, and medium risk level vulnerabilities that could be exploited by different types of attackers to break the security of these two BCPMs. Moreover, we provide some general suggestions to help improve the security design of these and similar BCPMs. We hope our analysis and suggestions could also be valuable to other cloud-based data security products and research.",21

CapMan offers a mechanism for a per flow, distributed bandwidth control by all the participating nodes along multiple communication paths. By exchanging summary capability messages, each node can maintain a global view of the overall throughput of flows in the network, and then dynamically adjust local constraints to prevent potential DoS attacks against a specific node or the network. Our approach is capable of scalably curtailing sophisticated DoS attacks that target multi-path routing protocols, even in the case that both the initiator and the responder of a network flow are malicious insiders and collude to deprive the network of valuable resources.

When the differences in frequency domain are compensated: Understanding and defeating modulated replay attacks on automatic speech recognition,"Shu Wang, Jiahao Cao, Xu He, Kun Sun, Qi Li",2020/10/30,Book Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have been widely deployed in modern smart devices to provide convenient and diverse voice-controlled services. Since ASR systems are vulnerable to audio replay attacks that can spoof and mislead ASR systems, a number of defense systems have been proposed to identify replayed audio signals based on the speakers' unique acoustic features in the frequency domain. In this paper, we uncover a new type of replay attack called modulated replay attack, which can bypass the existing frequency domain based defense systems. The basic idea is to compensate for the frequency distortion of a given electronic speaker using an inverse filter that is customized to the speaker's transform characteristics. Our experiments on real smart devices confirm the modulated replay attacks can successfully escape the existing detection mechanisms that rely on identifying suspicious …",18
CyberMoat: Camouflaging Critical Server Infrastructures with Large Scale Decoy Farms,"Jianhua Sun, Kun Sun, Qi Li",2017,Conference IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),"Traditional deception-based cyber defenses often undertake reactive strategies that utilize decoy systems or services for attack detection and information gathering. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these defense mechanisms has been largely constrained by the low decoy fidelity, the poor scalability of decoy platform, and the static decoy configurations, which allow the attackers to identify and bypass the deployed decoys. In this paper, we develop a decoy-enhanced defense framework that can proactively protect critical servers against targeted remote attacks through deception. To achieve both high fidelity and good scalability, our system follows a hybrid architecture that separates lightweight yet versatile front-end proxies from back-end high-fidelity decoy servers. Moreover, our system can further invalidate the attackers' reconnaissance through dynamic proxy address shuffling. To guarantee service availability …",16

In this paper, we propose a scheme to allow users remotely assess the actually deployed data redundancy in the cloud storage without knowing the file layout information. Our layout-free scheme establishes response-time profiles for each different file placements, and uses these profiles to evaluate the level of deployed data redundancy. Our experimental results show the feasibility of our scheme on both an in-house cloud and a public cloud.",16

Email as a Master Key: Analyzing Account Recovery in the Wild,"Yue Li, Haining Wang, Kun Sun",2018,Conference IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM),"Account recovery (usually through a password reset) on many websites has mainly relied on accessibility to a registered email due to its favorable deployability and usability. However, it makes a user's online accounts vulnerable to a single point of failure when the registered email account is compromised. While previous research focuses on strengthening user passwords, the security risk imposed by email-based account recovery has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of mounting an email-based account recovery attack. Specifically, we examine the account authentication and recovery protocols in 239 traffic-heavy websites, confirming that most of them use emails for account recovery.

To prevent clouds from recovering users' keywords, researchers have proposed a number of solutions to protect either search patterns or access patterns. However, none of them can protect both access patterns and search patterns. Moreover, existing SSE schemes cannot work in the generic database setting that allows multiple users to write or read over encrypted documents.

Such information can help an adversary to identify valuable targets, know the possible presence of network defense, and thus schedule a battle plan for a later stage of an attack. We design deep learning based methods to accurately and efficiently fingerprint all SDN applications from mixed control traffic. To evaluate the feasibility of the attack, we collect massive traces of control traffic from a real SDN testbed running various applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate an adversary can accurately identify various SDN applications with a 95.4% accuracy on average.",14

PathMarker: Protecting Web Contents against Inside Crawlers,"Shengye Wan, Yue Li, Kun Sun",2019,Journal CyberSecurity,"Web crawlers have been misused for several malicious purposes such as downloading server data without permission from the website administrator. Moreover, armoured crawlers are evolving against new anti-crawler mechanisms in the arm races between crawler developers and crawler defenders. In this paper, based on one observation that normal users and malicious crawlers have different short-term and long-term download behaviours, we develop a new anti-crawler mechanism called PathMarker to detect and constrain persistent distributed crawlers. By adding a marker to each Uniform Resource Locator (URL), we can trace the page that leads to the access of this URL and the user identity who accesses this URL. With this supporting information, we can not only perform more accurate heuristic detection using the path related features, but also develop a Support Vector Machine based machine learning detection model to distinguish malicious crawlers from normal users via inspecting their different patterns of URL visiting paths and URL visiting timings. In addition to effectively detecting crawlers at the earliest stage, PathMarker can dramatically suppress the scraping efficiency of crawlers before they are detected. We deploy our approach on an online forum website, and the evaluation results show that PathMarker can quickly capture all 6 open-source and in-house crawlers, plus two external crawlers (i.e., Googlebots and Yahoo Slurp).",13
A dependability analysis of hardware-assisted polling integrity checking systems,"Jiang Wang, Kun Sun, Angelos Stavrou",2012/6/25,Conference IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2012),"Due to performance constraints, host intrusion detection defenses depend on event and polling-based tamper-proof mechanisms to detect security breaches. These defenses monitor the state of critical software components in an attempt to discover any deviations from a pristine or expected state. The rate and type of checks depend can be both periodic and event-based, for instance triggered by hardware events. In this paper, we demonstrate that all software and hardware-assisted defenses that analyze non-contiguous state to infer intrusions are fundamentally vulnerable to a new class of attacks, we call “evasion attacks”.

When Match Fields Do Not Need to Match: Buffered Packets Hijacking in SDN,"Jiahao Cao, Renjie Xie, Kun Sun, Qi Li, Guofei Gu, Mingwei Xu",2020,Conference Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS),"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) greatly meets the need in industry for programmable, agile, and dynamic networks by deploying diversified SDN applications on a centralized controller. However, SDN application ecosystem inevitably introduces new security threats since compromised or malicious applications can significantly disrupt network operations. Thus, a number of effective security enhancement systems have been developed to defend against potential attacks from SDN applications. In this paper, we identify a new vulnerability on flow rule installation in SDN, namely, buffered packet hijacking, which can be exploited by malicious applications to launch effective attacks bypassing all existing defense systems. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in that SDN systems do not check the inconsistency between buffer IDs and match fields when an application attempts to install flow rules. Thus, a malicious application can manipulate buffer IDs to hijack buffered packets even though they do not match any installed flow rules. We design effective attacks exploiting this vulnerability to disrupt all three SDN layers, ie, application layer, data plane layer, and control layer. First, by modifying buffered packets and resending them to controllers, a malicious application can poison other applications. Second, by manipulating forwarding behaviors of buffered packets, a malicious application can not only disrupt TCP connections of flows but also make flows bypass network security policies. Third, by copying massive buffered packets to controllers, a malicious application can saturate the bandwidth of SDN control channels and their computing …",11

{RapidPatch}: Firmware Hotpatching for {Real-Time} Embedded Devices,"Yi He, Zhenhua Zou, Kun Sun, Zhuotao Liu, Ke Xu, Qian Wang, Chao Shen, Zhi Wang, Qi Li",2022,Conference 31st USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 22),"Nowadays real-time embedded devices are becoming one main target of cyber attacks. A huge number of embedded devices equipped with outdated firmware are subject to various vulnerabilities, but they cannot be timely patched due to two main reasons. First, it is difficult for vendors who have various types of fragmented devices to generate patches for each type of device. Second, it is challenging to deploy patches on many embedded devices without restarting or halting real-time tasks, hindering the patch installation on devices (eg, industrial control devices) that have high availability requirements. In this paper, we present RapidPatch, a new hotpatching framework to facilitate patch propagation by installing generic patches without disrupting other tasks running on heterogeneous embedded devices. RapidPatch allows RTOS developers to directly release common patches for all downstream devices so that device maintainers can easily generate device-specific patches for different firmware. We utilize eBPF virtual machines to execute patches on resource-constrained embedded devices and develop three hotpatching strategies to support hotpatching for all major microcontroller (MCU) architectures. In particular, we propose two types of eBPF patches for different types of vulnerabilities and develop an eBPF patch verifier to ensure patch safety. We evaluate RapidPatch with major CVEs on four major RTOSes running on different embedded devices. We find that over 90% vulnerabilities can be hotpatched via RapidPatch.

However, our preliminary study shows that these approaches can only cover a small part of disclosed OSS vulnerabilities (about 12%-53%) even with manual assistance.",9
Netgator: Malware detection using program interactive challenges,"Brian Schulte, Haris Andrianakis, Kun Sun, Angelos Stavrou",2012/7/26,"Conference International Conference on Detection of Intrusions and Malware, and Vulnerability Assessment",Internet-borne threats have evolved from easy to detect denial of service attacks to zero-day exploits used for targeted exfiltration of data. Current intrusion detection systems cannot always keep-up with zero-day attacks and it is often the case that valuable data have already been communicated to an external party over an encrypted or plain text connection before the intrusion is detected.,9
Enhancing malware analysis sandboxes with emulated user behavior,"Songsong Liu, Pengbin Feng, Shu Wang, Kun Sun, Jiahao Cao",2022/4/1,Journal Computers & Security,"Cybersecurity teams have widely used malware analysis sandboxes to investigate the threat of malware. Correspondingly, armored malware adopts various anti-sandbox techniques to evade analysis, from simple environment-specific traits detection to complex real-user operation environment verification. Particularly, malware may identify sandbox environments by checking several system artifacts that are impacted by the accumulation of normal user activities, such as file accesses. It remains a challenge to defeat this type of anti-sandbox technique. In this paper, we design an emulation-based system called UBER to enhance malware analysis sandboxes. The core idea is to generate realistic system artifacts based on automatically derived user profile models. We solve two major challenges. First, we generate authentic system artifacts continuously to emulate the real-user behaviors. Second, we integrate the …",8

In practice, the timely application of security patches in downstream software is challenging. The main reason is that such patches do not explicitly indicate their security impacts in the documentation, which would be difficult to recognize for software maintainers and users. However, attackers can still identify these “secret” security patches by analyzing the source code and generate corresponding exploits to compromise not only unpatched versions of the current software, but also other similar software packages that may contain the same vulnerability due to code cloning or similar design/implementation logic. Therefore, it is critical to identify these secret security patches to enable timely fixes. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based …",8
A Scalable High Fidelity Decoy Framework against Sophisticated Cyber Attacks,"Jianhua Sun Sun, Songsong Liu, Kun Sun",2019,Conference 6th ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD),"Recent years have witnessed a surging trend of leveraging deception technique to detect and defeat sophisticated cyber attacks such as the advanced persistent threat. Deception typically employs a decoy network to entrap the attackers and divert the firepower away from the real protected assets. Unfortunately, existing decoy systems failed to achieve a balanced tradeoff between the decoy fidelity and scalability, which potentially undermines the effectiveness of attacker deception. In this paper, we propose a hybrid decoy architecture that separates lightweight front-end decoys from high-fidelity back-end decoy servers. To enhance the deception effectiveness, we introduce dynamics into the decoy system design to make the decoy a moving target, where the front-end decoys constrain attackers by transparently intercepting and forwarding the malicious commands to the heterogeneous back-end decoys for real …",8
Automated IoT Device Fingerprinting Through Encrypted Stream Classification,"Jianhua Sun, Kun Sun, Chris Shenefiel",2019,Conference International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (SecureComm),"The explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled a wide range of new applications and services.

Automated and accurate IoT device fingerprinting is a prerequisite step for realizing secure, reliable, and high-quality IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach for passive fingerprinting of IoT device types through automatic classification of encrypted IoT network flows.

Off-path TCP hijacking attacks via the side channel of downgraded IPID,"Xuewei Feng, Qi Li, Kun Sun, Chuanpu Fu, Ke Xu",2021/10/1,Journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,"In this paper, we uncover a new off-path TCP hijacking attack that can be used to terminate victim TCP connections or inject forged data into victim TCP connections by manipulating the new mixed IPID assignment method, which is widely used in Linux kernel version 4.18 and beyond. Our attack has three steps. First, an off-path attacker can downgrade the IPID assignment for TCP packets from the more secure per-socket-based policy to the less secure hash-based policy, thus building a shared IPID counter that forms a side channel in the victim. Second, the attacker detects the presence of TCP connections by observing the side channel of the shared IPID counter. Third, the attacker infers sequence and acknowledgment numbers of the detected connection by observing the side channel. Consequently, the attacker can completely hijack the connection, e.g., resetting the connection or poisoning the data stream …",7
SIEVE: Secure In-Vehicle Automatic Speech Recognition Systems.,"Shu Wang, Jiahao Cao, Kun Sun, Qi Li",2020/10,Conference RAID,"Driverless vehicles are becoming an irreversible trend in our daily lives, and humans can interact with cars through invehicle voice control systems. However, the automatic speech recognition (ASR) module in the voice control systems is vulnerable to adversarial voice commands, which may cause unexpected behaviors or even accidents in driverless cars. Due to the high demand on security insurance, it remains as a challenge to defend in-vehicle ASR systems against adversarial voice commands from various sources in a noisy driving environment. In this paper, we develop a secure in-vehicle ASR system called SIEVE, which can effectively distinguish voice commands issued from the driver, passengers, or electronic speakers in three steps. First, it filters out multiple-source voice commands from multiple vehicle speakers by leveraging an autocorrelation analysis. Second, it identifies if a single-source voice command is from humans or electronic speakers using a novel dual-domain detection method. Finally, it leverages the directions of voice sources to distinguish the voice of the driver from those of the passengers. We implement a prototype of SIEVE and perform a real-world study under different driving conditions. Experimental results show SIEVE can defeat various adversarial voice commands over in-vehicle ASR systems.",7

However, since previous secure world checking solutions require to suspend the entire rich OS, asynchronous introspection has not been widely adopted in the real world. Given a multi-core ARM system that can execute the two worlds simultaneously on different cores, secure world introspection can check the rich OS without suspension. However, we identify a new normal-world evasion attack that can defeat the asynchronous introspection by removing the attacking traces in parallel from one core when the security checking is performing on another core.

On Feasibility of Fingerprinting Wireless Sensor Nodes Using Physical Properties,"Xiaowei Mei, Donggang Liu, Kun Sun, Xu Dingbang",2013/5,Conference IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS),"Fingerprinting wireless devices using physical properties has been recently suggested as an alternative for device identification and authentication. It has been found that the clock skew caused by the frequency discrepancy of the quartz crystals in different devices can be used as a reliable source for fingerprinting. Researchers have studied the application of the clock skew-based fingerprinting in sensor networks and claimed that it can detect fake identities, wormholes, and node replicas. However, the study in this paper draws a completely opposite conclusion, i.e., the clock skew of sensor nodes can be easily forged by adversaries to evade the detection. This paper then studies the feasibility of using the distribution of signal power in space to fingerprint sensor nodes. The result shows that a sensor node's signal power distribution in space is not only reliable for being used as a source for fingerprinting but also …",7

An empirical study of secret security patch in open source software,"Xinda Wang, Kun Sun, Archer Batcheller, Sushil Jajodia",2020,Journal Adaptive Autonomous Secure Cyber Systems,"Security patches of Open Source Software (OSS) point out the vulnerable source code and provide security fixes, which can be misused by attackers to generate exploits as N-day attacks. Though the best practice for defending this type of N-day attacks is to timely patch the software, it becomes a challenge considering that a system may bundle multiple OSS with a large number of patches including security fixes, bug fixes, and new features. Even worse, software vendors may secretly patch their vulnerabilities without reporting to CVE or providing any explicit descriptions in change logs. Hence, armored attackers may compromise not only unpatched versions of the same software, but also other software with similar functionalities due to code clone or similar logic.

However, state-of-the-art cloud based password managers are vulnerable to data breach and a master password becomes a single point of failure. To address these security vulnerabilities, we propose BluePass, a password manager that stores the password vault (i.e., the set of all the encrypted site passwords of a user) locally in a mobile device and a decryption key to the vault in the user computer.

Proof of isolation for cloud storage,"Zhan Wang, Kun Sun, Sushil Jajodia, Jiwu Jing",2014,Journal Secure Cloud Computing,"Cloud services help users reduce operational costs by sharing the hardware resources across multiple tenants.

Cloud service providers have proposed to mitigate these concerns by offering physically isolated resources; however, cloud users have no ways to verify the actual configuration and level of the resource isolation. To increase the observability of disk storage isolation, we introduce two Proof of Isolation (PoI) schemes that enable cloud users to verify separated disk storage and dedicated disk storage, respectively.

{Off-Path} Network Traffic Manipulation via Revitalized {ICMP} Redirect Attacks,"Xuewei Feng, Qi Li, Kun Sun, Zhiyun Qian, Gang Zhao, Xiaohui Kuang, Chuanpu Fu, Ke Xu",2022,Conference 31st USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 22),"ICMP redirect is a mechanism that allows an end host to dynamically update its routing decisions for particular destinations. Previous studies show that ICMP redirect may be exploited by attackers to manipulate the routing of victim traffic. However, it is widely believed that ICMP redirect attacks are not a real-world threat since they can only occur under specific network topologies (eg, LAN). In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the legitimacy check mechanism of ICMP and uncover a fundamental gap between the check mechanism and stateless protocols, resulting in a wide range of vulnerabilities. In particular, we find that off-path attackers can utilize a suite of stateless protocols (eg, UDP, ICMP, GRE, IPIP and SIT) to easily craft evasive ICMP error messages, thus revitalizing ICMP redirect attacks to cause serious damage in the real world, particularly, on the wide-area network. First, we show that off-path attackers can conduct a stealthy DoS attack by tricking various public servers on the Internet into mis-redirecting their traffic into black holes with a single forged ICMP redirect message. For example, we reveal that more than 43K popular websites on the Internet are vulnerable to this DoS attack. In addition, we identify 54.47 K open DNS resolvers and 186 Tor nodes on the Internet are vulnerable as well. Second, we show that, by leveraging ICMP redirect attacks against NATed networks, off-path attackers in the same NATed network can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept the victim traffic. Finally, we develop countermeasures to throttle the attacks.",4

However, evaluating ML data typically requires the cloud to access a shopper’s ML model and sellers’ data, which are both sensitive. None of the existing cloud-based data marketplaces enable ML data evaluation while preserving both model privacy and data privacy.

For the first time in the literature, we propose the CrossPath attack that disrupts the SDN control channel by exploiting the shared links in paths of control traffic and data traffic. In this attack, crafted data traffic can implicitly disrupt the forwarding of control traffic in the shared links. As the data traffic does not enter the control channel, the attack is stealthy and cannot be easily perceived by the controller. In order to identify the target paths containing the shared links to attack, we develop a novel technique called adversarial path reconnaissance.

Exploring the Unchartered Space of Container Registry Typosquatting,"Guannan Liu, Xing Gao, Haining Wang, Kun Sun",2022,Conference 31st USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 22),"With the increasing popularity of containerized applications, container registries have hosted millions of repositories that allow developers to store, manage, and share their software. Unfortunately, they have also become a hotbed for adversaries to spread malicious images to the public. In this paper, we present the first in-depth study on the vulnerability of container registries to typosquatting attacks, in which adversaries intentionally upload malicious images with an identification similar to that of a benign image so that users may accidentally download malicious images due to typos. We demonstrate that such typosquatting attacks could pose a serious security threat in both public and private registries as well as across multiple platforms. To shed light on the container registry typosquatting threat, we first conduct a measurement study and a 210-day proof-of-concept exploitation on public container registries, revealing that human users indeed make random typos and download unwanted container images. We also systematically investigate attack vectors on private registries and reveal that its naming space is open and could be easily exploited for launching a typosquatting attack. In addition, for a typosquatting attack across multiple platforms, we demonstrate that adversaries can easily self-host malicious registries or exploit existing container registries to manipulate repositories with similar identifications. Finally, we propose CRYSTAL, a lightweight extension to existing image management, which effectively defends against typosquatting attacks from both container users and registries.",3
Towards a Believable Decoy System: Replaying Network Activities from Real System,"Jianhua Sun, Kun Sun, Qi Li",2020/6/29,Conference 2020 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),"Recently cyber deception has emerged as a promising defense approach for detecting and defeating advanced persistent threat. By leveraging deceptive decoys, the defenders seek to proactively engage with the attackers and entice them away from the protected server infrastructure. The effectiveness of such decoy-based deception largely relies on the decoy fidelity.

Accordingly, we identify two deception evasion attacks, namely, traffic fingerprinting and system fingerprinting, which enable sophisticated adversaries to accurately distinguish decoys from real servers.

Several approaches have been proposed for secure data dissemination while adopting forward error correction techniques (e.g., erasure codes) for efficiency. In particular, an approach named LR-Seluge was proposed to achieve efficient, secure data dissemination by integrating erasure codes into Seluge, a previous solution for secure data dissemination in WSNs. However, despite its efficiency in reducing the number of packet transmissions, LR-Seluge still introduces long dissemination delays.",3
TerraCheck: Verification of Dedicated Cloud Storage,"Zhan Wang, Kun Sun, Sushil Jajodia, Jiwu Jing",2013,"Conference Data and Applications Security and Privacy XXVII: 27th Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Conference, DBSec 2013, Newark, NJ, USA, July 15-17, 2013. Proceedings 27","When hardware resources are shared between mutually distrustful tenants in the cloud, it may cause information leakage and bring difficulties to regulatory control. To address these concerns, cloud providers are starting to offer hardware resources dedicated to a single user. Cloud users have to pay more for such dedicated tenancy; however, they may not be able to detect the unexpected misuse of their dedicated storage due to the abstraction layer of the cloud. In this paper, we propose TerraCheck to help cloud users verify if their dedicated storage devices have been misused to store other users’ data. TerraCheck detects the malicious occupation of the dedicated device by monitoring the change of the shadow data that are residual bits intentionally left on the disk and are invisible by the file system. When the cloud providers share the dedicated disk with other users, such misuses can be detected since …",3
The Attack: Overflowing SDN Flow Tables at a Low Rate,"Jiahao Cao, Mingwei Xu, Qi Li, Kun Sun, Yuan Yang",2022/12/1,Journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,"The emerging Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is being adopted by data centers and cloud service providers to enable flexible control. Meanwhile, the current SDN design brings new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we explore a stealthy attack that uses a minimum rate of attack packets to disrupt SDN data plane. To achieve this, we propose the LOFT attack that computes the lower bound of attack rate to overflow flow tables based on the inferred network configurations. Particularly, each attack packet always triggers or maintains consumption of one flow rule. LOFT can ensure the attack effect under various network configurations while reducing the possibility of being captured. We demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness in a real SDN testbed consisting of commercial hardware switches. The experimental results show that LOFT incurs significant network performance degradation and potential network DoS at …",2

Traditionally, the existing solutions extract syntactic, structural, and semantic features from disassembled programs and employ machine learning techniques to identify the compilation provenance of binaries. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on disassembly tools (e.g., IDA Pro) and tedious feature engineering, since it is challenging to obtain accurate assembly code, particularly, from the stripped or obfuscated binaries. In addition, the features in machine learning approaches are manually selected based on the domain knowledge of one specific architecture, which cannot be applied to other architectures.

Understanding the Practice of Security Patch Management across Multiple Branches in OSS Projects,"Xin Tan, Yuan Zhang, Jiajun Cao, Kun Sun, Mi Zhang, Min Yang",2022/4/25,Book Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022," Since the users of open source software (OSS) projects may not use the latest version all the time, OSS development teams often support code maintenance for old versions through maintaining multiple stable branches. Typically, the developers create a stable branch for each old stable version, deploy security patches on the branch, and release fixed versions at regular intervals. As such, old-version applications in production environments are protected from the disclosed vulnerabilities in a long time. However, the rapidly growing number of OSS vulnerabilities has greatly strained this patch deployment model, and a critical need has arisen for the security community to understand the practice of security patch management across stable branches. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of stable branches in OSS projects and the security patches deployed on them via investigating 608 stable …",2
User input enrichment via sensing devices,"Yutao Tang, Yue Li, Qun Li, Kun Sun, Haining Wang, Zhengrui Qin",2021/9/4,Journal Computer Networks,"Nowadays a user may have many electronic devices. However, these devices suffer from different resource and usage constraints. On one hand, mobile devices, such as smartphones, have short battery life, limited computing power, and small-sized display. On the other hand, more powerful devices such as desktops or smart TVs are bulky and lack motion-related input data. In this paper, we aim to integrate these two types of devices into one computing platform when both devices are accessible to a user, in which their individual advantages are combined for users’ convenience. To this end, we develop a new user-centric paradigm on computing systems, called Application Execution with Sensing Input (AESIP), which can transparently inject sensing data to a powerful yet stationary device using an auxiliary mobile device. Not requiring any modification on the mobile device’s OS and applications, AESIP supports …",2

While previous research focuses on strengthening user passwords, the security risk imposed by email-based password recovery has not yet been well studied. In this article, we first conduct a measurement study to characterize the password recovery activities in the wild. Specifically, we examine the authentication and password recovery protocols from 239 traffic-heavy websites, confirming that most of them use emails for password recovery.

Most of the encryption-based approaches for providing privacy incurs substantial overheads. However, in many instances, only part of data information needs to be protected, and the level of privacy is often dependent on the application requirements. Various types of image filtering techniques are utilized to generate distorted DNN datasets with application-specific privacy requirements satisfied.

Vulnerable Service Invocation and Countermeasures,"Huan Chang, Lingguang Lei, Kun Sun, Yuewu Wang, Jiwu Jing, Yi He, Pingjian Wang",2019,Journal IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC),"Before Android 5.0, the services in Android applications can be invoked either explicitly or implicitly.

Man-in-the-Middle Attacks without Rogue AP: When WPAs Meet ICMP Redirects,"Xuewei Feng, Qi Li, Kun Sun, Yuxiang Yang, Ke Xu",2022/10/6,Conference 2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),"Modern Wi-Fi networks are commonly protected by the security mechanisms, eg, WPA, WPA2 or WPA3, and thus it is difficult for an attacker (a malicious supplicant) to hijack the traffic of other supplicants as a man-in-the-middle (MITM). In traditional Evil Twins attacks, attackers may deploy a bogus wireless access point (AP) to hijack the victim supplicants’ traffic (eg, stealing credentials). In this paper, we uncover a new MITM attack that can evade the security mechanisms in Wi-Fi networks by spoofing the legitimate AP to send a forged ICMP redirect message to a victim supplicant and thus allow attackers to stealthily hijack the traffic from the victim supplicant without deploying any bogus AP. The core idea is to misuse the vulnerability of cross-layer interactions between WPAs and ICMP protocols, totally evading the link layer security mechanisms enforced by WPAs. We resolve two requirements to successfully launch our attack. First, when the attacker spoofs the legitimate AP to craft an ICMP redirect message, the legitimate AP cannot recognize and filter out those forged ICMP redirect messages. We uncover a new vulnerability (CVE-2022-25667) of the Network Processing Units (NPUs) in AP routers that restrict the AP routers from blocking fake ICMP error messages passing through the router. We test 55 popular wireless routers from 10 well-known AP vendors, and none of these routers can block the forged ICMP redirect messages due to this vulnerability.

To monitor and analyze webshell-based command injection, we develop a hybrid webshell honeypot framework called HoneyBog, which intercepts and redirects malicious injected commands from the front-end honeypot to the high-fidelity back-end honeypot for execution.

To address these security vulnerabilities, we propose BluePass, a password manager that stores the password vault (ie, the set of all the encrypted site passwords of a user) locally in a mobile device and a decryption key to the vault in the user computer. BluePass partially inherits the security characteristics of two-factor authentication by requiring both a mobile device and a master password to retrieve and decrypt the site passwords.

GraphSPD: Graph-Based Security Patch Detection with Enriched Code Semantics,"Shu Wang, Xinda Wang, Kun Sun, Sushil Jajodia, Haining Wang, Qi Li",2022/10/6,Conference 2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),"With the increasing popularity of open-source software, embedded vulnerabilities have been widely propagating to downstream software. Due to different maintenance policies, software vendors may silently release security patches without providing sufficient advisories (eg, CVE). This leaves users unaware of security patches and provides attackers good chances to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities. Thus, detecting those silent security patches becomes imperative for secure software maintenance. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network based security patch detection system named GraphSPD, which represents patches as graphs with richer semantics and utilizes a patch-tailored graph model for detection. We first develop a novel graph structure called PatchCPG to represent software patches by merging two code property graphs (CPGs) for the pre-patch and post-patch source code as well as retaining the context, deleted, and added components for the patch. By applying a slicing technique, we retain the most relevant context and reduce the size of PatchCPG. Then, we develop the first end-to-end deep learning model called PatchGNN to determine if a patch is security-related directly from its graphstructured PatchCPG. PatchGNN includes a new embedding process to convert PatchCPG into a numeric format and a new multi-attributed graph convolution mechanism to adapt diverse relationships in PatchCPG. The experimental results show GraphSPD can significantly outperform the state-of-theart approaches on security patch detection.",

UTrack: Enterprise User Tracking Based on OS-Level Audit Logs,"Yue Li, Zhenyu Wu, Haining Wang, Kun Sun, Zhichun Li, Kangkook Jee, Junghwan Rhee, Haifeng Chen",2021/4/26,Book Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,"Tracking user activities inside an enterprise network has been a fundamental building block for today's security infrastructure, as it provides accurate user profiling and helps security auditors to make informed decisions based on the derived insights from the abundant log data. Towards more accurate user tracking, we propose a novel paradigm named UTrack by leveraging rich system-level audit logs. From a holistic perspective, we bridge the semantic gap between user accounts and real users, tracking a real user's activities across different user accounts and different network hosts based on causal relationship among processes. To achieve better scalability and a more salient view, we apply a variety of data reduction and compression techniques to process the large amount of data. %and significantly reduce the data volume. We implement UTrack in a real enterprise environment consisting of 111 hosts, which …",
TrustICT: an efficient trusted interaction interface between isolated execution domains on ARM multi-core processors,"Jie Wang, Yuewu Wang, Lingguang Lei, Kun Sun, Jiwu Jing, Quan Zhou",2020/11/16,Book Proceedings of the 18th Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,"The Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) has been widely used to protect the security-sensitive sensing systems on Internet-of-Thing (IoT) devices. In the TEE systems, the execution environment is securely divided into a normal domain and a higher privileged secure domain which executing sensing systems through hardware. One common way to achieve the protection is implementing the sensitive functions of the sensing systems as trusted applications (TAs) in the well-isolated secure domain. Users in rich OS have to call TAs through the client applications (CAs), and the invocations must pass through the rich OS kernel. However, an untrusted rich OS may launch man-in-the-middle attacks on the communication between the CAs and TAs, and the misuse of cross-domain communication channel is becoming one severe threat on the TEE systems. In this paper, we develop a defense system named TrustICT to …",
An Infrastructure for Deploying and Testing Comprehensive Cyber Situational Awareness Solutions,"Sushil Jajodia, Kun Sun, Massimiliano Albanese",2019/4/16,Publisher George Mason University Fairfax United States,"Major Goals Under the ARO funded MURI project entitled Computer-Aided Human Centric Cyber Situation Awareness, we at George Mason University developed an integrated Cyber Situation Awareness CSA solution to support cyber security analysts and fill the semantic gap between available monitoring data and the analysts mental processes. The comprehensive CSA framework we defined has the capability of automatically answering a number of questions that analysts may ask about current situation, impact and evolution of attacks, behavior of attackers, quality of available information and models, and possible future attacks. With this DURIP award, our goal was to build a computing infrastructure that includes i highly available servers for deploying the monitoring systems and the novel components of the framework ii redundant storage to reliably maintain all relevant information and data structures and ii analyst workstations equipped with multiple large displays. This infrastructure was fundamental to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by allowing the large scale implementation needed to thoroughly vet the proposed framework and direct our research and development towards demonstrating enterprise-wide scalability of our solutions. This infrastructure enabled us to realistically assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach and get valuable feedback from analysts. Additionally, it provided our students with the opportunity to gain valuable hands-on experience. Accomplishments We used the equipment acquired through this grant to build an infrastructure for deploying our CSA framework and test its scalability. While a …",
CADET: Investigating a Collaborative and Distributed Entropy Transfer Protocol,"Kyle Wallace, Gang Zhou, Kun Sun",2018,Conference IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS),"The generation of random numbers has traditionally been a task confined to the bounds of a single piece of hardware. However, with the rapid growth and proliferation of resource-constrained devices in the Internet of Things (IoT), standard methods of generating randomness encounter barriers that can limit their effectiveness. In this work, we explore the design, implementation, and efficacy of a Collaborative and Distributed Entropy Transfer protocol (CADET), which aims to move random number generation from an individual task to a collaborative one. Through the sharing of excess random data, devices that are unable to meet their own needs can be aided by contributions from other devices. We implement and test a proof-of-concept version of CADET on a testbed of 49 Raspberry Pi 3B single-board computers, which have been underclocked to emulate the resource constraints of IoT devices. Through this, we …",
Design and Implementation of Decoy Enhanced Dynamic Virtualization Networks,Kun Sun,2016/12/12,"Publisher The College of William and Mary, Office of Sponsored Programs Williamsburg United States","Sophisticated adversaries usually initiate their attacks with a reconnaissance phase to discover exploitable vulnerabilities on the targeted networks and systems. This attacking strategy works well due to the static nature of the network topology. To mitigate the effectiveness of reconnaissance attacks, we propose to develop a defensive mechanism that dynamically mutates network topology with a large number of decoys to invalidate the attackers knowledge from network scanning. In this work, we focus on solving two major challenges associated with dynamic network topology, namely, service availability to legitimate users and service security against unauthorized users.",
Cyber Moat: adaptive virtualized network framework for deception and disinformation,Kun Sun,2016/12/12,"Publisher The College of William and Mary, Office of Sponsored Programs Williamsburg United States","Given limited resources including CPU cycles, memory, disk storage and network bandwidth, we will design a scalable decoy system that can not only minimize resource usage ie a large number of decoys can be deployed simultaneously, but also provide effective protection for the real system. In general, there are three design goals of our decoy system scalability, fidelity, and isolation. This project will develop a set of optimized, validated, and fully documented algorithms andmechanisms. A successful system prototype will be delivered and lead to a powerful new capability for using moving target defense mechanism to build resilient, adaptive, and secure systems.",
◾ Cloud Security Key Management: Cloud User Controls,"Weiyu Jiang, Jingqiang Lin, Zhan Wang, Bo Chen, Kun Sun",2016/9/19,Book Cloud Computing Security,"In addition, applying key-enforced access control to  soware as a service remains a challenge. For  example,  the collaborative editing service (e.g., Google Docs, Oce  Online, and Cloud9) has become a popular and convenient choice for online users. With such a service, a group  of users can cooperatively edit documents through the  Internet; in particular, they can concurrently modify the  same document, even write on the same line. Meanwhile,  the collaborative editing cloud service provides consistent views to all clients in a timely manner; for example,  if each of two independent users concurrently inserts one  character into the same line that is displayed identically  on their own screens, all users will immediately see both  of these characters appear in the expected positions.",
Host immunity via mutable virtualized large-scale network containers,Kun Sun,2016/7/25,Publisher The College of William and Mary Williamsburg United States,"The relatively static configurations of networks and their hosts allow attackers to gather intelligence, perform planning, and execute attacks at will. We propose a scalable, dynamic, adaptive system for host immunity that combines virtualization, emulation, and mutable network configurations. This system is deployed on a single host, and provides host protection through hiding the real system among a large number of decoys with dynamic virtualized network topology. It will make the network scanner and intruder spend more time and effort on attacking the worthless targets decoys.",
Multi‐source broadcast authentication with Combined Key Chain s for wireless ad hoc networks,"Seonho Choi, Kun Sun, Hyeonsang Eom, Edward Jung",2015/5/10,Journal Security and Communication Networks,"Multiple trust sources may be needed for broadcast in wireless ad hoc networks. For example, multiple base stations may be employed in some wireless sensor networks, or multiple trusts may be distributed among multiple routing nodes in multi‐hop routing protocol. Most of the previously proposed multicast/broadcast authentication protocols assume a single source of trust. With multiple trust sources, it becomes difficult to design resource‐efficient authentication protocols for multicast/broadcast services. Simply extending traditional approaches will result in increased bandwidth and memory consumptions in proportion to the number of trust sources.",
