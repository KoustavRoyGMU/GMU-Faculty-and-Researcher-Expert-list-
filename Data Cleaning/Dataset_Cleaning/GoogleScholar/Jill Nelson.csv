Signal processing for underwater acoustic communications,"Andrew C Singer, Jill K Nelson, Suleyman S Kozat",2009/1,Journal IEEE Communications Magazine,"The performance and complexity of signal processing systems for underwater acoustic communications has dramatically increased over the last two decades. With its origins in noncoherent modulation and detection for communication at rates under 100 b/s, phase-coherent digital communication systems employing multichannel adaptive equalization with explicit symbol-timing and phase tracking are being deployed in commercial and military systems, enabling rates in excess of 10 kb/s. Research systems have been shown to further dramatically increase performance through the use of spatial multiplexing. Iterative equalization and decoding has also proven to be an enabling technology for dramatically enhancing the robustness of such systems. This article provides a brief overview of signal processing methods and advances in underwater acoustic communications, discussing both single carrier and emerging …",306
BAD: bidirectional arbitrated decision-feedback equalization,"JK Nelson, Andrew C Singer, Upamanyu Madhow, CS McGahey",2005/3/7,Journal IEEE Transactions on Communications,"The bidirectional arbitrated decision-feedback equalizer (BAD), which has bit-error rate performance between a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection, is presented. The computational complexity of the BAD algorithm is linear in the channel length, which is the same as that of the DFE, and significantly lower than the exponential complexity of the MAP detector. While the relative performance of BAD to those of the DFE and the MAP detector depends on the specific channel model, for an error probability of 10/sup -2/, the performance of BAD is typically 1-2 dB better than that of the DFE, and within 1 dB of the performance of MAP detection.",69

In the use of conventional machine learning algorithms, feature selection is a fundamental difficulty given the large number of possible features and the small amount of available data. In this study, we bypass the challenges of feature selection and investigate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying workload memory tasks. CNNs are well suited for learning from the raw data without any a priori feature selection. CNNs take as input two-dimensional images, which differ in structure from the neural time series obtained on the scalp surface using EEG and fNIRS. Therefore, both the existing CNN architectures and fNIRS-EEG input must be adapted to allow fNIRS-EEG input to a CNN. In this …",46
Global optimization for multiple transmitter localization,"Jill K Nelson, Megan U Hazen, Maya R Gupta",2006/10/23,Conference MILCOM 2006-2006 IEEE Military Communications conference,"We propose a global optimization approach to locating multiple transmitters within a geographic area. A set of sensor nodes are assumed to be present in the region and to measure total power received at their respective locations. These measurements are communicated to a processing node, which uses particle swarm optimization to find the transmitter locations that minimize the difference between the true received power and the estimated power based on the chosen propagation model. Clustering is used to generate initial estimates of the transmitter locations, thereby increasing the likelihood that the particle-based optimizer reaches the global minimum. Simulation results show that global optimization is an effective method for multiple transmitter localization and that generating ""smart"" initial conditions via clustering can yield an average performance improvement of over 25% compared to random initial …",36

Multiple transmitter localization is of interest for uncoordinated cognitive radio systems, which must identify and transmit over unused radio spectrum without cooperation from conventional transmitters. We employ the EM algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the maximum-likelihood estimation problem. Because the EM algorithm finds only a locally optimal solution, we explore the use of clustering to generate ""smart"" initial estimates of the transmitter locations. Simulation results show that, as the number of sensors increases, the proposed EM technique achieves gains of up to an order of magnitude over constricted particle swarm optimization, a popular global optimization technique.",34

This problem is motivated by the search for available spectrum in cognitive radio applications. We create a quasi expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for localization under lognormal shadowing. Simulated performance is compared to random guessing and to global optimization using constriction particle swarm (CPSO). Results show that the proposed quasi EM algorithm outperforms both alternatives given a fixed number of guesses, and the performance gap grows as the number of transmitters increases.",33

"Comparing student understanding of signals and systems using a concept inventory, a traditional exam and interviews","John R Buck, Kathleen E Wage, Margret A Hjalmarson, Jill K Nelson",2007/10/10,"Conference 2007 37th annual frontiers in education conference-global engineering: knowledge without borders, opportunities without passports","Concept inventories play a growing role in assessing student understanding in engineering curricula. A common application of concept inventories is a pre/post- test assessment in a course. For this reason, it is important to confirm the validity of any new concept inventory, i.e., to verify that the inventory measures what it is designed to assess. The signals and systems concept inventory (SSCI) is a 25-question multiple-choice exam assessing core concepts in undergraduate signals and systems courses. This paper presents two analyses supporting the validity of the SSCI. The first analysis compares the responses of 40 students to final exam questions with their responses to related SSCI questions. This analysis finds statistically-significant correlations between the SSCI and the final exam for questions on convolution and Fourier transform properties.

However, recent studies have shown more robust classification results when EEG is combined with other neuroimaging methods such as fNIRS. Conventional classification methods need a priori feature preprocessing to train the model; such feature selection is a difficult and heavily studied problem. By using deep neural networks (DNN), in which recordings can be fed directly to the algorithm for training, we avoid the need for feature selection.

Self-Study as a Method for Engaging STEM Faculty in Transformative Change to Improve Teaching.,"Anastasia P Samaras, Margret Hjalmarson, Lori C Bland, Jill K Nelson, Emily K Christopher",2019,Journal International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education,"Reform efforts in the teaching of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have included introducing faculty to specific teaching strategies and engaging them in collaborative initiatives. This study examined the experiences of STEM faculty learning interactive teaching strategies while also learning and applying self-study methodology in a year-long faculty self-study learning community. We used self-study methodology as an innovative design to support STEM faculty's research about their teaching. Drawing on multiple sources of data, the researchers found that although participants reported that learning self-study methodology was unique and complex, they embraced the problematic and sophisticated nature of self-study to examine their teaching while recognizing the close link between teaching and research. As they reflected on their professional identities as teachers, they gained a better understanding of their role in their students' learning.",21

The multi-directional arbitrated DFE (MAD) exploits directional diversity to reduce the effects of error-propagation while maintaining complexity on the same order as a DFE.

A tree search approach to target tracking in clutter,"Jill K Nelson, Hossein Roufarshbaf",2009/7/6,Conference 2009 12th International Conference on Information Fusion,"A novel approach to target tracking using tree search techniques is presented. The tracking problem is framed as a generalized sequential detection problem in which every possible sequence of target states is mapped to a path through the search tree. The stack algorithm for depth-first tree search is then employed to navigate the tree and identify the most likely path, or equivalently the most likely sequence of target states, by extending a single promising path in each iteration. The tree-search tracking technique can be viewed as approximating the full Bayesian inference approach by computing the posterior distribution only in regions in which it has significant mass. Unlike approaches that build on Kalman filtering techniques, the proposed stack-based tracker suffers no performance loss in the presence of nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian motion and measurement models. Simulation results show that the stack …",15

Creating small interactive teaching development groups,"Margret Hjalmarson, Jill K Nelson",2014/6/15,Conference 2014 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"Creating Small Interactive Teaching Development GroupsThere has been a long-standing gap between research about interactive teaching strategiesand the implementation of those strategies in classrooms. Interactive teaching, for ourpurposes, can include almost any strategy that can support instructors shifting from onlylecturing toward including more active participation in class sessions. For example, having students solve problems in class is a strategy increasing in prominence with theadvent of the “flipped” classroom. We recognize that these shifts in format may bechallenging for instructors who do not have models for interactive instruction in theirown background. In addition, it is challenging to know where to start when creating amore interactive classroom even when the benefits may be evident in terms of students’ learning and overall experience. It is especially difficult without support from colleaguesin the department who can share their successes and challenges with interactive teaching.

"Interdisciplinary design: The good, the bad, and the ugly","Jill Nelson, Brent Nuttall, Allen Estes",2010,Journal 2010 Annual Conference & Exposition Proceedings,"Today’s students are faced with far different challenges upon graduation than those encountered in past years. One of the most significant of these challenges is the need to work within the framework of integrated project delivery where all disciplines work as a cohesive team to produce a project. In 2004, the Construction Management Department at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, CA began teaching a three credit hour design/build course focused on integrated project delivery. That course, taught primarily to construction management students, has now evolved into a true interdisciplinary experience that is taught in a team environment by professors from the departments of Construction Management, Architecture, and Architectural Engineering. The challenges in creating and executing such a course are immense and fall into three major areas; institutional, logistical and pedagogical. This paper addresses these three challenge areas by discussing the specific issues, both good and bad, associated with this course and how they were addressed. It includes assessment data from the course and cites some areas for improvement.

To help students draw strong connections between the theory and practice of DSP, we propose replacing weekly problem sets with four larger-scale projects. Each project is based on a real-world application of DSP and is designed to incorporate a subset of the core concepts covered in the course. In addition to theoretical components, the projects include hands-on MATLAB elements. We hypothesize that employing application-based projects rather than conventional problem sets will improve students' understanding of fundamental DSP concepts and their ability to make connections between theory and practice. The success of the project-based assignments will be evaluated by administering the Signals and Systems Concept Inventory, as well as a student survey",10
Efficient soft-input soft-output MIMO detection via improved M-algorithm,"Jun Won Choi, Byonghyo Shim, Jill K Nelson, Andrew C Singer",2010/5/23,Conference 2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications,"In this paper, we propose a new soft-input soft-output (SISO) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) detection technique, called an improved SISO M-algorithm (ISS-MA). We modify the conventional M-algorithm to improve the performance-complexity trade-off of the SISO symbol detector. Towards this end, an improved path metric is proposed, which accounts for the information on undecided symbols at a particular path visited. The inclusion of this information is enabled through a bias term which is added to the conventional path metric in order to reflect the contributions of the undecided symbols. We derive the bias term using soft unconstrained linear estimates of undecided symbols. As a result, the ISS-MA that picks up the best M candidates based on this modified path metric exhibits improved performance/complexity trade-off compared to the existing SISO detectors.

Two different instance-based pitch classification methods are proposed, the choice of which depends on the size of the available training database. In the first method, the conventional K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is trained on a large database of piano tones and employed for monophonic pitch detection. For cases where the training database contains only one sample from each possible note, a two-step algorithm, combining semi-KNN pitch candidate selection and note sequence tracking, is suggested.

Robust target tracking with multi-static sensors under insufficient TDOA information,"Hyunhak Shin, Bonhwa Ku, Jill K Nelson, Hanseok Ko",2018/5/8,Journal Sensors,"This paper focuses on underwater target tracking based on a multi-static sonar network composed of passive sonobuoys and an active ping. In the multi-static sonar network, the location of the target can be estimated using TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) measurements. However, since the sensor network may obtain insufficient and inaccurate TDOA measurements due to ambient noise and other harsh underwater conditions, target tracking performance can be significantly degraded. We propose a robust target tracking algorithm designed to operate in such a scenario. First, track management with track splitting is applied to reduce performance degradation caused by insufficient measurements. Second, a target location is estimated by a fusion of multiple TDOA measurements using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In addition, the target trajectory is refined by conducting a stack-based data association method based on multiple-frames measurements in order to more accurately estimate target trajectory. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations.",6
Interdisciplinary design: The saga continues,"Brent Nuttall, Jill Nelson, Allen Estes",2011,Journal 2011 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition Proceedings,"The College of Architecture and Environmental Design at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo is the only college in the nation that has departments of Architecture, Architectural Engineering and Construction Management in the same college.

To enhance this collaboration, the college committed to providing an upper division interdisciplinary experience to every student in the form of a project based, team oriented five unit studio that every student would take. This new course, launched in 2009, requires small teams of architecture, architectural engineering and construction students to complete the schematic level design of an actual building for a real client. While developing a college wide interdisciplinary course sounded simple in theory, it has proved to be much more challenging in practice.

This paper reports on the progress of this course using survey assessment data and direct performance indicators. This same data provides valuable support to the 3 ak ABET program criteria. Finally, the future of the course and the suggested improvements are highlighted.",6
Target tracking via a sampling stack-based approach,"Hossein Roufarshbaf, Jill K Nelson",2009/11/1,"Conference 2009 Conference Record of the Forty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","We propose a novel approach to tracking a target in clutter based on the stack algorithm for tree search. The proposed tracking approach reduces the size of the search tree by employing a coarse discretization of the target state space. To reduce the quantization error that results from coarse discretization, the representative value of each quantized region is sampled from an estimated importance sampling function. A forgetting factor is included in the likelihood metric to control the effect of previous decisions and to reduce algorithm complexity. Simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm provides significantly reduced complexity while suffering no performance degradation relative to stack-based tracking with finer quantization.",6
Mitigating the effects of intersymbol interference: Algorithms and analysis,Jill Karen Nelson,2005,Institution University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,"A major source of signal distortion in frequency-selective channels is inter-symbol interference (ISI). Because ISI channels are prevalent in communications systems, much effort has been devoted to developing effective equalizers for such channels. In this dissertation, we propose a framework for studying the performance of equalizers for ISI channels in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Asymptotic efficiency is well known in multiuser detection as a method for quantifying the performance of a particular receiver relative to the best achievable performance in the absence of multiuser interference. We extend the concept of asymptotic efficiency to the study of equalizers for ISI channels. Using asymptotic efficiency, we characterize the performance of various equalizers as the channel noise variance approaches zero.",6
Discipline-based teaching development groups: The SIMPLE framework for change from within,"Jill K Nelson, Margret A Hjalmarson",2020/12/15,Journal Transforming institutions: Accelerating systemic change in higher education,"While a significant body of research provides evidence that interactive, student-centered teaching improves learning, engagement, and retention, adoption of these teaching practices in STEM disciplines has been slow (National Research Council, 2012). This paper studies the value of an ongoing faculty development model to support instructors as they change their teaching to adopt research-supported, student-centered teaching practices. The teaching development model is structured around discipline-based faculty learning communities (SIMPLE groups) that meet regularly for at least one academic year. SIMPLE groups operate according to five principles put forth by the SIMPLE model for faculty teaching development: Sustained, Incremental change, Mentoring, People driven, and Learning-Environment focused. The focus of the project on which we report was to scale the SIMPLE model to multiple STEM departments at a single institution and to study how the principles of the model were enacted across the different teaching development groups. In this paper, we consider the following research question: How does the nature of SIMPLE groups support the adoption of reflective teaching practices? Through examining this research question, we aim to understand how ongoing teaching development groups can contribute to department-focused change toward evidence-based teaching practices.",5

A Bayesian tree-search track initiation algorithm for dim targets,"Hossein Roufarshbaf, Jill K Nelson",2013/3/20,Conference 2013 47th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS),"A novel algorithm for multi-target track initiation in dense clutter environments is proposed based on approximating local maxima in the observation likelihood function. The algorithm implements a tree structure to search for local maxima of the observation likelihood function by dividing the entire surveillance area into large subsets and narrowing the search inside each subset in which there is a high likelihood that a target is present. A rough Gaussian approximation technique is proposed to reduce complexity in calculating the observation likelihood function over a subset by avoiding integration. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a multi-target benchmark dataset and shows superior performance in terms of high target detection probability, low probability of false alarm, and low computational complexity.",5

BAD: Bidirectional arbitrated decision feedback equalization,"AC Singer, U Madhow, CS McGahey, JK Nelson",2001,Journal submitted for publication,"A new equalization method is presented whose performance lies between those of the classical decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and optimum maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) equalization. Unlike the exponential (in channel length) complexity per demodulated symbol of ML and MAP equalization, the new method, termed the bidirectional arbitrated DFE (BAD), has complexity linear in the channel length, which is of the same order as the complexity of a DFE. The key features of the method, which builds on the classical DFE, are as follows:(a) Bidirectional block processing: Two different estimates of the data sequence are obtained by running a forward and a reverse DFE in parallel on a block of received data.(b) Arbitration: For each symbol decision, a new decision is made by arbitrating among the estimated symbol sequences from the two DFEs by deciding which sequence explains the received data best locally around the symbol of interest. This can be viewed as a local MAP decision, but with only two candidate data sequences.",5
Applying conjecture mapping as a design-based research method to examine the design and implementation of a teaching development project for STEM faculty,"Lori C Bland, MA Hjalmarson, Jill K Nelson, AS Samaras",2017/6,Journal ASEE Annual Conference proceedings,"Changing teaching strategies in engineering education to become more interactive is important, though difficult. Intentional design of faculty development to engage faculty to make small, incremental changes within the context of a supportive, like-minded community, is important. In this paper, we merged two different methods to examine the PIs design decisions, and evaluate the program’s implementation and outcomes. For the first method, the grant evaluator applied conjecture mapping, 1 a design-based research method, to examine the design and theoretical conjectures, the mediating processes, and outcomes of implementation of a faculty development project. The high level conjecture was that faculty who participate in a supportive teaching network will make initial small changes in their teaching, which will lead to increasingly larger changes over time. For the second method, the principal investigators (PIs) applied self-study, 2 a qualitative research method, to examine and reflect on their design-based decisions, implementation, and outcomes. Results indicated that the structures and practices supported mediating processes. Mediating processes became proximal outcomes. Medial and distal outcomes for faculty change may likely be a multi-year trajectory. Conjecture mapping and selfstudy proved to be useful methods in evaluating a process grant focusing on faculty change.",4
Designing active learning environments,"John R Buck, KE Wage, JK Nelson",2016,Journal Acoustics Today,"Blending active learning with some lecture and external resources such as textbooks and videos creates the conditions needed for a student-centered learning environment. In a musical analogy, the professor in a student-centered course becomes the DJ, mixing together multiple modes of instruction for the students’ benefit (Figure 1). In contrast, the professor in a traditional lecture course is the soloist or pop star, delivering content with minimal feedback from students. Although many faculty worry that changing from lecture to student-centered learning means that they will not have time to cover as much material, the data indicate that students master more material despite the professor covering less. Switching from lecture to active learning is an act of courage, but the growing consensus of research on the benefits of active learning is difficult to ignore.",4

She selected this metaphor for teaching to provoke a discussion in the spaceof instructional technology, but it is appropriate to a discussion of teaching even withouttechnology. Expanding on this sense of teaching as a design process, we can consider design-based research as a framework for organizing research studies in engineering. There have beenrelatively few studies in engineering education that characterize themselves as design researchstudies, but it is an expanding framework within the education research community (Anderson &Shattuck, 2012; Kelly, 2014). This paper uses one small-scale design-based research study offaculty development to explain the principles and practices that can make up a design-basedresearch study of teaching and learning. Design plays a role at two levels in the process. At thefirst level, instructors are designing and implementing new teaching strategies. At the secondlevel, the researchers are designing a model for teaching development for faculty. In addition, weexplain how teaching as a design process comes to be important when considering teachingdevelopment initiatives for faculty.

Feature-aided initiation and tracking via tree search,"Hossein Roufarshbaf, Jill K Nelson",2013/11/3,"Conference 2013 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","We present a feature-aided approach to multiple-target tracking built upon tree-search tracking algorithms. Using a search tree to represent the target state space, the tracker navigates the tree to identify the most likely sequence of states visited by the target(s). The search for new targets and for new states of existing targets is governed by path metrics that are proportional to the posterior state distribution and incorporate the likelihood of observed feature values. Features may be assumed to follow a given statistical model, or their probability density functions may be estimated empirically using feature history stored with each track in the tree. The performance of the proposed feature-aided tracker is evaluated on the CLUTTER09 dataset. Improvement with respect to target detection/tracking and clutter rejection is evaluated relative to tracking in the absence of feature information.",4
A geometric approach to improve interference mitigation in multi-user detection and equalization,"Ananya Sen Gupta, Jill K Nelson, Weiwei Zhou, Andrew C Singer, James Preisig",2010/11/22,Journal IEEE transactions on signal processing,"We apply maximal asymptotic conditional efficiency joint successive interference cancellation (MACE-JSIC) to frequency-selective channel equalization and propose improvements that extend MACE-JSIC detection to the broader paradigm of time-varying and imprecisely known communication systems. The need for expensive redesign to include any change in the interfering signals is a fundamental limitation of MACE-JSIC detection despite its high performance and low detection complexity. In this work, we derive sufficiency criteria that reduce maximum asymptotic efficiency (MAE) detection to low-complexity decorrelation and exploit this relationship to extend the MACE-JSIC approach to time-varying communication systems. Simulations on several multi-user systems and frequency-selective channels demonstrate that the performance of the proposed detectors is consistent with theoretical expectations.",4

We employ asymptotic efficiency analysis to characterize the performance of the detector as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approaches infinity. Asymptotic efficiency analysis allows us to quantify the loss in performance due to the presence of intersymbol interference (ISI) and the lack of channel knowledge. We show that, under certain conditions, the asymptotic efficiency of the detector depends only on a single most-likely noise realization. Our results indicate that the performance of the RLS-based detector is strongly dependent on both the magnitude of the ISI and the number of data samples available.",4

Using asymptotic efficiency analysis, we characterize the performance of BAD as the channel noise variance approaches zero. We consider the case in which the channel is perfectly known to the receiver, as well as the case in which the channel estimate is in error. Asymptotic efficiency analysis allows us to quantify the loss in performance due both to inter-symbol interference (ISI) and imperfect channel estimation. The asymptotic efficiency of BAD is compared to that of a matched filter receiver, a maximum likelihood sequence estimator, and a standard DFE.

Being place bound becomes an issue of inclusion and access when place bound students live in an engineering education desert, or a geographic region where there is no access to face-to-face engineering education programs. Our data show that 1 in 3 Americans live in an engineering education desert. The geographic spread of two-year colleges throughout the United States makes them a vital link in connecting place bound students with opportunities for 2-and 4-year degrees in engineering and engineering technology. This paper first follows Hillerman’s work by applying statistically created Commuting Zones to determine the availability of both lower division and upper division face-to-face degrees in engineering and engineering technology. That data is then crossed with the results of a study of average distance from their permanent address that students travel to college based on the type of institution. When stratified by institution type, this data visually and statistically demonstrates the vital role of two-year colleges in providing engineering education access for all Americans. Finally, we apply an inclusion lens to consider the implications of our data and interventions that support recruiting and retaining place bound students. These interventions are both local to a particular college such as curricular elements and student affairs strategies, and broader across the network of two-year colleges, four-year colleges and industry, such as articulation agreements and partnerships in all directions.

Simulation results show that the algorithm can successfully classify the observed modulation schemes with as few as 50 symbol observations, making the algorithm practical under time-varying conditions, as well.

The aim of this NSF-funded project was to study the use of ongoing teaching development groups as a mechanism for broadening the adoption of student-centered teaching strategies in university STEM courses. Discipline-focused teaching development groups operated in six different STEM departments within a single university. Groups met regularly over the course of at least one academic year. During group meetings, participants learned about evidence-based teaching strategies, shared their own challenges and ideas for their classrooms, and received feedback on strategies they were developing and/or implementing. The ongoing teaching development group model implemented in this project was motivated by existing work in K-12 professional development that shows the value of continuing, collaborative teaching development that connects to instructors' classroom experiences.

Its design complexity is exponential in the length of channel and equalizer, making it impractical for long channels. The proposed method exploits the relationship between the channel vectors and the convex hull formed by the noise-free channel outputs to design the MAE equalizer directly from the channel coefficients without requiring a search of the convex hull.

Adaptive maximal asymptotic efficiency equalization using constellation mapping,"Weiwei Zhou, Jill K Nelson, Ananya Sen Gupta",2011/1/4,Conference 2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE),"The focus of this paper is the extension of maximum asymptotic efficiency (MAE) equalization for application to time-varying communication channels. While the asymptotically optimal MAE equalizer is very attractive in its low runtime complexity, it suffers from high (exponential in channel and equalizer length) design complexity. Frequent redesign renders the effective operational complexity of the MAE equalizer impractical for implementation in time-varying channels. In this work, we address this issue by mapping the time-varying channel to a fixed channel for which the MAE equalizer is pre-designed. The channel mapping is performed via a linear pre-filter. Simulation results reveal that a pre-filter followed by a fixed MAE equalizer achieves gains of up to 4 dB over a conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear equalizer in the high SNR regime. The proposed adaptive equalizer provides a balance …",2
Students’ Understanding Of Sequence And Series As Applied In Electrical Engineering,"Jill Nelson, Margret Hjalmarson",2009/6/14,Conference 2009 Annual Conference & Exposition,"Across all engineering fields, upper-level engineering courses often build upon a strong mathematical foundation. As such, a critical component of understanding how students learn engineering concepts is studying how students apply their mathematical background to the engineering domain. Studying how students apply mathematical knowledge in engineering courses allows us to identify challenges, pitfalls, and common misconceptions. Through an NSF-funded study, we are addressing the broad goal of developing a better understanding of how students transfer mathematical knowledge to concepts in engineering. In this component of the study, we focus on electrical engineering students’ application of concepts in sequence and series to a junior-level signals and systems course. A strong understanding of sequence and series is fundamental to the study of discrete-time signals and systems. A discrete-time system response takes the form of a sequence, and the characteristics of this sequence and of the associated series dictate system properties such as causality, stability, memory, and finite vs. infinite impulse response. Additionally, sequence and series are the basis of discrete-time Fourier series and transforms, which provide the primary tool for frequency-domain signals and systems analysis. We have selected and analyzed five group problems based on their connection to significant concepts in sequence and series. The results of our analysis indicate that students encounter challenges in associating mathematical expressions with physical realities, providing logical justifications for their conclusions, and manipulating multiple …",2
Detection capabilities of randomly-deployed underwater sensors,"Jill K Nelson, Errol G Rowe, G Clifford Carter",2008/3/31,"Conference 2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","A problem of interest in ocean engineering is the defense of a particular region of the ocean, often referred to as a sea base. Among the primary challenges in defending the sea base is effective and efficient detection of intruders that travel through the space. A recent focus on undersea distributed networked systems (UDNS) has raised the question of how effectively small, randomly distributed sensors can detect such intruders relative to larger sensing platforms. We develop an analytical framework for characterizing the detection performance of a set of sensors deployed within a sea base. Focusing on the detection of a target traveling a straight line, we employ our framework to compare the performance of various sensing approaches as a function of the number of sensors, sensing radius, sensor location, and sensor cost.

Where’s My Whiteboard? The Challenge of Moving Active-learning Mathematics Classes Online,"Jill K Nelson, Jessica Rosenberg, Kathryn Fernandez, Julie Shank",2021/7,Journal 2021 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference,"This research paper studies the challenges that mathematics faculty and graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) faced when moving active and collaborative calculus courses from in-person to virtual instruction. As part of a larger pedagogical change project (described below), the math department at a public Research-1 university began transitioning pre-calculus and calculus courses to an active and collaborative learning (ACL) format in Fall 2019. The change began with the introduction of collaborative worksheets in recitations which were led by GTAs and supported by undergraduate learning assistants (LAs). Students recitation periods collaboratively solving the worksheet problems on whiteboards. When COVID-19 forced the rapid transition to online teaching, these ACL efforts faced an array of challenges. Faculty and GTA reflections on the changes to teaching and learning provide insight into how instructional staff can be supported in implementing ACL across various modes of instruction. The calculus teaching change efforts discussed in this paper are part of an NSF-supported project that aims to make ACL the default method of instruction in highly enrolled gateway STEM courses across the institution. The theoretical framework for the project builds on existing work on grassroots change in higher education (Kezar and Lester, 2011) to study the effect of communities of practice on changing teaching culture. The project uses course-based communities of practice (Wenger, 1999) that include instructors, GTAs, and LAs working together to design and enact teaching change in the targeted courses alongside ongoing professional …",1
Using predicted target state to inform transmit waveform selection in active sonar,"Venakata Veeramachaneni, Jill K Nelson",2020/10,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America," <?A3B2 twb .21w?>Continuous-wave (CW) and frequency-modulated (FM) transmit pulses are commonly used in active sonar systems. CW pulses allow for measurement of target Doppler but have relatively poor range accuracy. In contrast, FM pulses are insensitive to Doppler but allow for improved range accuracy relative to CW. Active sonars often operate in clutter-dominated environments, where choosing a CW pulse for a high Doppler target provides better tracking capability, while an FM pulse is more effective for a low Doppler target. A challenge, however, is that the target Doppler not known before transmission. At present, the complementary strengths of CW and FM pulses can be exploited only by an operator who actively chooses between them, but requiring an operator to select the transmitted waveform on a ping-by-ping basis presents an unreasonable burden.

Blind sequential detection for sparse ISI channels,"Weiwei Zhou, Jill K Nelson",2018/12,Journal EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing,"We present a computationally efficient blind sequential detection method for data transmitted over a sparse intersymbol interference channel. Unlike blind sequential detection methods designed for general channels, the proposed method exploits the channel sparsity by using estimated channel sparsity to assist in the detection of the transmitted sequence. A Gaussian mixture model is used to describe sparse channels, and two tree-search strategies are applied to estimate the channel sparsity and the transmitted sequence, respectively. To demonstrate the performance improvement achieved by the proposed blind detector, we compare it to conventional joint channel and sequence detection methods that use sparse channel estimation techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed detector not only reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods but also provides superior performance, particularly when the signal to noise ratio is low.",1

In the majority of cases, these efforts are focused on particularinterventions, eg encouraging instructors to incorporate in-class group problem solvingor to use a particular technology tool. While the particular intervention may prove usefulfor some instructors and some courses, it is not chosen with the needs or challenges of theinstructor in mind. We argue that efforts to broaden use of innovative instructionaltechniques can be more successful when faculty are given ownership of how change isimplemented in their classes. We examine how Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovationsframework (2003) can be used to structure teaching development groups that focus onfaculty autonomy in decision-making about their teaching. Rogers states that five factors influence the adoption of an innovation. Among thesefactors is the relative advantage of the innovation, ie, the improvement over what iscurrently in use. When instructors use challenges in their classroom as motivation toinnovate, opportunity for improvement is clear to them. A second factor is compatibilityof the innovation, or its ease of integration. When instructors identify their own problems, they select or adapt interventions that fit well within their course and minimize additionaloverhead. A third element in Rogers’ framework is trialability, or the user’s ability toapply the innovation in their own setting, a factor clearly supported by instructor-selectedmotivations.

The goal of the large geographic scale experiment was to better understand the ionosphere changes during a rapid shift from light to dark. Citizen science projects that ask participants to build their own data collection instruments are uncommon due to debugging and data collection ch allenges. EclipseMob 1.0 p articipants were able to build working receiver s, but due to a technical issue with the receiver design, the data they collected was not usable. Asking participants to build-their own instrument as part of the project resulted in several key challenges for future experiment iterations: access to local just-in-time technical build/test support; need for a low tech, user-friendly way to test the …",

Knowledge representation in goal-motivated decision making for intelligent active sonar,Jill K Nelson,2020/10,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"We consider knowledge representation in a goal-driven model for intelligent, or cognitive, active sonar designed to improve system performance and reduce sonar operator burden. The intelligent sonar uses observations of the environment (broadly defined) and predictions of future behavior to make decisions that leverage system resources to address a set of goals. These goals are created and managed by the system itself with possible input from the sonar operator. Decisions take the form of action selections, where actions may include transmit waveform, ping interval, illuminated region, etc. Each action is assigned a utility score, or metric, based on how well it addresses each system goal, with weighting according to how simultaneous (possibly competing) goals are prioritized by the system and/or operator. Metrics for evaluating candidate actions rely on signal processing models for localization and tracking in …",

We will also solicit discussion from the audience members, who will be asked to identify their most pressing needs for supporting graduate students.",
ON DEMAND: Teaching Professional Development for STEM GTAs (15 mins),"Jill Nelson, Jessica Rosenberg, Mary Nelson, Robert Sachs, Liz White, Mark Snyder, Margret Hjalmarson",2020/7/31,Journal Innovations in Teaching & Learning Conference Proceedings,"GTAs have significant teaching and learning responsibilities in many highly enrolled undergraduate STEM courses at Mason. They serve as recitation instructors, laboratory instructors, tutors (via office hours), and graders. In these roles, GTAs can have a significant impact on undergraduate students’ learning experience. Hence, mentoring GTAs as they develop and refine their teaching skills is critical to the success of our undergraduate STEM programs. That said, traditionally there has been little investment in formal GTA training beyond the department level at Mason. A variety of models for STEM GTA training have been described in existing literature. Proposed models often take the form of intensive summer institutes (eg, Rivera, 2018; Dragisich, 2016) that are one to two weeks in length.

Managing dual academic careers,"Yuting W Chen, Jena Shafai Asgarpoor, Robyn Sandekian, Jill K Nelson, Lee Kemp Rynearson, Shannon Bartelt-Hunt, Janet Callahan",2020/6/22,Conference 2020 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access,"As more and more partners desire to take up academic positions, managing dual careers is a matter that has profound impact both professionally and personally. Despite the rapid growth in engineering programs across the country, securing even just one faculty position is not an easy feat. When it is a dual-career opportunity, ideally this means securing two positions in the same university, which brings its own level of difficulty and complication. Often, universities work to make dual offers, which once accepted, is the beginning of realizing ongoing challenges associated with being a dual-career couple. This is especially true when raising a family. With competing travel schedules, teaching schedules, deadlines and meetings, making compromises can be a frequent occurrence. It’s not uncommon to have a crisis where a child needs to stay home and neither one of the parents is available. This panel brings together people from multiple levels of the university, from administrative through faculty who will bring their insights to bear. Panelists will offer tips and perspectives on managing dual academic careers, including navigating the academic job market as a dual career couple, achieving work-life balance, and best practices for supporting dual career faculty as a unit/college administrator. With panelists from four different universities, all in different stages in their careers, an engaged audience that includes instructional faculty at all levels, academic leaders and those considering an academic career will learn from this panel.",
The Benefits of Discipline-based Communities for Faculty Teaching Development,"Margret Hjalmarson, Jill K Nelson",2020/6/22,Conference 2020 ASEE Virtual Annual Conference Content Access,"This lessons learned paper focuses on a set of faculty development groups that were active in STEM departments over a multi-year period. These group operated based on the SIMPLE Design model for faculty teaching development, which provides a structure in which instructors meet on a regular (anywhere from weekly to monthly) basis to learn about research-supported teaching strategies and receive support and feedback as they try those strategies in their classes. A central element of these SIMPLE teaching development groups is that they are discipline based; groups are centered within a single department or anchored by a shared program or curriculum. This characteristic of the model was motivated in part by the fact that STEM instructors often find it challenging to translate general teaching advice and strategies to discipline-specific contexts. We hypothesized that grouping instructors by discipline would facilitate “translation.”",

Broadly, these teaching strategies may be characterized as active, inquiry-based, student/learner-centered The SIMPLE model emphasizes a people-driven approach; participants in SIMPLE groups bring their own teaching challenges to the group and identify potential ways to address those challenges from a menu of options introduced and discussed by the group.",
Evaluation of Yeast Fermentate Supplementation on Poultry Stress Susceptibility and Physiology,Jill Nelson,2020/6/9,"Description Reducing stress is an important goal in poultry production. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae-derived yeast fermentation product Original XPC (XPC, Diamond V Mills, Cedar Rapids, IA, United States) has been shown to reduce the severity of enteric infection and reduce measures of stress in poultry exposed to acute or chronic stress. However, the effect of dietary supplementation of yeast fermentate on other physiological parameters and its mode of action in reducing stress remains unclear. This work aimed to investigate the effects of supplementing XPC or its liquid equivalent, AviCare (Diamond V Mills), on measures of stress susceptibility, health and well-being in poultry exposed to acute and chronic stressors. Three consecutive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of yeast fermentate supplementation on measures of stress, growth and feed efficiency in Cobb 500 male broilers exposed to acute and rearing stressors. Both XPC and AviCare consistently and equally reduced measures of short- and long-term stress across all 3 experiments, although trends in body weight gain and feed efficiency were inconsistent. A fourth experiment investigated the effects of XPC and AviCare on measures of stress, plasma biochemistry, cecal microbiome and expression of stress- and immune-related genes in Cobb 500 male broilers. Both XPC and AviCare reduced stress by reducing expression of the ACTH receptor, and modulated immune activity by reducing IL10 and CYP1A2 gene expression as well as plasma IL-1β.

Experiences of Faculty in an Ongoing Teaching Development Group: Identifying Characteristics that Support Sustainability,"Jill K Nelson, Margret A Hjalmarson",2019,"Description To increase the likelihood of successful and sustained adoption of student-centered teaching practices, it is important to provide teaching development support to instructors as they move toward a student-centered model. This paper considers data collected during an NSF-supported faculty development effort in which ongoing discipline-based teaching development groups (TDGs) were formed in several STEM departments at a single university. Groups met on a regular basis over at least one academic year and provided a way for participants to learn about research-supported teaching strategies, share experiences in implementing these strategies, and find support as they faced challenges along the way. Of particular interest is studying how these TDGs evolved over time and whether certain factors contributed to (or hindered) sustainability. In this paper, we focus on the activities of a single TDG that remained active for more than two years. Interviews with the TDG leader and participants on an annual basis provide the data for this paper. Through descriptive coding of the data, we identify several characteristics of the TDG’s structure and function that may have supported the group’s sustained activity.","To increase the likelihood of successful and sustained adoption of student-centered teaching practices, it is important to provide teaching development support to instructors as they move toward a student-centered model.

Achievement goals play an important role in student learning, as they affect multiple learning outcomes, including achievement, effort, and persistence. These effects, however, tend to differ depending on how goals are conceptualized and in which context they are applied. In this study, we used a person-centered approach to analyze how students can be categorized in terms of their goals in the context of an Introduction to Signals and Systems course. To conceptualize student goals, we expanded existing frameworks to include approach/avoidance, mastery/performance, and task/self/other dimensions. Through cluster analysis, we identified two types of students: (1) students all of whose goals are strong and (2) students whose task- and self-related, but not other-related, goals are strong.

Inter-Class Collaboration Project to Enhance Learning in Computer Science,"Maria Pantoja, Zoe Wood",2018/3/25,Conference 2018 ASEE Zone IV Conference,"Engineers in general and computer scientists in particular are required to work in collaborative, interdisciplinary environments. Communication skills and the ability to work in groups within different departments inside a company are often required for jobs in the industry. To expose students to this collaborative experience most engineering programs require a senior design project in the last year of courses, however, these capstone type projects risk creating a feeling of disconnect as opposed to an integrated experience with the prior curriculum. To further improve our students’ collaboration skills and expose students to the pedagogical benefits of collaborative learning, we designed and implemented a collaboration between two different computer science classes (CS). Our collaborative inter-class project has the immediate intention of mutual learning across related but distinct topics, but also to increase student retention of knowledge by providing them with a similar experience to what they will encounter in industry. These kinds of hands-on applied team work exercises have been shown to have benefits for all students and for female students in particular. Our collaboration involves two distinct but related courses in Computer Science, Parallel Programming (PP) and Computer Graphics (CG). While both class contents are essentially different, in reality most computer graphics problems are executed on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) which are heavily studied and used in PP; and many of the very interesting problems in PP are CG related.

Profiles of Participation Outcomes in Faculty Learning Communities,"Margret Hjalmarson, Daria Gerasimova, Jill K Nelson",2017/6/24,Conference 2017 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"Research suggests that changing undergraduate teaching often requires promoting instructors’ knowledge and use of interactive teaching strategies and providing instructors with support for their teaching (Felder & Brent, 2010; McCrickerd, 2012). Faculty learning communities are one means of supporting teaching development (eg, Anderson & Finelli, 2014; Sirum & Madigan, 2010; Zemke & Zemke, 2014). In our multi-year project, we organized discipline-specific learning communities in STEM departments. Four FLCs were launched in Year 1 with three continuing in year 2; four additional FLCs were launched in Year 2. These teaching development groups (TDGs) included from three to ten instructors. Each TDG was led by a faculty member from the department. Groups met throughout an academic year to discuss topics of interest, share experience, learn more about teaching and support each other in teaching. The study asked: what are profiles of participation in TDGs? To answer this question, we used a qualitative methodology. The collected data included semi-structured interviews from group leaders and members. Analysis was conducted through coding the transcribed interviews in Dedoose. The codes were synthesized into two participation profiles: Implementation Profile and Peer Support Profile. For members within the first profile, Implementation, they reported that during the meetings they learned about new strategies or other aspects of teaching. Some members found some of these strategies or aspects useful for their classes and wanted to implement them. While some participants stopped at the point of just considering …",
Exploring Experiences of Graduate Teaching Assistants in Teaching Professional Development Groups,"Jill K Nelson, D Gerasimova, MA Hjalmarson, JR Schwebach",2017/6,Journal ASEE Annual Conference proceedings,"Evidence-based teaching practices (EBTP)—like inquiry-based learning, inclusive teaching, and active learning—have been shown to benefit all students, especially women, first-generation, and traditionally minoritized students in science fields. However, little research has focused on how best to train teaching assistants (TAs) to use EBTP or on which components of professional development are most important. We designed and experimentally manipulated a series of pre-semester workshops on active learning (AL), dividing subjects into two groups. The Activity group worked in teams to learn an AL technique with a workshop facilitator. These teams then modeled the activity with their peers acting as students. In the Evidence group, facilitators modeled the activities with all TAs acting as students. We used a mixed-methods research design (specifically, concurrent triangulation) to interpret pre-and post-workshop and post-semester survey responses. We found that Evidence group participants reported greater knowledge of AL after the workshop than Activity group participants. Activity group participants, on the other hand, found all of the AL techniques more useful than Evidence group participants. These results suggest that actually modeling AL techniques made them more useful to TAs than simply experiencing the same techniques as students—even with the accompanying evidence. This outcome has broad implications more»",
VLF/LF and the 2017 Total Solar Eclipse,"W Liles, L Lukes, J Nelson, K Kerby-Patel",2017/1,Journal Society of Amateur Radio Astronomers Annual Meeting,"The very first use of the solar eclipse to study the ionosphere was done in 1912 at a wavelength of 5,500 meters. Since that time, multiple studies have been done at VLF and LF frequencies. Most of these studies were performed at a single receive site with a single transmit location during a single eclipse, thus making it very hard to compare data from separate collections. This paper addresses historical collection efforts, what has been learned about the sun’s influence upon the ionosphere, and the role of neutral corpuscular particles ionizing the ionosphere. Questions raised by the above will be addressed. A planned crowdsource effort will then be described that will attempt to address and answer questions raised by having multiple receivers all reporting on signals transmitted by the same VLF/LF stations. There are two approaches to the crowdsource collection. One approach uses the SuperSID network that is already reporting on changes in propagation of signals from VLF stations. The other approach uses a receiver and antenna based upon an instrumentation amplifier chip and a smart phone as a software defined radio. The later approach will be detailed.",
Lateral Strength and Ductile Behavior of a Mortise-Tenon Connected Timber Frame,Alexandros Kouromenos,2017,"Description The primary goals of this project were to examine the amount of lateral force resisted by a single-bay mortise-tenon connected timber moment frame, and to introduce ductile behavior into the mortise-tenon connections by adding a steel sleeve around a traditional wood peg. This research aimed to provide proof that traditional timber frames are capable of ductile racking while reliably complying with ASCE 7-10 building code drift speci! cations, implying an increase in the ASCE 7-10 ductility factor (R) for wood frames when used as lateral force resisting elements. A secondary goal was to promote traditional heavy timber framing as a main structural system. Modern structural framing is dominated by light-wood, steel, and concrete framing. The exploration in this project aspires to demonstrate that heavy timber frames can achieve comparable lateral performance and frame behavior to other current lateral systems, reassuring the reliability of traditional timber frames.","The primary goals of this project were to examine the amount of lateral force resisted by a single-bay mortise-tenon connected timber moment frame, and to introduce ductile behavior into the mortise-tenon connections by adding a steel sleeve around a traditional wood peg.

On the use of solar eclipses to study the ionosphere,"W Liles, C Mitchell, M Cohen, G Earle, N Frissell, K Kirby-Patel, L Lukes, E Miller, M Moses, J Nelson, J Rockway",2017/1,Journal 15th International Ionospheric Effects Symposium,"Exploring the effects of solar eclipses on radio wave propagation has been an active area of research since the first experiments conducted in 1912. In the first few decades of ionospheric physics, researchers started to explore the natural laboratory of the upper atmosphere. Solar eclipses offered a rare opportunity to undertake an active experiment. The results stimulated much scientific discussion. Early users of radio noticed that propagation was different during night and day. A solar eclipse provided the opportunity to study this day/night effect with much sharper boundaries than at sunrise and sunset, when gradual changes occur along with temperature changes in the atmosphere and variations in the sun angle. Plots of amplitude time series were hypothesized to indicate the recombination rates and reionization rates of the ionosphere during and after the eclipse, though not all time-amplitude plots showed the same curve shapes. A few studies used multiple receivers paired with one transmitter for one eclipse, with a 5:1 ratio as the upper bound. In these cases, the signal amplitude plots generated for data received from the five receive sites for one transmitter varied greatly in shape. Examination of very earliest results shows the difficulty in using a solar eclipse to study propagation; different researchers used different frequencies from different locations at different times. Solar eclipses have been used to study propagation at a range of radio frequencies. For example, the first study in 1912 used a receiver tuned to 5,500 meters, roughly 54.545 kHz. We now have data from solar eclipses at frequencies ranging from VLF through HF, from many …",

As part of this project, participants have been trying new interactive teaching strategies in their classrooms and documenting the process in the form of a design memo. A design memo is a short, structured reflection on the implementation of a particular teaching strategy. In the context of the SIMPLE Project, design memos pursue two goals: prompting instructors to engage in reflection about their teaching, and serving as sharable artifacts for other instructors interested in adopting similar strategies.",
Teaching Strategies for Nourishing Creativity and Innovation,"Mihai Boicu, Ioulia Rytikova, Laura Poms, Jill Nelson, Nathalia Peixoto, Lance Sherry, Gheorghe Tecuci",2016/7/15,Journal Innovations in Teaching & Learning Conference Proceedings,"Creativity and innovation is at the core of the PhD programs, but it is much less present in undergraduate or master programs creating a difficult gap for many students. Moreover, the dynamics of the evolution of the current world is making creativity and innovation a requirement for many jobs. However, large class sizes, density of the material presented, domain complexity and instructor research experience are some of the limiting factors that make difficult to include creativity and innovation training in the undergraduate curriculum. In this lightning talk session, educators with practical experience in preparing undergraduate students for creativity, innovation and research, will present and debate strategies to overcome these challenges in classes of various types (eg online vs. in class), levels (introductory vs. specialized electives) and using a diverse spectrum of methods,(including active learning, experiential …",

Maximum asymptotic efficiency equalizer with decision feedback,"Weiwei Zhou, Jill K Nelson",2014/12/8,Conference 2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference,"This work extends the maximum asymptotic efficiency (MAE) equalizer to include decision feedback (MAE-DFE). A geometrically-inspired approach is used to design the MAE-DFE and analyze its equalization performance. It is shown that with decision feedback, the MAE-DFE not only provides better performance than the original MAE equalizer, but also significantly reduces the computational complexity. We investigate the effect of feedforward filter length, feedback filter length, and decision delay on the performance of the MAE-DFE. In the design of the MAE-DFE, practical rules to determine the three parameters are derived to optimize its performance, and numerical results are shown to demonstrate their effect. The effect of error propagation on the MAE-DFE is also shown in simulations.",

Training Apples to Perform Like Oranges: A Look at University Teaming Education,"Jill Nelson, Andrew J Holtz",2012/6/10,Conference 2012 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"Training Apples to Perform Like Oranges: A Look at University Teaming EducationTo effectively function in the workplace today, people must be proficient in their technical skillsand must also be able to function as an effective team member. In the workplace they must workwell with people of different disciplines and motivations. Universities have recognized this needand have adapted their curriculum to place additional emphasis on teaching the skills necessaryto be an effective team member. Yet universities, constrained by their organizational structureand missions, cannot completely mimic the realities of the workplace business environment. Classes have a finite length and students quickly learn that any problem can be endured throughthe academic quarter instead of truly working out a sustainable solution. Teams composed ofmembers with similar expertise are often willing to cover for the weaker team member due to theshort team life which is usually measured in weeks. In teams with mixed expertise, grades areoften given based on a combination of individual/team effort versus solely on the team product. Faculty continually grapples with questions such as “can a team member be fired” and “if not, what are the realistic consequences?” School is a learning environment where student learning isfostered and students are given second chances. Academic culture, by its very nature, is opposedto unfairness, dire consequences, swift punishment and the harsh reality encountered in the worldand specifically, the workplace. Considering these types of issues leads one to wonder how wellthe university education prepares a student to be …",

Preliminary Analysis of the Effectiveness of Correlating with Band-limited Coded Sequences for Improving the Resolvability of Closely Spaced Echoes in an Air-coupled Ultrasonic …,"Mark Chaney, Kris Gaj, Jens-Peter Kaps, Jill Nelson",2012,Institution George Mason University,"Ultrasonic ranging systems that are vulnerable to crosstalk often use coded sequences to reduce the effects of crosstalk. Correlation of the received waveform with each of the known code sequences disambiguates the source of the transmission. As the transmitted waves reflect off of the surrounding surfaces, a multitude of phases are received which appear as multiple peaks in the correlation surface. When the phases are too closely spaced, the peaks may blend together and appear to be a single peak to the detection algorithm. For an unfiltered non-return-to-zero (NRZ) pseudorandom sequence, the resolvability of each of the phases in the correlation surface is roughly dependent on the rate at which the coded sequence is transmitted. The resolvability may be improved by increasing the transmission rate, and therefore also bandwidth requirements. However, there are limits to increasing the transmission rate …",

""" TEACHING TABLES I:"" Using In-Class Problems as Formative Assessment Tools","Margaret Hjalmarson, Jill Nelson, Kathleen Wage",2009/10/5,Journal Innovations in Teaching & Learning Conference Proceedings,"In an electrical engineering course for juniors, students devote part of each class period to in-class problems designed to develop their conceptual understanding of significant topics in the course. The students work in small groups on 1-2 problems per class, each for 10-15 minutes. Whole-class discussion follows the problems in order to review solutions and further develop student understanding. The problems help students learn the fundamental concepts of the course. In addition, the discussion helps the instructor understand what students do and do not understand about the problem and allows the instructor to provide just-in-time information in a formative assessment process. The instructor can also use the discussion to highlight particularly important concepts. Analysis of student work has revealed student difficulties with symbols and complex algorithms due to a lack of conceptual knowledge.",
Iterative Stack-Based Detection for Unknown ISI Channels,Jill K Nelson,2007/8/26,Conference 2007 IEEE/SP 14th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing,"We propose a turbo-style receiver for detecting convolutionallyencoded data transmitted over multiple unknown dispersive channels. The receiver employs two Bayesian maximum likelihood sequence detectors (BMLSD), each of which uses a stack-based tree search algorithm to generate an estimate of the transmitted data. The detectors exchange soft information about the underlying bits, thereby reducing the number of branch explorations required to detect a transmitted block. The proposed structure is particularly attractive when receiver memory is limited, as the iterative exchange of priors can overcome the erasures typically associated with small stack size in tree search algorithms. Simulation results show that the turbo-BMLSD receiver achieves significant performance gains over the original BMLSD algorithm and approaches the performance of MLSD for a known channel.",
Bayesian Sequential Detection for the BSC with Unknown Crossover Probability,"Jill K Nelson, Andrew C Singer",2006/7/9,Conference 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory,"We propose a novel scheme for detecting coded data transmitted over a communication channel that is either partially or entirely unknown. Viewing the unknown channel parameters as stochastic quantities drawn from a known probability distribution, the likelihood of a sequence of data is derived using Bayesian techniques. A stack-like tree search algorithm is proposed for implementation of maximum likelihood (ML) sequence detection under the Bayesian metric. We apply the Bayesian scheme to the binary symmetric channel (BSC) with unknown crossover probability. The structure of the resulting metric is compared to both the conventional Fano metric and a universal metric presented in (Lapidoth and Ziv, IEEE Trans. IT 1999). Based on its relationship to the metric developed by Lapidoth and Ziv, the newly-derived metric is shown to be pairwise universal over the ensemble of random uniform codes",

COMPARISON OF NOTCH DEPTH FOR CONSTRAINED LEAST MEAN SQUARES AND DOMINANT MODE REJECTION BEAMFORMERS,"Kathleen E Wage, Jill K Nelson, Janos Gertler",Detection of low power desired signals in the presence of high power interferers is a common problem in spatial signal processing.

ND performance comparison of N-LMS and ER-DMR shows that ER-DMR beamformer attains deeper notch faster than N-LMS both for single multi interferer cases. Although ND performance of ER-DMR places a deeper notch its WNG is same as N-LMS beamformer for both single and multi-interferer cases.

Sequential Blind Detection using Bayesian Techniques,"Jill K Nelson, Andrew C Singer","Receivers for a variety of communication channels must often be designed to operate in the absence of channel information. While a channel estimate may be generated from training data, known data then occupies available spectrum, which is often a scarce resource. We propose a blind maximum likelihood (ML) sequence detection and decoding technique for which the receiver requires no training data or estimate of the channel. The data is encoded via a tree or convolutional code, and the channel is assumed to have a set of unknown parameters that are drawn from a known probability distribution. The likelihood of a sequence of transmitted data is then computed via a Bayesian approach by averaging over the unknown parameters. ML sequence detection is performed via a tree search, allowing the receiver to accumulate information about the channel based on all previously transmitted data. We describe the application of the proposed Bayesian detector and decoder to the intersymbol interference (ISI) channel and show via simulation that it can achieve bit error rates (BER) within 0.25 dB of ML sequence detection for a known channel. We also show that the proposed Bayesian metric is asymptotically equivalent to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) metric that uses an entire sequence of data to generate a channel estimate. In addition, we describe the application of the Bayesian receiver to the binary symmetric channel (BSC) and discuss its relationship to the work presented in [1], which proves that the proposed metric is pairwise universal.","Scholar articles Sequential Blind Detection using Bayesian TechniquesJK Nelson, AC SingerRelated articles ","Receivers for a variety of communication channels must often be designed to operate in the absence of channel information.

Evolution of Priors in the LITE,"J Nelson, R Koetter, A Singer","The linear iterative turbo-equalization (LITE) algorithm provides an iterative means for equalization of ISI channels when two channels are available for transmission. The algorithm passes prior information on the transmitted bits between two linear MMSE equalizers and via this method achieves significant performance gains over schemes such as joint MMSE and decision-feedback equalization. We develop a framework for analyzing the evolution of the distribution over these priors as the LITE algorithm is iterated. To simplify the analysis, we examine a case in which the distribution of the priors is discretized to a five-point PMF and all transmitted bits are equal to 1. Our results demonstrate that for the channel and equalizer length studied, even for low signal to noise ratios, the distribution of the priors converges within four iterations to a PMF with nearly all mass at 1.","Scholar articles Evolution of Priors in the LITEJ Nelson, R Koetter, A SingerRelated articles All 2 versions ","The linear iterative turbo-equalization (LITE) algorithm provides an iterative means for equalization of ISI channels when two channels are available for transmission.
