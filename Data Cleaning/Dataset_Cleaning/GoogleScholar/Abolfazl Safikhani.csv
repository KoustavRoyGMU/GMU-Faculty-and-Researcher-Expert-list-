Joint structural break detection and parameter estimation in high-dimensional nonstationary VAR models,"Abolfazl Safikhani, Ali Shojaie",2022/1/2,Journal Journal of the American Statistical Association,"Assuming stationarity is unrealistic in many time series applications. A more realistic alternative is to assume piecewise stationarity, where the model can change at potentially many change points. We propose a three-stage procedure for simultaneous estimation of change points and parameters of high-dimensional piecewise vector autoregressive (VAR) models. In the first step, we reformulate the change point detection problem as a high-dimensional variable selection one, and solve it using a penalized least square estimator with a total variation penalty. We show that the penalized estimation method over-estimates the number of change points, and propose a selection criterion to identify the change points. In the last step of our procedure, we estimate the VAR parameters in each of the segments. We prove that the proposed procedure consistently detects the number and location of change points, and provides …",56

Investigation on range anxiety and safety buffer of battery electric vehicle drivers,"Quan Yuan, Wei Hao, Haotian Su, Guanwen Bing, Xinyuan Gui, Abolfazl Safikhani",2018/6/13,Journal Journal of Advanced Transportation,"Drivers tend to have more range anxiety compared with driving traditional fuel vehicles if they are driving battery electric vehicle (BEV) with a long trip. Range anxiety could potentially have negative effect on driver’s emotions and behaviors. In order to understand this behavior and improve the related safety issues, this paper will focus on BEV drivers’ study in China. A survey on BEV drivers’ actual range anxiety as well as the effect of range anxiety on drivers’ behaviors is conducted in this research. Levels of feelings and attitudes of the interviewees are quantized with Likert scales using mathematical tools of the relationship. Safety buffer is defined as a measurement of the period given range anxiety starting to significantly intervene in driver’s operation. The research reveals the proportional quotative relationship between BEV drivers’ safety buffer and the mileage of trip. Factors, including driving experience, satisfactory level of recharge accessibility, and resistibility to emotions, are found to be significant contributing factors to influence the perceived range anxiety level of BEV drivers.

Cycle-length prediction in actuated traffic-signal control using ARIMA model,"Bahman Moghimi, Abolfazl Safikhani, Camille Kamga, Wei Hao",2018/3/1,Journal Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering,"In urban transportation systems, the traffic signal is the main component in controlling traffic congestion. Using actuated traffic control as one of the traffic-controlling systems can cause fewer delays for transportation users, specifically when it comes to an isolated intersection. Although actuated signal control has many benefits, the prediction of cycle length is cumbersome because it varies from time to time. The value of signal cycle length in actuated control depends on many parameters. In this research, the authors attempted to understand whether any dependence existed between the current value of the cycle length and its previous values. To capture the dependence among cycle length data, time series analysis was applied over the data, which were obtained from the simulated fully actuated signal.

Non-stationary Spatio-Temporal Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in The US,"Yue Bai, Abolfazl Safikhani, George Michailidis",2020/9/18,Journal medRxiv,"The fast transmission rate of COVID-19 worldwide has made this virus the most important challenge of year 2020. Many mitigation policies have been imposed by the governments at different regional levels (country, state, county, and city) to stop the spread of this virus. Quantifying the effect of such mitigation strategies on the transmission and recovery rates, and predicting the rate of new daily cases are two crucial tasks. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework which not only accounts for such policies but also utilizes the spatial and temporal information to characterize the pattern of COVID-19 progression. Specifically, a piecewise susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is developed while the dates at which the transmission/recover rates change significantly are defined as “break points” in this model. A novel and data-driven algorithm is designed to locate the break points using ideas from fused lasso and thresholding. In order to enhance the forecasting power and to describe additional temporal dependence among the daily number of cases, this model is further coupled with spatial smoothing covariates and vector auto-regressive (VAR) model. The proposed model is applied to several U.S. states and counties, and the results confirm the effect of “stay-at-home orders” and some states’ early “re-openings” by detecting break points close to such events. Further, the model performed satisfactorily short-term forecasts of the number of new daily cases at regional levels by utilizing the estimated spatio-temporal covariance structures.

Theoretical analysis of deep neural networks for temporally dependent observations,"Mingliang Ma, Abolfazl Safikhani",2022/10/20,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.11530,"Deep neural networks are powerful tools to model observations over time with non-linear patterns. Despite the widespread use of neural networks in such settings, most theoretical developments of deep neural networks are under the assumption of independent observations, and theoretical results for temporally dependent observations are scarce. To bridge this gap, we study theoretical properties of deep neural networks on modeling non-linear time series data. Specifically, non-asymptotic bounds for prediction error of (sparse) feed-forward neural network with ReLU activation function is established under mixing-type assumptions. These assumptions are mild such that they include a wide range of time series models including auto-regressive models. Compared to independent observations, established convergence rates have additional logarithmic factors to compensate for additional complexity due to dependence among data points. The theoretical results are supported via various numerical simulation settings as well as an application to a macroeconomic data set.",3

Most literature develop a variety of separate methods designed for specified models (e.g. mean shift model, vector auto-regressive model, graphical model). In this paper, we provide a unified framework for structural break detection which is suitable for a large class of models. Moreover, the proposed algorithm automatically achieves consistent parameter estimates during the change point detection process, without the need for refitting the model. Specifically, we introduce a three-step procedure. The first step utilizes the block segmentation strategy combined with a fused lasso based estimation criterion, leads to significant computational gains without compromising the statistical accuracy in identifying the number and location of the structural breaks. This procedure is further coupled with hard-thresholding and exhaustive search steps to consistently estimate the number and location of the break points. The strong guarantees are proved on both the number of estimated change points and the rates of convergence of their locations. The consistent estimates of model parameters are also provided.

Fast and scalable algorithm for detection of structural breaks in big var models,"Abolfazl Safikhani, Yue Bai, George Michailidis",2022/1/2,Journal Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics,"Many real time series datasets exhibit structural changes over time.

An additional challenge emerges in the presence of very large datasets, namely on how to accomplish these two objectives in a computational efficient manner. In this article, we propose a novel procedure which leverages a block segmentation scheme (BSS) that reduces the number of model parameters to be estimated through a regularized least-square criterion.

This paper proposes a data-driven weighted l1 regularized approach for spatio-temporal VAR model. Extensive simulation studies are carried out to compare the proposed method with four existing methods of high-dimensional VAR model, demonstrating improvements of our method over others in parameter estimation, network detection and out-of-sample forecasts.

Covariance tapering for anisotropic nonstationary gaussian random fields with application to large scale spatial data sets,"Abolfazl Safikhani, Yimin Xiao",2014,Journal Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Spatial Accuracy,"Estimating the covariance structure of spatial random processes is an important step in spatial data analysis. Maximum likelihood estimation is a popular method in spatial models based on Gaussian random fields. But calculating the likelihood in large scale data sets is computationally infeasible due to the heavy computation of the precision matrix. One way to mitigate this issue, which is due to Furrer et al.(2006), is to “taper” the covariance matrix. While most of the results in the current literature focus on isotropic tapering for stationary Gaussian processes, there are many cases in application that require modeling of anisotropy and/or nonstationarity. In this article, we propose a nonstationary parametric model, in which the underlying Gaussian random field may have different regularities in different directions, thus can be applied to model anisotropy. Using the theory of equivalence of Gaussian measures under nonstationary assumption, strong consistency of the tapered likelihood based estimation of the variance component under fixed domain asymptotics are derived by putting mild conditions on the spectral behavior of the tapering covariance function.

On uncertainty estimation in functional linear mixed models,"Tapabrata Maiti, Abolfazl Safikhani, Ping‐Shou Zhong",2021/9,Journal Canadian Journal of Statistics,"Functional data analysis has proven useful in many scientific applications where a physical process is observed as a curve. In many applications, several curves are observed due to multiple subjects, providing replicates in the statistical sense. Recent literature develops several techniques for registering curves and estimating associated models in a regression framework. Standard regression models ignore heterogeneity among curves. Functional linear mixed models are one popular way to combine several curves and capture variability among curves via random effects. Although there is a good amount of work available for analyzing functional data using mixed models, limited attention has been paid to inference. After estimation, we concentrate on measuring uncertainty in terms of mean squared error when functional linear mixed models are used for prediction. Although measuring uncertainty is of paramount …",

Inference on the change point in high dimensional time series models via plug in least squares,"Abhishek Kaul, Stergios B Fotopoulos, Venkata K Jandhyala, Abolfazl Safikhani",2020/7/3,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.01888,"We study a plug in least squares estimator for the change point parameter where change is in the mean of a high dimensional random vector under subgaussian or subexponential distributions. We obtain sufficient conditions under which this estimator possesses sufficient adaptivity against plug in estimates of mean parameters in order to yield an optimal rate of convergence  in the integer scale. This rate is preserved while allowing high dimensionality as well as a potentially diminishing jump size  provided  or  in the subgaussian and subexponential cases, respectively. Here  and  represent a sparsity parameter, model dimension, sampling period and the separation of the change point from its parametric boundary. Moreover, since the rate of convergence is free of  and logarithmic terms of  it allows the existence of limiting distributions. These distributions are then derived as the {\it argmax} of a two sided negative drift Brownian motion or a two sided negative drift random walk under vanishing and non-vanishing jump size regimes, respectively. Thereby allowing inference of the change point parameter in the high dimensional setting. Feasible algorithms for implementation of the proposed methodology are provided. Theoretical results are supported with monte-carlo simulations.",
Uncertainty Estimation in Functional Linear Models,"Tapabrata Maiti, Abolfazl Safikhani, Ping-Shou Zhong",2018/1/29,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.09338,"Functional data analysis is proved to be useful in many scientific applications. The physical process is observed as curves and often there are several curves observed due to multiple subjects, providing the replicates in statistical sense. The recent literature develops several techniques for registering the curves and associated model estimation. However, very little has been investigated for statistical inference, specifically uncertainty estimation. In this article, we consider functional linear mixed modeling approach to combine several curves. We concentrate measuring uncertainty when the functional linear mixed models are used for prediction. Although measuring the uncertainty is paramount interest in any statistical prediction, there is no closed form expression available for functional mixed effects models. In many real life applications only a finite number of curves can be observed. In such situations it is important to asses the error rate for any valid statistical statement. We derive theoretically valid approximation of uncertainty measurements that are suitable along with modified estimation techniques. We illustrate our methods by numerical examples and compared with other existing literature as appropriate. Our method is computationally simple and often outperforms the other methods.",
Research Article Investigation on Range Anxiety and Safety Buffer of Battery Electric Vehicle Drivers,"Quan Yuan, Wei Hao, Haotian Su, Guanwen Bing, Xinyuan Gui, Abolfazl Safikhani",2018,"Description Drivers tend to have more range anxiety compared with driving traditional fuel vehicles if they are driving battery electric vehicle (BEV) with a long trip. Range anxiety could potentially have negative effect on driver’s emotions and behaviors. In order to understand this behavior and improve the related safety issues, this paper will focus on BEV drivers’ study in China. A survey on BEV drivers’ actual range anxiety as well as the effect of range anxiety on drivers’ behaviors is conducted in this research. Levels of feelings and attitudes of the interviewees are quantized with Likert scales using mathematical tools of the relationship. Safety buffer is defined as a measurement of the period given range anxiety starting to significantly intervene in driver’s operation. The research reveals the proportional quotative relationship between BEV drivers’ safety buffer and the mileage of trip. Factors, including driving experience, satisfactory level of recharge accessibility, and resistibility to emotions, are found to be significant contributing factors to influence the perceived range anxiety level of BEV drivers. This research will provide implications to the future study on the interface design of BEV.","Drivers tend to have more range anxiety compared with driving traditional fuel vehicles if they are driving battery electric vehicle (BEV) with a long trip.

Predicting Short-Term Uber Demand Using Spatio-Temporal Modeling: A New York City Case Study,"Sabiheh Sadat Faghih, Abolfazl Safikhani, Bahman Moghimi, Camille Kamga",2017/12,Journal arXiv e-prints,"The demand for e-hailing services is growing rapidly, especially in large cities. Uber is the first and popular e-hailing company in the United Stated and New York City. A comparison of the demand for yellow-cabs and Uber in NYC in 2014 and 2015 shows that the demand for Uber has increased. However, this demand may not be distributed uniformly either spatially or temporally. Using spatio-temporal time series models can help us to better understand the demand for e-hailing services and to predict it more accurately. This paper analyzes the prediction performance of one temporal model (vector autoregressive (VAR)) and two spatio-temporal models (Spatial-temporal autoregressive (STAR); least absolute shrinkage and selection operator applied on STAR (LASSO-STAR)) and for different scenarios (based on the number of time and space lags), and applied to both rush hours and non-rush hours periods.
