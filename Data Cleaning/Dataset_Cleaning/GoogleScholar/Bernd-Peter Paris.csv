Neural networks for multiuser detection in code-division multiple-access communications,"Behnaam Aazhang, B-P Paris, Geoffrey C Orsak",1992/7,"Journal Communications, IEEE Transactions on","Two simple structures employing multilayer perceptrons are proposed for demodulation of spread-spectrum signals in both synchronous and asynchronous Gaussian channels. The optimum receiver is used to benchmark the performance of the proposed receiver; in particular, it is proved to be instrumental in identifying the decision regions for the neural networks. The neutral networks are trained for the demodulation of signals via backpropagation-type algorithms. A modified backpropagation-type algorithm is introduced for single-user and multiuser detection with near-optimum performance that could have applications in other classification and pattern recognition problems. A comparative performance analysis of the three receivers, optimum, conventional, and the one employing neural networks, is carried out via Monte Carlo simulations.

Finite Precision Decorrelating Receivers for Multi-User CDMA Communication Systems,Bernd-Peter Paris,1994/6,Conference 1994 International Symposium on Information Theory,"The design of single-user decorrelating receivers employing finite-precision sequences for despreading is considered. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear bounded integer optimization problem which is shown to be network performance (NP)-hard. A branch-and-bound algorithm for finding the best finite-precision decorrelating sequence is described. Numerical examples demonstrate that the loss in performance between the optimum, infinite-precision, and the best finite-precision decorrelator is small even for large channel occupancies. Some suboptimum algorithms are investigated which greatly reduce the computational complexity associated with finding good finite precision decorrelator sequences.",36
Measuring the size of the Internet via importance sampling,"Song Xing, B-P Paris",2003/8/4,Journal IEEE journal on selected areas in communications,"Measuring the size of the Internet via Monte Carlo sampling requires probing a large portion of the Internet protocol (IP) address space to obtain an accurate estimate. However, the distribution of information servers on the Internet is highly nonuniform over the IP address space. This allows us to design probing strategies based on importance sampling for measuring the prevalence of an information service on the Internet that are significantly more effective than strategies relying on Monte Carlo sampling. We present thorough analysis of our strategies together with accurate estimates for the current size of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) Internet as measured by the number of publicly accessible web servers and FTP servers.",28

Near-optimum control of multiple-access collision channels,"B-P Paris, Behnaam Aazhang",1992/8,Journal IEEE transactions on communications,"A method based on recursive computation of the expected number of attempts and successes during the collision resolution phase of an access control algorithm is introduced for the design of near-optimum control strategies for multiple access collision channels with ternary and binary feedback. With this approach it is possible to circumvent the extremely difficult and still unsolved problem of finding the access control algorithm which achieves the highest throughput by settling for a near-optimum solution. The key to the design of the algorithms is to approximate the originally infinite-dimensional optimization problem by a one-dimensional optimization problem. In the ternary feedback case, the proposed algorithm achieves a throughput virtually identical to the highest throughput reported. Several forms of binary feedback are considered, and algorithms are introduced that achieve the highest throughput reported.< >",26
On the relationship between measures of discrimination and the performance of suboptimal detectors,"Geoffrey C Orsak, B-P Paris",1995/1,Journal IEEE transactions on information theory,"The problem of designing and analyzing suboptimal detectors via statistical distance measures is considered. As a preliminary result, we show that only the minimum and maximum probability of error are valid measures of discrimination between the input statistics. This result would seem then to imply that the use of distance measures in this context can be inappropriate. However, to overcome this apparent obstacle, we demonstrate explicit relationships between various f-divergences and the loss in performance of an arbitrary detector relative to the optimal detector. In particular, we establish both upper and lower bounds on the performance loss of a suboptimal detector in terms of the ""distance"" between the pertinent statistics of both the optimal and suboptimal detectors. While designing detectors by minimizing these upper bounds can be an elusive task, in many practical cases, the lower bound presented herein …",21

Neural net receivers in multiple access-communications,"Bernd-Peter Paris, Geoffrey Orsak, Mahesh Varanasi, Behnaam Aazhang",1988,Journal Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,"The application of neural networks to the demodulation of spread-spectrum signals in a multiple-access environment is considered. This study is motivated in large part by the fact that, in a multiuser system, the conventional (matched fil (cid: 173) ter) receiver suffers severe performance degradation as the relative powers of the interfering signals become large (the"" near-far"" problem). Furthermore, the optimum receiver, which alleviates the near-far problem, is too complex to be of practical use.

Performance analysis of MIMO receivers under imperfect CSIT,"Shyam Pandula, Bernd-Peter Paris",2007/3/14,Conference 2007 41st Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems,"This paper considers spatial multiplexing (SM) systems with preceding. The precoder is derived from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the available channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and the receiver is a function of the precoder and the current channel. With perfect CSIT, the M R xM T  flat-fading MIMO channel can be decomposed into mm(M T ,M R ) parallel spatial subchannels. However in practice, the available CSIT suffers from delay-induced error due to the channel temporal variations. Using this outdated CSIT for precoding in SM systems causes interference among the subchannels. Performance of the decorrelator, minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and successive interference cancelation (SIC) receivers is analyzed as the reliability of the available CSIT varies.

A Probabilistic Ontology for Large-Scale IP Geolocation.,"Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, Sudhanshu Chandekar, Bernd-Peter Paris",2015,Conference STIDS,"Mapping IP addresses to physical locations is important for a host of cyber security applications. Examples include identifying the origin of cyber attacks, protecting against fraud in internet commerce, screening emails for phishing, and enforcing restrictions on commerce with sanctioned countries. Simultaneous geolocation of large numbers of IP hosts is needed for cyber situation awareness. Explicit formal representation of the geospatial aspects of the cyber domain is necessary for interoperation with other cyber security capabilities. Formally representing the uncertainty inherent in geolocation supports increased accuracy via information fusion, as well as integration of geospatial inference with inference about other aspects of the cyber landscape. This paper presents a probabilistic ontology (PO) for IP geolocation. The geolocation PO is represented in the PR-OWL language, which allows an OWL ontology to be augmented with information to support uncertainty management. We show how the PR-OWL ontology supports automated construction of a Bayesian network for simultaneously geolocating a large number of IP hosts. The ultimate aim is to integrate our probabilistic ontology into a comprehensive cyber security probabilistic ontology to support cyber situation awareness, predictive modeling, and response strategy definition.",4

Access methods,Bernd-Peter Paris,2018/10/8,Book The Communications Handbook,"69.1 Introduction The radio channel is fundamentally a broadcast communication medium. Therefore, signals transmitted by one user can potentially be received by all other users within range of the transmitter. Although this high connectivity is very useful in some applications, like broadcast radio or television, it requires stringent access control in wireless communication systems to avoid, or at least to limit, interference between transmissions. Throughout, the term wireless communication systems is taken to mean communication systems that facilitate two-way communication between a portable radio communication terminal and the fixed network infrastructure. Such systems range from mobile cellular systems through personal communication systems (PCS) to cordless telephones.",3
Channel order estimation via sample sorting,"Simon G Wood, Bernd-Peter Paris, Jill K Nelson",2011/3/23,Conference 2011 45th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems,We present a computationally efficient channel order estimation technique that can be used as a first step in blind channel estimation and equalization. Our approach is based entirely on context sorting inter-symbol interference corrupted samples. This leads to high computational efficiency when compared to other standard techniques that rely on second-order correlation statistics. In addition to demonstrating the computational efficiency of our approach we also show that it has superior estimation performance in comparison to other techniques presented in the literature in recent years.,3

Precoder design via approximate joint diagonalization for ricean correlated MIMO channels in STBC systems,"Shyam Pandula, Bernd-Peter Paris",2008/3/19,Conference 2008 42nd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems,"We present a novel linear precoder design based on the minimum pair-wise error probability (PEP) criterion for general space-time block coded (STBC) MIMO systems. The channel state information at the transmitter consists of the channel mean and transmit antenna correlation matrices. Approximate joint diagonalization reveals the ""average eigenstructure"" shared by the mean and correlation matrices. These average eigenvectors turn out to be the left singular vectors of the precoder matrix. The right singular vectors of the precoder matrix depend on the space-time code. The singular values correspond to the power allocated to each mode, which depends on the channel statistics and the space-time code. Precoder design examples for a non-orthogonal STBCs and simulation results are provided to illustrate the achieved performance gain.",3

Matched subspace detectors for distinguishing between two signals with extensions to blind maximum likelihood sequence estimation,"Bernd-Peter Paris, Ali R Shah",1995/3,Journal Proceedzngs of the 29-th Annual Conference on Informatzon Sczence and Systems,The problem of distinguishing between two signals when only a ltered version of the transmitted signals is available and the coe cients of the lter are unknown gives rise to matched subspace detector. In this paper we will investigate the performance of matched subspace detectors for distinguishing between two signals. We will demonstrate that the matched subspace detector is equivalent to a GLRT and that it utilizes the maximally invariant statistic for the problem. Exponentially tight upper bounds on the error rate are derived and performance relative to the matched lter is analyzed in the high SNR regime.,3
Asymptotic properties of self-adaptive maximum-likelihood sequence estimation,Bernd-Peter Paris,1993/3,"Journal Proceedings of the 27-th Annual Conference on Information Science and Systems,(Baltimore, MD), Johns Hopkins University","The problem of estimating the most likely state sequence of a discrete-time finite-state Markov process with unknown parameters observed in independent noise arises in many important problems in digital communications, including self-adaptive equalization and adaptive multi-user detection. A maximum likelihood criterion over both the input sequence and the parameters is introduced for estimating the state sequence without using an embedded training sequence. Asymptotically, this estimator is close to the maximum-likelihood sequence estimator with completely known parameters. To facilitate the search for the most likely state sequence, we introduce computationally simple algorithms which are guaranteed to converge. Performance of the self-adaptive maximum-likelihood sequence estimator for the blind equalization problem is illustrated through numerical examples.",3
Distributed multi-cell power control in transmit beamforming systems using intercell-interference plus noise estimates,"Shyam Pandula, Bernd-Peter Paris",2011/3/23,Conference 2011 45th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems,"We address the problem of distributed multi-cell power control in multi-user transmit beamforming systems. The transmit beamforming vectors are obtained by exploiting the multi-cell uplink-downlink duality, and for fixed beamformers, the downlink power is allocated so as to satisfy certain per user SINR constraints with minimal total power. The proposed scheme is based on measurement of real-time intercell-interference plus noise (I+N) at the users using an interference projection technique. At each base station (BS), locally available information and the intercell I+N reports from the users can be combined to implement improved distributed multi-cell power control.

Capacity optimization for Ricean correlated MIMO channels with decorrelator receiver,"Shyam Pandula, Bernd-Peter Paris",2008/3/19,Conference 2008 42nd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems,"This paper addresses the capacity optimization problem for MIMO wireless channels with a non-zero mean and transmit antenna correlation. With a decorrelator receiver, the capacity of the MIMO system is a function of the diagonal elements of an inverted noncentral Wishart distributed matrix. Hence, finding the average capacity is difficult. We simplify the problem by approximating the SNR of each spatial stream by a standard noncentral Chi-squared random variable. Using the moments of the SNR, we obtain a Taylor series approximation for the average capacity that is significantly better than the commonly used bound via Jensen's inequality. The obtained Taylor series approximation is used to design a linear precoder that maximizes the total average capacity of the system. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance gain.",2

In this work, we focus on the problem of simultaneously geolocating large numbers of IP hosts to within a discrete set of geographical regions. Towards this objective, we present a fusion algorithm that combines information from multiple, heterogeneous sources of location information. Our algorithm estimates the most likely region for all hosts simultaneously. A key component of the algorithm is a systematic procedure for automatically constructing factor graphs to perform information fusion from a collection of delay measurements between hosts.

Adaptive stochastic sensor scheduling for multi-channel radio environment mapping,"Joseph Ryan Crawford, Bernd-Peter Paris",2014/12/3,Conference 2014 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP),"This paper addresses the problem of scheduling a distributed set of RF sensors for the creation of a multichannel Radio Environment Map (REM). We propose a method for tracking the spatial distribution of the activity patterns on each channel via Kaiman filtering. The activity patterns on each channel are then used to inform schedule creation by balancing the achievable expected uncertainty across all channels by using the concepts of Permissible Consecutive Observation Loss (PCOL) and Least Consecutive Observation (LCO). For a stationary wireless sensor network, where each sensor can scan one channel at a time, we create an adaptive stochastic channel sensing order that balances the spatial uncertainty of the estimate of the REM for each of the channels of interest.

Practical Methods for Joint Time and Carrier Synchronization in LPI/LPD Communications,"Haotian Zhai, Bernd-Peter Paris",2022/11/28,Conference MILCOM 2022-2022 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM),"To operate at low SNR, LPI/LPD communication systems rely on coherent processing which requires that the receiver is precisely synchronized in time, frequency and phase.

As such, there has been increasing interest in the development of design techniques for determining “good” suboptimal detection strategies. One effective approach to designing detection strategies has been the optimization of a statistical distance measure between competing hypotheses. The advantage of this approach over minimizing the total probability of error is that these dis tance measures can be computed while for most problems, the minimum error rate is analytically intractable. Unfortunately, system parameters derived in this manner are not necessarily optimal in the minimum probability of error sense.

On the capacity of infinite population random multiple access collision channels,Bernd-Peter Paris,1991,Institution Rice University,"The task of controlling the access to a shared communication medium is addressed. More specifically, the problem of finding the control strategy which maximizes the throughput is considered for the infinite population multiple access collision channel. A new method for the efficient design and analysis of access control strategies is presented. This method is based on the recursive computation of the expected number of attempted and successful transmissions during the collision resolution phase of these strategies. It is shown that the throughput of any splitting algorithm can be improved if, instead of transmitting a set which contains exactly one packet with high probability by itself, this set is transmitted together with a subset of another collision set. This observation implies that splitting algorithms are not optimum. Besides establishing a new lower bound for the capacity of the channel, the new strategy is …",
