Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Chance-Constrained Optimization with Wasserstein Metric,"Ran Ji, Miguel Lejeune",2021,Journal Journal of Global Optimization,"We study distributionally robust chance-constrained programming (DRCCP) optimization problems with data-driven Wasserstein ambiguity sets. The proposed algorithmic and reformulation framework applies to all types of distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization problems subjected to individual as well as joint chance constraints, with random right-hand side and technology vector, and under two types of uncertainties, called uncertain probabilities and continuum of realizations. For the uncertain probabilities (UP) case, we provide new mixed-integer linear programming reformulations for DRCCP problems. For the continuum of realizations case with random right-hand side, we propose an exact mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) reformulation and a linear programming (LP) outer approximation. For the continuum of realizations (CR) case with random technology …",50
Data-driven optimization of reward-risk ratio measures,"Ran Ji, Miguel A Lejeune",2020/11/18,Journal INFORMS Journal on Computing,"We investigate a class of fractional distributionally robust optimization problems with uncertain probabilities. They consist in the maximization of ambiguous fractional functions representing reward-risk ratios and have a semi-infinite programming epigraphic formulation. We derive a new fully parameterized closed-form to compute a new bound on the size of the Wasserstein ambiguity ball. We design a data-driven reformulation and solution framework. The reformulation phase involves the derivation of the support function of the ambiguity set and the concave conjugate of the ratio function. We design modular bisection algorithms which enjoy the finite convergence property. This class of problems has wide applicability in finance, and we specify new ambiguous portfolio optimization models for the Sharpe and Omega ratios. The computational study shows the applicability and scalability of the framework to solve …",30
Risk-budgeting multi-portfolio optimization with portfolio and marginal risk constraints,"Ran Ji, Miguel A Lejeune",2018/3,Journal Annals of Operations Research,Multi-portfolio optimization problems and the incorporation of marginal risk contribution constraints have recently received a sustained interest from academia and financial practitioners. We propose a class of new stochastic risk budgeting multi-portfolio optimization models that impose portfolio as well as marginal risk constraints. The models permit the simultaneous and integrated optimization of multiple sub-portfolios in which the marginal risk contribution of each individual security is accounted for. A risk budget defined with a downside risk measure is allocated to each security. We consider the two cases in which the asset universes of the sub-portfolios are either disjoint (diversification of style) or overlap (diversification of judgment). The proposed models take the form of stochastic programming problems and include each a probabilistic constraint with multi-row random technology matrix. We expand a …,25
"Properties, formulations, and algorithms for portfolio optimization using Mean-Gini criteria","Ran Ji, Miguel A Lejeune, Srinivas Y Prasad",2017/1,Journal Annals of Operations Research,"We study an extended set of Mean-Gini portfolio optimization models that encompasses a general version of the mean-risk formulation, the Minimal Gini model (MinG) that minimizes Gini’s Mean Differences, and the new risk-adjusted Mean-Gini Ratio (MGR) model. We analyze the properties of the various models, prove that a performance measure based on a Risk Adjusted version of the Mean Gini Ratio (RAMGR) is coherent, and establish the equivalence between maximizing this performance measure and solving for the maximal Mean-Gini ratio. We propose a linearization approach for the fractional programming formulation of the MGR model. We also conduct a thorough evaluation of the various Mean-Gini models based on four data sets that represent combinations of bullish and bearish scenarios in the in-sample and out-of-sample phases. The performance is (i) analyzed with respect to eight return …",15
A machine learning integrated portfolio rebalance framework with risk-aversion adjustment,"Zhenlong Jiang, Ran Ji, Kuo-Chu Chang",2020/7/16,Journal Journal of Risk and Financial Management,"We propose a portfolio rebalance framework that integrates machine learning models into the mean-risk portfolios in multi-period settings with risk-aversion adjustment. In each period, the risk-aversion coefficient is adjusted automatically according to market trend movements predicted by machine learning models. We employ Gini’s Mean Difference (GMD) to specify the risk of a portfolio and use a set of technical indicators generated from a market index (e.g., S&P 500 index) to feed the machine learning models to predict market movements. Using a rolling-horizon approach, we conduct a series of computational tests with real financial data to evaluate the performance of the machine learning integrated portfolio rebalance framework. The empirical results show that the XGBoost model provides the best prediction of market movement, while the proposed portfolio rebalance strategy generates portfolios with superior out-of-sample performances in terms of average returns, time-series cumulative returns, and annualized returns compared to the benchmarks.",10
Distributionally Robust Portfolio Optimization with Linearized STARR Performance Measure,"Ran Ji, Miguel Lejeune, Zhengyang Fan",2021/7/14,Journal Quantitative Finance,"We study the distributionally robust linearized stable tail adjusted return ratio (DRLSTARR) portfolio optimization problem, in which the objective is to maximize the worst-case linearized stable tail adjusted return ratio (LSTARR) performance measure under data-driven Wasserstein ambiguity. We consider two types of imperfectly known uncertainties, named uncertain probabilities and continuum of realizations, associated with the losses of assets. We account for two typical combinatorial trading constraints, called buy-in threshold and diversification constraints, to reflect stock market restrictions. Leveraging conic duality theory to tackle the distributionally robust worst-case expectation, the proposed problems are reformulated into mixed-integer linear programming problems. We carry out a series of empirical tests to illustrate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed solution framework, and to evaluate the …",6
Newsvendor Model as an Exchange Option on Demand and Supply Uncertainty,"Ran Ji, Bardia Kamrad",2019/10,Journal Production and Operations Management,"Using a contingent claims framework, we develop a single period model in the context of an exchange option in a discounted value maximization setting. Given this framework, we study the classic problem of determining stockpiling levels prior to demand realization when the procured/produced levels are subject to random yield variations. In this set up, both demand and yield variables are modeled as Wiener processes. A pure noise (zero drift) process initially models yield dynamics. Later, we consider improving the average yield rates, subsidized through increasing unit costs in a constrained cost environment. In either case, “yield adjusted” critical fractiles, the optimal order/production levels, and their corresponding expected values are established. As a special case, we relax the yield uncertainty constraint and instead use the long‐term average yield estimate to assess the yield's impact on production …",5
A distributionally robust chance-constrained model for humanitarian relief network design,"Zhenlong Jiang, Ran Ji, Sasha Dong",2021/9/14,Journal Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3929286,"We propose a novel two-stage distributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DRJCC) model to design a resilient humanitarian relief network with uncertainties in demand and unit allocation cost of relief items in the post-disaster environment. This model determines the locations of the supply facilities with pre-positioning inventory levels and the transportation plans. We investigate the problem under two types of ambiguity sets: moment-based ambiguity and Wasserstein ambiguity. For moment-based ambiguity, we reformulate the problem into a mixed-integer conic program and solve it efficiently via a sequential optimization procedure by finding the optimal scaling parameters iteratively. For Wasserstein ambiguity, we reformulate the problem into a mixed-integer linear program. We conduct comprehensive numerical experiments to assess the computational efficiency of the proposed reformulation and algorithmic framework, and evaluate the reliability of the generated network by the proposed model. Through a case study in the Gulf Coast area, we demonstrate that the DRJCC model under Wasserstein ambiguity achieves a better trade-off between cost and network reliability in out-of-sample tests than the moment-based DRJCC model and the classical stochastic programming model.",4
Dynamic portfolio optimization with risk-aversion adjustment utilizing technical indicators,"Ran Ji, Miguel A Lejeune, Srinivas Y Prasad",2017/7/10,Conference 2017 20th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion),"We propose a dynamic portfolio rebalancing approach within the mean-risk framework, in which the riskaversion coefficient is adjusted according to market trend information captured by a technical indicator. We employ Gini's Mean Difference as the risk measure and the moving average as the technical indicator. We conduct a thorough empirical evaluation with a rolling horizon approach using the S&P 500 market data. The empirical results reveal that the proposed portfolio rebalancing strategy with time-varying risk-aversion adjustments generates portfolios with higher returns than those obtained with a strategy in which the risk-aversion coefficient is fixed.",4
"Integrated supplier selection, scheduling, and routing problem for perishable product supply chain: A distributionally robust approach","Omid Hashemi-Amiri, Fahimeh Ghorbani, Ran Ji",2023/1/1,Journal Computers & Industrial Engineering,"Due to the global outbreak of COVID-19, the perishable product supply chains have been impacted in different ways, and consequently, the risks of food insecurity have been increased in many affected countries. The uncertainty in supply and demand of perishable products, are among the most influential factors impacting the supply chain networks. Accordingly, the provision and distribution of food and other perishable commodities have become much more important than in the past. In this study, a bi-objective optimization model is proposed for a three-echelon perishable food supply chain (PFSC) network with multiple products to formulate an integrated supplier selection, production scheduling, and vehicle routing problem. The proposed model aims to mitigate the risks of demand and supply uncertainties and reinforce the distribution-related decisions by simultaneously optimizing the total network costs and …",3
Interactive Portfolio Optimization Using Mean-Gini Criteria,"Ran Ji, Miguel A Lejeune, Srinivas Y Prasad","We study a multi-objective portfolio optimization model that employs two conflicting objectives–maximizing mean return, and minimizing risk as measured by the Gini Mean Difference (GMD). We assume that an investor's implicit utility is a function of these two objectives and help the investor identify the optimal (ie, most preferred) portfolio among the efficient ones. We develop an interactive solution procedure based on the concept of domination cones that can be used with a class of utility functions defined over Mean-Gini criteria. The investor's preferences are elicited interactively through pairwise comparisons of efficient Mean-Gini portfolios based on which domination cones are derived to guide the search for the most preferred portfolio.

Risk-aversion adjusted portfolio optimization with predictive modeling,"Ran Ji, KC Chang, Zhenlong Jiang",2019/7/2,Conference 2019 22th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION),"We propose a multi-period portfolio optimization method rooted on the mean-risk framework, in which the risk-aversion coefficient is adjusted in response to the market trend movement predicted by machine learning models. We use the Gini's Mean Difference to characterize the risk of the portfolio, and employ a series of technical indicators as the features to feed the predictive machine learning models. A set of comprehensive computational tests are carried out within a rolling-horizon approach to evaluate the performance of the generated portfolios. The empirical results show that the regularized logistic regression model provides the best prediction of market trend movement, while the proposed dynamic risk-aversion adjusted portfolio rebalancing strategy generates portfolios with higher time-series cumulative returns than a static strategy with fixed risk-aversion coefficient.",1
Predicting Household Disaster Preparedness: An Integrated Machine Learning and Simulation Framework,"Zhenlong Jiang, Yudi Chen, Ting-Yeh Yang, Wenying Ji, Sasha Zhijie Dong, Ran Ji",2023/3/3,Publisher Preprints,"Effective household and individual disaster preparedness can minimize physical harm and property damage during catastrophic events. To assess the risk and vulnerability of affected areas, it is crucial for relief agencies to understand the level of public preparedness. Traditionally, government agencies have employed nationwide random telephone surveys to gauge the public’s attitudes and actions towards disaster preparedness. However, these surveys may lack generalizability in certain affected locations due to low response rates or areas not covered by the survey. To address this issue and enhance the comprehensiveness of disaster preparedness assessments, we develop a framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning and simulation. Our approach leverages machine learning algorithms to establish relationships between public attitudes towards disaster preparedness and demographic characteristics. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we generate datasets that incorporate demographic information of the affected location based on government-provided demographic distribution data. The generated dataset is then input into the machine learning model to predict the disaster preparedness attitudes of the affected population. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to Miami-Dade County, where it accurately predicts the level of disaster preparedness. With this innovative approach, relief agencies can have a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of public disaster preparedness.",
Novel Integer L-shaped Method for Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem under Uncertain Sequence-Dependent Setups,"Zhengyang Fan, Ran Ji, Shi-Chung Chang, Kuo-Chu Chang",2022/12,Journal Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4311594,"We study scheduling problems on unrelated parallel machines with uncertainty in job processing and sequence-dependent setup times. We first formulate the problem into a scenario-based two-stage stochastic program, where the first stage decisions are job-machine assignment, and the second stage decisions are job sequencing. We then design a novel modified integer L-shaped method which (i) decomposes the overall problem into independent sub-problems in both scenario and machine levels, and (ii) incorporates a specialized integer optimality cut that is strengthened via the sequential lifting procedure. We further generalize our proposed model and solution method to the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) counterpart under Wasserstein ambiguity. We first equivalently reformulate the DRO model into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by exploiting conic duality theory. We then incorporate a distribution separation program to specify the worst-case probability distribution at each iteration of the proposed integer L-shaped method to foster computational speed for solving the DRO model. We conduct a series of numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed solution methodology. Computational results showed that, for problem instances that are solved to exactness within the time limit, our novel decomposition algorithms achieve solution times up to two orders of magnitudes faster than using classical integer L-shaped method for the stochastic scheduling model and the direct MILP reformulation of the DRO model. Furthermore, the solution from DRO model displayed more robust …",
Distributionally Robust Portfolio Optimization under Marginal and Copula Ambiguity,"Zhengyang Fan, Ran Ji, Miguel A Lejeune",2022/12,Journal Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4300358,"We investigate a new family of distributionally robust optimization problem under marginal and copula ambiguity with applications to portfolio optimization problems. The proposed model considers the ambiguity set of portfolio return in which the marginal distributions and their copula are close--in terms of the Wasserstein distance--to their nominal counterparts. We develop a cutting-surface method to solve the proposed problem, in which the distribution separation subproblem is nonconvex and includes bilinear terms. We propose three approaches to solve the bilinear formulation, including (1) linear relaxation via McCormick inequalities,(2) exact mixed-integer linear program reformulation via disjunctive inequalities, and (3) inner approximation method via a novel iterative procedure that exploits the structural properties of the bilinear optimization problem. We further carry out a comprehensive set of computational experiments with distributionally robust Mean-CVaR portfolios to compare the solution accuracy of the proposed algorithms, analyze the impact of the radius of the Wasserstein ambiguity ball on the portfolio, and assess portfolio performance. We use a rolling-horizon approach to conduct the out-of-sample tests, which show the superior performance of the portfolios under marginal and copula ambiguity over the equally weighted and ambiguity-free Mean-CVaR benchmark portfolios.",
Identification of mutational signature for lung adenocarcinoma prognosis and immunotherapy prediction,"Sainan Zhang, Mengyue Li, Yilong Tan, Juxuan Zhang, Yixin Liu, Wenbin Jiang, Xin Li, Haitao Qi, Lefan Tang, Ran Ji, Wenyuan Zhao, Yunyan Gu, Lishuang Qi",2022/12,Journal Journal of Molecular Medicine,"There is no robust genomic signature to predict the prognosis of patients with early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). It was known that clonal heterogeneity was closely associated to tumour progression and prognosis prediction. Herein, using stage I patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified the clonal/subclonal events of each gene and preselected a set of genes with prognosis-specific mutation patterns based on a robust published transcriptomic prognostic signature. Subsequently, we constructed a mutational prognostic signature (MPS), whose prognostic performance was independently validated in two datasets of stage I samples. The predicted high-risk patients had significantly higher immune cell infiltration, along with higher expression of cytotoxic and immune checkpoint genes, and an integrated dataset with 88 samples confirmed that high-risk patients could benefit from immunotherapy …",

Managing Supply Risk in Fixed Price Contracts: A Contingent Claims Perspective,"Bardia Kamrad, Ran Ji, Glen M Schmidt",2017/12/20,"Journal Foundations and Trends® in Technology, Information and Operations Management","The primary focus of this paper is supply risk mitigation. though, its objectives are twofold. First, we develop a generic contingent claims model framed as an exercise in stochastic optimal control. The model is easily adjusted to a number of risk-based operational problems. Second, we adapt the model to the problem of supply uncertainty and the valuation of a fixed price contract with a focus on managing supply uncertainty through a portfolio based risk sharing framework. The risk and reward tradeoffs characterizing our general findings in this chapter indicate a subtle balance between supply risk, sourcing allocations and related costs, and accordingly, the resulting operational strategies considered. Given this setup, increased supplier-portfolio risk is a defining measure in establishing optimal operating policies, with the caveat that increases in the supplier portfolio’s volatility, also increase shortages which lowers the contract’s value.",
Models and Algorithms for Portfolio Optimization Under Uncertainty,Ran Ji,2016,Institution The George Washington University,"This dissertation consists of four papers addressing different aspects of financial portfolio optimization problems. The first paper studies an extended set of Mean-Gini models and explores the properties of the reward-to-variability Mean-Gini Ratio performance measure. Compared to other mean-risk models, the performances of Gini-based models are evaluated via an empirical cross-validation test based on different market trend patterns. The second paper develops an interactive solution procedure to help an investor with implicit utility function search for the optimal portfolio among the efficient portfolios through a reasonable number of pari-wise comparisons. The effectiveness of the proposed interactive procedure and performance of optimal portfolios corresponding to a range of utility functions are assessed via computational tests.
