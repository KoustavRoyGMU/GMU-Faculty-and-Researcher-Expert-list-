This paper presents a measurement-driven study of possible privacy leakage from BLE communication between the fitness tracker and the smartphone. Using real BLE traffic traces collected in the wild and in controlled experiments, we show that majority of the fitness trackers use unchanged BLE address while advertising, making it feasible to track them. The BLE traffic of the fitness trackers is found to be correlated with the intensity of user's activity, making it possible for an eavesdropper to determine user's current activity (walking, sitting, idle or running) through BLE traffic analysis. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the BLE traffic can represent user's gait which is known to be …",152

Your ap knows how you move: fine-grained device motion recognition through wifi,"Yunze Zeng, Parth H Pathak, Chao Xu, Prasant Mohapatra",2014/9/11,Book Proceedings of the 1st ACM workshop on Hot topics in wireless,"Recent WiFi standards use Channel State Information (CSI) feedback for better MIMO and rate adaptation. CSI provides detailed information about current channel conditions for different subcarriers and spatial streams. In this paper, we show that CSI feedback from a client to the AP can be used to recognize different fine-grained motions of the client. We find that CSI can not only identify if the client is in motion or not, but also classify different types of motions. To this end, we propose APsense, a framework that uses CSI to estimate the sensor patterns of the client. It is observed that client's sensor (e.g. accelerometer) values are correlated to CSI values available at the AP. We show that using simple machine learning classifiers, APsense can classify different motions with accuracy as high as 90%.",61

Contextual Localization Through Network Traffic Analysis,"Aveek K Das, Parth H Pathak, Chen-Nee Chuah, Prasant Mohapatra",2014,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2014,"The rise of location-based services has enabled many opportunities for content service providers to optimize the content delivery based on user's location. Since sharing precise location remains a major privacy concern among the users, many location-based services rely on contextual location (e.g. residence, cafe etc.) as opposed to acquiring user's exact physical location. In this paper, we present PACL (Privacy-Aware Contextual Localizer), which can learn user's contextual location just by passively monitoring user's network traffic. PACL can discern a set of vital attributes (statistical and application-based) from user's network traffic, and predict user's contextual location with a very high accuracy.

However, the benefits of these technologies are not readily accessible to Deaf or Hard-ofHearing (DHH) users. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a sign recognition system using multiple modalities that can be used by DHH signers to interact with voice-controlled devices. With the advancement of depth sensors, skeletal data is used for applications like video analysis and activity recognition. Despite having similarity with the well-studied human activity recognition, the use of 3D skeleton data in sign language recognition is rare. This is because unlike activity recognition, sign language is mostly dependent on hand shape pattern. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using skeletal and RGB video data for sign language recognition using a combination of different deep learning architectures. We validate our results on a large-scale American Sign Language (ASL) dataset of 12 users and 13107 samples across 51 signs. It is named as GMUASL51.

In this article we elaborate on a newer kind of threat referred to as an insider attack in which cognitive users themselves misbehave in order to gain unauthorized or unfair access to spectrum resources. We show that insider attacks are comparatively easier to carry out in both licensed and unlicensed cognitive operations, and they can severely damage the expected system performance. We discuss how these threats can be mitigated, and outline the specific challenges that need to be addressed when designing a detection and mitigation strategy.",22
Hand pose guided 3d pooling for word-level sign language recognition,"Al Amin Hosain, Panneer Selvam Santhalingam, Parth Pathak, Huzefa Rangwala, Jana Kosecka",2021,Conference Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision,"Gestures in American Sign Language (ASL) are characterized by fast, highly articulate motion of upper body, including arm movements with complex hand shapes and facial expressions. In this work, we propose a new method for word-level sign recognition from American Sign Language (ASL) using video. Our method uses both motion and hand shape cues while being robust to variations of execution. We exploit the knowledge of the body pose, estimated from an off-the-shelf pose estimator. Using the pose as a guide, we pool spatio-temporal feature maps from different layers of a 3D convolutional neural network. We train separate classifiers using pose guided pooled features from different resolutions and fuse their prediction scores during test time. This leads to a significant improvement in performance on the WLASL benchmark dataset [25]. The proposed approach achieves 10%, 12%, 9: 5% and 6: 5% performance gain on WLASL100, WLASL300, WLASL1000, WLASL2000 subsets respectively. To demonstrate the robustness of the pose guided pooling and proposed fusion mechanism, we also evaluate our method by fine tuning the model on another dataset. This yields 10% performance improvement for the proposed method using only 0: 4% training data during fine tuning stage.",21

Centrality-based power control for hot-spot mitigation in multi-hop wireless networks,"Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta",2012/5/15,Journal Computer Communications,"When shortest path routing is employed in large scale multi-hop wireless networks such as sensor networks, nodes located near the center of the network have to perform disproportionate amount of relaying for others. Nodes in such traffic hot-spots deplete their batteries faster than others due to their high relay load. These traffic hot-spots also adversely affect the network capacity due to increased congestion in the regions. To solve the problem, various divergent routing schemes are used which route the data on center-avoiding divergent routing paths. Though they achieve better load balancing, overall relaying is increased significantly due to their longer routing paths. In this paper, we propose power control as a way for balancing relay load and mitigating hot-spots in wireless sensor networks. Using a heuristic based on the concept of centrality, we show that if we increase the power levels of only the nodes …",19

On Availability-Performability Trade-off in Wireless Mesh Networks,"Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta, Prasant Mohapatra",2014,Journal IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,"It is understood from past decade of research that a wireless multi-hop network can achieve maximum network throughput only when its nodes operate at a minimum common transmission power level that ensures network connectivity (availability).

At the heart of OmniScatter is the new High Definition FMCW (HD-FMCW), which interplays with the tag (FSK) signal to disentangle the ambient reflections from the tag signal in the frequency domain, essentially offering …",
Assessing Lower Extremity Kinematics of Roofing Tasks,"Matin Jahani Jirsaraei, Behzad Esmaeili, Parth Pathak",2022/3,Book Construction Research Congress 2022,"Roofers spend considerable time in awkward postures due to steep-slope rooftops. The combination of these postures, the forces acting on them, and the time spent in such postures increases the chance of roofers developing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Several studies have connected these awkward postures to potential risk factors for injuries and disorders; however, existing models are not appropriate in roof workplaces because they are designed to assess work-related risk factors for general tasks. This study examines the impacts of work-related factors, namely working posture and roof slope, on kinematics measurements of body segments in a laboratory setting. To achieve this objective, time-stamped motion data from inertial measurement unit (IMU) devices (i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope, and quaternion signals) were collected from a sample of six undergraduate students at George Mason …",
American Sign Language Recognition Using an FMCW Wireless Sensor (Student Abstract),"Yuanqi Du, Nguyen Dang, Riley Wilkerson, Parth Pathak, Huzefa Rangwala, Jana Kosecka",2020/4/3,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"In today's digital world, rapid technological advancements continue to lessen the burden of tasks for individuals. Among these tasks is communication across perceived language barriers. Indeed, increased attention has been drawn to American Sign Language (ASL) recognition in recent years. Camera-based and motion detection-based methods have been researched extensively; however, there remains a divide in communication between ASL users and non-users. Therefore, this research team proposes the use of a novel wireless sensor (Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave Radar) to help bridge the gap in communication. In short, this device sends out signals that detect the user's body positioning in space. These signals then reflect off the body and back to the sensor, developing thousands of cloud points per second, indicating where the body is positioned in space. These cloud points can then be examined for movement over multiple consecutive time frames using a cell division algorithm, ultimately showing how the body moves through space as it completes a single gesture or sentence. At the end of the project, 95% accuracy was achieved in one-object prediction as well as 80% accuracy on cross-object prediction with 30% other objects' data introduced on 19 commonly used gestures. There are 30 samples for each gesture per person from three persons.",

Joint Design,"Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta, Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta",2013,Journal Designing for Network and Service Continuity in Wireless Mesh Networks,"Having described individual problems of design in mesh networks in an earlier chapter, we now describe design problems that more recent literature has focused on, which address the problem of jointly designing more than one functional or operational aspect of the network, such as joint routing and power control. As before, we survey solution approaches proposed in literature as well as describing the problems. We first organize our discussion by explicit combinations of functions, but later we include discussions on designing for sustainability in energy, back-pressure related design, and cognitive mesh design, since these design areas (while having their distinct identities) can all be seen as joint or multifunction design as we have described here.",
Survivability of Mesh Networks,"Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta, Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta",2013,Journal Designing for Network and Service Continuity in Wireless Mesh Networks,"The general concept of fault tolerance can be quantified in various different metrics, reflecting different needs, concerns and perceived risks. We start with a short primer on the general concept of survivability, and introduce some of these metrics. We argue that availability and performability are useful metrics to reflect the goal of service continuity for the emerging uses of the mesh paradigm. After discussing the issue of component failures and topological resilience, we discuss the problems of availability and performability, and discuss approaches in the literature. The literature in this area is still evolving, and we identify useful open research problems in performability oriented design of mesh networks.",
Mesh Enabling Technology,"Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta, Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta",2013,Journal Designing for Network and Service Continuity in Wireless Mesh Networks,"While the mesh network paradigm does not constrain the physical and medium layer realizations, some technologies emerge over time as clearly being better suited. This becomes especially true when considering service continuity issues, and therefore robustness of enabling technologies. In recent times, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology at the lower layer is seen to hold promise to improve the predictability and dependability of mesh networks. At a higher level, various cellular approaches, including various 802.16 and 3GPP standards, as well as the newly emerging cognitive or “white space” networking approaches, are providing extensions to multi-hopping, and becoming more relevant than the 802.11 technology which was earliest put to work on WMNs. In this chapter, we briefly describe the relevant aspects of these, including references to some relevant literature. We start with a few …",
Mesh Design: Network Issues,"Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta, Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta",2013,Journal Designing for Network and Service Continuity in Wireless Mesh Networks,"We continue our discussion of traditional design problems in mesh networks, preparatory to the discussion of joint design in a following chapter. In this chapter, we focus on network-wide issues in mesh design, or issues that in some sense emerge at the network level. In particular, we focus on routing, deployment planning, performance modeling, rate control, and spectrum sensing and access. As before, we describe the problems, as well as discuss some representative approaches in recent literature. ",
Mesh Design: Lower Layer Issues,"Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta, Parth H Pathak, Rudra Dutta",2013,Journal Designing for Network and Service Continuity in Wireless Mesh Networks,"To enable the discussion of joint design in a following chapter, we introduce and discuss the more traditional design problems in this chapter. We focus on organizing our discussion by the fundamental problems and operations in the network. In particular, in this chapter, we focus on issues closer to the physical medium, such as the modeling of interference, power and topology control, scheduling, channel and radio assignment. Together with describing each problem, we describe approaches that have been advanced in the literature, concentrating for this purpose on more recent literature.",
