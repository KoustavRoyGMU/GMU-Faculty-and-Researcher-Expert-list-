Seven aspects of mixed-initiative reasoning: An introduction to this special issue on mixed-initiative assistants,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu, Michael T Cox",2007/6/15,Journal AI Magazine,"Mixed-initiative assistants are agents that interact seamlessly with humans to extend their problem-solving capabilities or provide new capabilities. Developing such agents requires the synergistic integration of many areas of AI, including knowledge representation, problem solving and planning, knowledge acquisition and learning, multiagent systems, discourse theory, and human-computer interaction. This paper introduces seven aspects of mixed-initiative reasoning (task, control, awareness, communication, personalization, architecture, and evaluation) and discusses them in the context of several state-of-the-art mixed-initiative assistants. The goal is to provide a framework for understanding and comparing existing mixed-initiative assistants and for developing general design principles and methods.",78
Knowledge engineering: building cognitive assistants for evidence-based reasoning,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Dorin Marcu, Mihai Boicu, David A Schum",2016/9/8,Publisher Cambridge University Press,"This book presents a significant advancement in the theory and practice of knowledge engineering, the discipline concerned with the development of intelligent agents that use knowledge and reasoning to perform problem solving and decision-making tasks. It covers the main stages in the development of a knowledge-based agent: understanding the application domain, modeling problem solving in that domain, developing the ontology, learning the reasoning rules, and testing the agent. The book focuses on a special class of agents: cognitive assistants for evidence-based reasoning that learn complex problem-solving expertise directly from human experts, support experts, and nonexperts in problem solving and decision making, and teach their problem-solving expertise to students. A powerful learning agent shell, Disciple-EBR, is included with the book, enabling students, practitioners, and researchers to develop cognitive assistants rapidly in a wide variety of domains that require evidence-based reasoning, including intelligence analysis, cybersecurity, law, forensics, medicine, and education.",45

An Integrated Shell and Methodology for Rapid Development of Knowledge-Based Agents.,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu, Kathryn Wright, Seok Won Lee, Dorin Marcu, Michael Bowman",1999/7/18,Conference AAAI/IAAI,"This paper introduces the concept of learning agent shell as a new class of tools for rapid development of practical endto-end knowledge-based agents, by domain experts, with limited assistance from knowledge engineers. A learning agent shell consists of a learning and knowledge acquisition engine as well as an inference engine and supports building an agent with a knowledge base consisting of an ontology and a set of problem solving rules. The paper describes a specific learning agent shell and its associated agent building methodology. The process of developing an agent relies on importing ontologies from existing repositories of knowledge, and on teaching the agent how to perform various tasks, in a way that resembles how an expert would teach a human apprentice when solving problems in cooperation. The shell and methodology represent a practical integration of knowledge representation, knowledge acquisition, learning and problem solving.

"Intelligence analysis as discovery of evidence, hypotheses, and arguments: Connecting the dots","Gheorghe Tecuci, David A Schum, Dorin Marcu, Mihai Boicu",2016/8/30,Publisher Cambridge University Press,"This unique book on intelligence analysis covers several vital but often overlooked topics. It teaches the evidential and inferential issues involved in'connecting the dots' to draw defensible and persuasive conclusions from masses of evidence: from observations we make, or questions we ask, we generate alternative hypotheses as explanations or answers; we make use of our hypotheses to generate new lines of inquiry and discover new evidence; and we test the hypotheses with the discovered evidence. To facilitate understanding of these issues and enable the performance of complex analyses, the book introduces an intelligent analytical tool, called Disciple-CD. Readers will practice with Disciple-CD and learn how to formulate hypotheses; develop arguments that reduce complex hypotheses to simpler ones; collect evidence to evaluate the simplest hypotheses; and assess the relevance and the believability of evidence, which combine in complex ways to determine its inferential force and the probabilities of the hypotheses.",43

Disciple-COA can collaborate with the expert to develop its knowledge base consisting of a frame-based ontology that defines the terms from the application domain, and a set of plausible version space rules expressed with these terms. Its central component is a plausible reasoner that can distinguish between four types of problem solving situations: routine, innovative, inventive and creative. This ability guides the interactions with the expert during which the agent learns general rules from specific examples, by integrating a wide range of knowledge acquisition and machine learning strategies, including apprenticeship learning, empirical inductive learning from examples and explanations, and analogical learning. Disciple-COA was developed in the DARPA's High Performance Knowledge Bases program to solve the challenge problem of critiquing military courses of action that were developed as hasty candidate plans for ground combat operations. We present the course of action challenge problem, the process of teaching Disciple-COA to solve it, and the results of DARPA’s evaluation in which Disciple-COA demonstrated the best knowledge acquisition rate and problem solving performance.

Some are human assets or informants; others are sensing devices of various kinds. Of great concern is the extent to which the events revealed in these evidence items can be believed. That the information received has been deliberately contrived to mislead is always possible. An informant may have any number of reasons for fabricating deceptive evidence. Also possible is that our human sources or sensing devices are simply erroneous. Whether by deliberate fabrications or observational mistakes, being misled in the conclusions drawn from intelligence evidence is always possible. Unfortunately, another way intelligence analysts can be easily misled concerns what is done with the information between the time the original",22

Introduction to Intelligence Analysis: A Hands-on Approach with TIACRITIS,"Gheorghe Tecuci, DA Schum, Mihai Boicu, Dorin Marcu",2010,Volume 220,"One of our most important protections against terrorists and other enemies is the imaginative and critical reasoning abilities of our intelligence analysts who face the highly complex task of drawing defensible and persuasive conclusions from masses of evidence of all kinds from a variety of different sources (eg Schum, 1987). These conclusions are necessarily probabilistic in nature because our evidence is always incomplete (we can look for more, if we have time), usually inconclusive (it is consistent with the truth of more than one hypothesis or possible explanation), frequently ambiguous (we cannot always determine exactly what the evidence is telling us), commonly dissonant (some of it favors one hypothesis or possible explanation but other evidence favors other hypotheses), and with various degrees of believability (Schum, 2001). Arguments, often stunningly complex, requiring both imaginative and critical reasoning, are necessary in order to establish and defend the three major credentials of evidence: its relevance, believability, and inferential force or weight.",8

The knowledge base of the agent is structured into an object ontology that contains a hierarchical description of the objects and features from an application domain, and a set of task reduction rules expressed with these objects. The Disciple approach has already been applied to develop knowledge-based agents for complex military tasks such as course of action critiquing and center of gravity analysis (Tecuci et al. 2002).

Military Applications of the Disciple Learning Agent,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu",2002,Journal Advanced Information Systems in Defense and Related Applications,"This chapter presents an overview of the Disciple approach and its military applications. Disciple is a theory, methodology, and family of agent shells for the development of intelligent agents by subject matter experts, with limited assistance from computer scientists or knowledge engineers [1]. A subject matter expert interacts directly with a Disciple agent, to teach it to solve problems, in a way that is similar to how the expert would teach a human apprentice, by giving the agent examples and explanations, as well as by supervising and correcting its behavior. The agent learns from the expert by generalizing the examples and the explanations to build its knowledge base. The Disciple approach integrates methods for mixed-initiative problem solving, teaching, and multistrategy learning, exploiting the complementariness between human and automated reasoning, and creating a synergism between the expert that has the knowledge to be formalized and the agent that knows how to formalize it. In the last few years the development of the Disciple approach has been a direct result of its application to three military challenge problems used in the DARPA’s “High Performance Knowledge Bases” and “Rapid Knowledge Formation” programs [2, 3]:",7

Toward a computational theory of evidence-based reasoning,"Gheorghe Tecuci, David Schum, Mihai Boicu, Dorin Marcu, Katherine Russell",2011/5/24,Journal Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Control Systems and Computer Science,"Evidence-based reasoning is at the core of many problem solving and decision making tasks in a wide variety of domains. Through abductive reasoning we generate hypotheses from our observations; through deductive reasoning we use our hypotheses to generate new lines of inquiry and discover new evidence; and through inductive reasoning we test our hypotheses with this discovered evidence. These processes, which integrate imaginative and critical reasoning, are often stunningly complex because our evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, ambiguous, dissonant, and has various degrees of believability. We present research performed in the Learning Agents Center of George Mason University on developing a Computational Theory of Evidence-based Reasoning viewed as mixed-initiative integration of evidence in search of hypotheses, hypotheses in search of evidence, and evidential tests of hypotheses, all taking place simultaneously, in a world that is changing all the time. This theory is embedded in the Disciple cognitive agents which are capable of capturing tacit knowledge from subject matter experts, and can act as assistants to experts, as expert consultants to non-experts, or as intelligent tutors to students. We illustrate the applications of these agents in various domains, including intelligence analysis and inquiry-based learning in natural sciences.",5

A methodology for modeling and representing expert knowledge that supports teaching-based intelligent agent development,"Michael Bowman, Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu",2000/7/30,Conference AAAI/IAAI,"The long term research goal of our research group is to change the way a knowledge-based agent is built, from being programmed by a knowledge engineer (based on what he or she has learned from a domain expert) to being directly taught by a domain expert that receives limited or no support from a knowledge engineer. The investigated approach, called Disciple (Tecuci, 1998), relies on developing a very capable learning and reasoning agent that can collaborate with a domain expert to develop its knowledge base consisting of an ontology that defines the terms from the application domain, and a set of general task reduction rules expressed with these terms. An important component of this research is the development of a general methodology for modeling and representing expert knowledge that supports teachingbased intelligent agent development. With respect to this methodology we formulate the following claims: 1) it is natural for the expert, 2) it is applicable to a wide variety of domains; 3) it identifies the tasks to be represented in the agent’s knowledge base, 4) it identifies the necessary concepts and features to be represented in the ontology, 5) it guides the rule learning process 6) it supports natural language generation of solutions by the agent and their abstract justifications.",5

The investigated solution consists of developing a very capable learning agent shell that can perform many of the functions of a knowledge engineer. As an expert system shell, the learning agent shell includes a general problem solving engine that can be reused for multiple applications. In addition, it includes a multistrategy learning engine for building its knowledge base (KB) which has two main components: an object ontology that defines the concepts from a specific application domain, and a set of task reduction rules expressed with these concepts. The subject matter expert and the agent engage into a mixed-initiative reasoning process during which the expert is teaching the agent his problem solving expertise, and the agent learns from the expert, building, verifying, and improving its KB. Over the years we have developed a series of increasingly more capable learning agent shells from the Disciple family. The most recent family member, Disciple-RKF/COG, represents a significant advancement over its predecessors. It implements a more powerful plausible version space representation that allows all the types of knowledge from the KB (not only the rules, but also the objects and the tasks) to be learned with similar methods.

One possible solution to this problem is provided by the mixed-initiative Disciple approach where an expert teaches a learning agent while solving problems in cooperation. Disciple synergistically integrates the complementary human and automated reasoning to take advantage of their respective knowledge, reasoning styles and computational strengths. The general strategy behind the Disciple approach is to replace the difficult knowledge engineering tasks required to build a knowledge base, tasks that cannot be performed by a subject matter expert, with simpler tasks that can be performed by the expert. The teaching process is illustrated with examples involving the Disciple workaround agent that is able to plan how a convoy of military vehicles can work around obstacles in their path.",4

This approach relies on a Disciple learning agent that can be trained to solve problems by an expert. First, however, a knowledge engineer has to work with the expert to define the object ontology of Disciple. This ontology consists of hierarchical descriptions of objects and features from the application domain. Then, the expert can teach Disciple to solve problems in a way that resembles how the expert would teach a student. For instance, the expert defines a specific problem, helps the agent to understand each reasoning step toward the solution, and supervises and corrects the agent‘s behavior, when it attempts to solve new problems. During such mixed-initiative interactions, the agent learns general problem solving rules from individual problem solving steps and their explanations of success or failure. A critical role in this multistrategy rule learning process is played by the object ontology, which is used as the generalization hierarchy.",3

"Mixed-Initiative Reasoning for Integrated Domain Modeling, Learning and Problem Solving","Mihai Boicu, Gheorghe Tecuci",2000,Journal PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"The main challenge addressed by this research is the knowledge acquisition bottleneck defined as the difficulty of creating and maintaining a knowledge base that represents a model of the exp ertise domain that exists in the mind of a domain expert. The mixed-initiative approach we are investigating, called Disciple (Tecuci et al. 1999; Boicu et al., 2000), relies on developing a very capable agent that can collaborate with the domain expert to develop its knowledge base. In this approach both the agent and the expert are accorded responsibility for those elements of knowledge engineering for which they have the most aptitude, and together they form a complete team for knowledge base development. The domain modeling and problem solving approach is based on task reduction paradigm. The knowledge base to be developed consisting of an OKBC-type ontology that defines the terms from the application domain, and a set of plausible task reduction rules expressed with these terms. The main focus of our research is the development of a powerful and flexible mixed-initiative plausible reasoner that allows the expert to train the agent in a variety of ways, and in as natural a manner as possible, similar to the way the expert would train a human apprentice. This reasoner exploits the structure of the ontology and of the plausible task reduction rules to integrate the domain modeling, learning and problem solving processes involved in developing the knowledge base of the agent. The goal is to develop a knowledge base that will allow the agent to exhibit a problem solving competence that is similar with that of the domain expert. We call the set of …",1
Using Machine Learning to Predict University Student Failure Based on Recurring Assignment Procrastination,"Jay Lalwani, Aditya Daga, Mihai Boicu",2022/12/13,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Researchers have long considered procrastination as a form of self-destructive behavior and a key factor in university students’ failure (Steel, 2007). In order to predict student failure and allow early warning, we developed and trained a neural network based on second-week activities that allow multiple attempts in a college course at George Mason University. The following procrastination-related inputs were computed: average time spent between a student’s first and last attempt through all assignments, average time remaining before each assignment deadline from the last attempt, average assignment grade, and the average number of assignment attempts.

With the technological advancement into education, it gives a good chance to revisit assignment policies. It has become very easy for teachers to accept multiple attempts for assignments due to the nature of online submissions. However, it is also important to consider the impacts this may have on a student's learning. It could be claimed that students may express less motivation to complete assignments correctly the first time. It could also be claimed that students can take the opportunity of additional submissions to learn better from their mistakes. Previous research has suggested some combination of both.

Using BERT Extraction Combined with Transformer-Based Question Generation on CNN Stories,"ERIC LI, Mihai Boicu",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"One recurring challenge to computer question generation (QG) throughout the years is the ability to handle large amounts of context. The majority of models often train using SQuAD or similar datasets, which contain short text inputs with very little context, and hence have difficulty with larger inputs. Here, we propose a new model that combines extractive text summarization with transformer-based question generation. Context is first condensed using a BERT model and then fed through a simple, single pre-trained language model that generates the questions. The model was used on 100 CNN news articles taken from the NewsQA dataset, which are longer and contain much more context in comparison to SQuAD. The model generated around an average of 4 questions per article that were manually evaluated. We determined that around half focused on the main topic of the story while the others focused on other …",
Automated Short Answer Grading Using Bi-LSTM and Manhattan Distance,"AKHIL MARAPAKA, SHIRLEY BENEDICT, Mihai Boicu Boicu",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Free-response questions are commonly used by teachers, professors, and other academic professionals to evaluate student learning on assessments. Short-answer questions especially can be highly versatile and efficient because of their open-ended nature, but can also be time-consuming to grade and provide feedback for this same reason. In existing research on short-answer question grading, machine learning systems have been developed to automate the grading process for a limited domain of questions. In this paper, we present a Bi-LSTM model that can grade any type of short-answer question, defined as an answer that is between 1-2 sentences long, regardless of the subject matter. The Bi-LSTM assigns each important word in the model, as well as each student’s answer, a vector.

Then, the confirmed data will be recorded in the gradebook. We tested that the proposed process is faster and easier than manual input. To train the OCR with numeric data and name data, we used the machine learning library Scikit-learn with selected datasets. We achieved 86% accuracy with reading double digits and 62% accuracy with reading names.

A Generalization of Compositional Matrix-Space Models of Language for Short Answer Scoring,"STEPHEN HUAN, DHRUV SUNDARARAMAN, SHAWN MALIK, Mihai Boicu",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) consists of using computer programs to grade student short responses to free response questions. Current state of the art algorithms for ASAG rely on statistical representations of words, commonly generated through deep learning techniques like word2vec. One property of word2vec is commutativity, ie switching the order of words does not change the embedding. Motivated by this shortcoming, word2mat embeds words as matrices, whose multiplication is noncommutative. However, word2mat is both linear and associative, while English has nonlinear effects in certain contexts. To address these mathematical properties, we propose representing words as shallow neural networks. We then generalize word2mat by introducing a simple nonlinear activation function between each matrix multiplication, which we show makes the embedding noncommutative, nonlinear, and …",

Rapid Prototyping of a Cognitive System for Pediatric Telephone Triage Tutoring,Mihai Boicu,2011,Book Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures 2011,"This paper presents the development of a prototype cognitive system for tutoring pediatric telephone triage to resident doctors. The cognitive system is built through a spiral development methodology by using the Disciple learning agent shell. This illustrates solutions to challenges encountered in developing cognitive systems in new domains with a low budget, including prioritizing the development, reuse of general purpose modules, and experimentation-driven development.",
TEACHING INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS WITH TIACRITIS,"M Boicu, D Marcu",2010/12,Journal American Intelligence Journal,"This paper 1) discusses the astonishing complexity of intelligence analysis by using the popular etaphor of oe ti g the dots, outli es as ste ati o putatio al approach, grounded in the Science of Evidence, that allows coping with this complexity, and 3) introduces an innovative intelligent software agent, called TIACRITIS, for teaching intelligence analysts how to perform evidence-based reasoning. TIACRITIS is a web-based system with case studies and knowledge bases incorporating a significant amount of knowledge about evidence, its properties, uses, and discovery. It is a personalizable agent that helps analysts acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities involved in discovering and processing of evidence and in drawing defensible and persuasive conclusions from it, by employing an effective learning-by-doing approach. It allows analysts to practice and learn how to link evidence to hypotheses through abductive, deductive, and inductive reasoning that establish the basic credentials of evidence: its relevance, believability, and inferential force or weight. Analysts can also experiment with what-if scenarios and study the influence of various assumptions on the final result of analysis.",
Agent Learning for Mixed-Initiative Knowledge Acquisition,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu",2010/2/28,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA,"This research has advanced the Disciple learning and problem solving theory for rapid development and maintenance of adaptable cognitive assistants in uncertain and dynamic environments. These assistants can capture, use, preserve, and transfer to other users the subject matter expertise which currently takes years to establish, is lost when experts separate from service, and is costly to replace. The research has developed an integrated set of methods for representing partially learned knowledge, for knowledge acquisition through teaching and learning, for evidence-based reasoning with Wigmorean inference networks integrating logic and probabilities, and for mixed-initiative interaction. These methods have been implemented into a general agent shell that incorporates a large amount of knowledge for evidence-based reasoning from the Science of Evidence. The agent shell can be taught to solve problems by a subject matter expert, with assistance from a knowledge engineer, to become a domain-specific cognitive assistant. The shell has been used to develop several prototype cognitive assistants. For instance, the cognitive assistant for intelligence analysis demonstrated mixed-initiative learning of complex analysis rules and mixed-initiative hypothesis analysis, allowing the analyst to drill-down based on available time and evidence, to make probabilistic assumptions, and to revise the analysis in light of new evidence.",
"Disciple Cognitive Agents: Learning, Problem Solving Assistance, and Tutoring","Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu, Dorin Marcu, David Schum",2010,Book Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures 2010,"Over the years we have researched a computational theory and technology that allows regular computer users who are not knowledge engineers to develop intelligent agents that incorporate their problem solving expertise [1–7]. This resulted in a series of increasingly more powerful Disciple cognitive agents that integrate several complementary capabilities. They are able to learn, directly from their users, their subject matter expertise, which currently takes years to establish, is lost when experts separate from service, and is costly to replace. They can assist their users in solving complex problems in uncertain and dynamic environments, and they can tutor students in expert problem solving. Disciple agents have been developed for a wide variety of domains, including manufacturing [1], education [2], course of action critiquing [3], center of gravity determination [4, 5], and intelligence analysis [6].

Learning Best Concept Approximations from Examples,"Mihai Boicu, Gheorghe Tecuci",2005,Journal International Journal of Computational Intelligence Research,"This paper addresses the problem of learning the best approximation of a concept from examples, when the concept cannot be expressed in the learner’s representation language. It presents a method that determines the version space of the best approximations and demonstrates that for any given approximation of the target concept there is a better approximation in this version space. The method does not depend on the order of examples and has an almost monotonic convergence. This method was developed for the Disciple learning agent that can be taught by a subject matter expert how to perform complex problem solving tasks.",
Information Age Warfare-Intelligent Agents in the Classroom and the Strategic Analysis Center,"Michael Bowman, Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu, Jerome Comello",2004/12/1,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA,"This paper presents a unique research and development project conducted over the past four years by the George Mason University GMU Learning Agents Center LAC and the US Army War College. This research synergistically integrates cutting edge artificial intelligence research, military strategy research, and the practical use of agents in strategic analysis and education in the context of Information Age Warfare and Network-Centric Operations. This research has produced a collaborative assistant for rapid knowledge formation RKF and reasoning, called Disciple-RKF. Disciple-RKF enables a team of subject matter experts who do not have prior knowledge engineering experience to rapidly build and use intelligent knowledge-based agents, with limited assistance from a knowledge engineer. Each subject matter expert teaches a personal Disciple-RKF agent while collaborating with it in solving specific problems. During this process, each Disciple-RKF agent learns from its expert and builds its knowledge base. These knowledge bases are then merged into an integrated knowledge base for Disciple-RKF. Disciple-RKF has been successfully applied to develop knowledge-based agents for military center of gravity analysis which have been used in the curriculum of the US Army War College.",
A Methodology for Modeling and Representing Expert Knowledge that Supports Teaching-Based Intelligent Agent...,"Michael Bowman, Gheorghe Tecuci, Mihai Boicu","The long term research goal of our research group is to change the way a knowledge-based agent is built, from being programmed by a knowledge engineer (based on what he or she has learned from a domain expert) to being directly taught by a domain expert that receives limited or no support from a knowledge engineer. The investigated approach, called Disciple (Tecuci, 1998), relies on developing a very capable learning and reasoning agent that can collaborate with a domain expert to develop its knowledge base consisting of an ontology that defines the terms from the application domain, and a set of general task reduction rules expressed with these terms. An important component of this research is the development of a general methodology for modeling and representing expert knowledge that supports teachingbased intelligent agent development. With respect to this methodology we formulate the following claims: 1) it is natural for the expert, 2) it is applicable to a wide variety of domains; 3) it identifies the tasks to be represented in the agent’s knowledge base, 4) it identifies the necessary concepts and features to be represented in the ontology, 5) it guides the rule learning process 6) it supports natural language generation of solutions by the agent and their abstract justifications.We will briefly illustrate this methodology with the Course Of Action (COA) challenge problem that consists of rapidly developing a knowledge-based critiquer that receives as input the description of a military course of action and assesses various aspects of the COA, such as its strengths and weaknesses with respect to the Principles of War and the Tenets of …","Scholar articles A Methodology for Modeling and Representing Expert Knowledge that Supports Teaching-Based Intelligent Agent...M Bowman, G Tecuci, M BoicuRelated articles ","The long term research goal of our research group is to change the way a knowledge-based agent is built, from being programmed by a knowledge engineer (based on what he or she has learned from a domain expert) to being directly taught by a domain expert that receives limited or no support from a knowledge engineer.

Intelligence Analysis:“Connecting the Dots”,"Gheorghe Tecuci, David A Schum, Dorin Marcu, Mihai Boicu","We have included a frequently used metaphor in our book’s title:“Connecting the Dots.” This metaphor seems appropriate in characterizing the evidential and inferential matters discussed in this book. The metaphor may have gained its current popularity following the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, DC, on September 11, 2001. It was frequently said that the intelligence services did not connect the dots appropriately in order to have possibly prevented the catastrophes that occurred. Since then, we have seen and heard this metaphor applied in the news media to inferences in a very wide array of contexts, in addition to intelligence, including legal, military, and business contexts. For example, we have seen it applied to allegedly faulty medical diagnoses; to allegedly faulty conclusions in historical studies; to allegedly faulty or unpopular governmental decisions; and in discussions involving the conclusions reached by competing politicians. What is also true is that the commentators on television and radio, or the sources of written accounts of inferential failures, never tell us what they mean by the phrase “connecting the dots.” A natural explanation is that they have never even considered what this phrase means and what it might involve.But we have made a detailed study of what “connecting the dots” entails. We have found this metaphor very useful, and quite intuitive, in illustrating the extraordinary complexity of the evidential and inferential reasoning required in the contexts we have mentioned. Listening or seeing some media accounts of this process may lead one to believe that it resembles the simple tasks we performed as …","Scholar articles Intelligence Analysis:“Connecting the Dots”G Tecuci, DA Schum, D Marcu, M Boicu","We have included a frequently used metaphor in our book’s title:“Connecting the Dots.” This metaphor seems appropriate in characterizing the evidential and inferential matters discussed in this book.

Excerpt,"Gheorghe Tecuci, Dorin Marcu, Mihai Boicu, David A Schum","We can try to understand the world in various ways, an obvious one being the employment of empirical methods for gathering and analyzing various forms of evidence about phenomena, events, and situations of interest to us. This will include work in all of the sciences, medicine, law, intelligence analysis, history, political affairs, current events, and a variety of other contexts too numerous to mention. In the sciences, this empirical work will involve both experimental and nonexperimental methods. In some of these contexts, notably in the sciences, we are able to devise mathematical and logical models that allow us to make inferences and predictions about complex matters of interest to us. But in every case, our understanding rests on our knowledge of the properties, uses, discovery, and marshaling of evidence. This is why we begin this book with a careful consideration of reasoning based on evidence.","Scholar articles ExcerptG Tecuci, D Marcu, M Boicu, DA Schum","We can try to understand the world in various ways, an obvious one being the employment of empirical methods for gathering and analyzing various forms of evidence about phenomena, events, and situations of interest to us.
