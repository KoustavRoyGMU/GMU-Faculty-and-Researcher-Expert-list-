Although these patterns have been hypothesized to contain important information about brain architecture, little is known about their origin or about their relationship to active cognitive processes such as conscious awareness and monitoring of the environment. In this study, we have investigated the amplitude and spatiotemporal characteristics of resting-state activity patterns and their dependence on the subjects' alertness. For this purpose, BOLD fMRI was performed at 3.0 T on 12 normal subjects using a visual stimulation protocol, followed by a 27 min rest period, during which subjects were allowed to fall asleep. In subjects who were asleep at the end of the scan, we found (a) a higher …",379

Monitoring glial activation in subjects with MS, therefore, has the potential to be informative with respect to disease activity. The translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is a promising biomarker of glial activation that can be imaged by positron emission tomography (PET). To characterize the in vivo TSPO expression in MS, we analyzed brain PET scans in subjects with MS and healthy volunteers in an observational study using [11C]PBR28, a newly developed translocator protein-specific radioligand. The [11C]PBR28 PET showed altered compartmental distribution of TSPO in the MS brain compared to healthy volunteers (p = 0.019).

Mapping resting-state functional connectivity using perfusion MRI,"Kai-Hsiang Chuang, Peter Van Gelderen, Hellmut Merkle, Jerzy Bodurka, Vasiliki N Ikonomidou, Alan P Koretsky, Jeff H Duyn, S Lalith Talagala",2008/5/1,Journal Neuroimage,"Resting-state, low-frequency (<0.08 Hz) fluctuations of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance signal have been shown to exhibit high correlation among functionally connected regions. However, correlations of cerebral blood flow (CBF) fluctuations during the resting state have not been extensively studied. The main challenges of using arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging to detect CBF fluctuations are low sensitivity, low temporal resolution, and contamination from BOLD. This work demonstrates CBF-based quantitative functional connectivity mapping by combining continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) with a neck labeling coil and a multi-channel receiver coil to achieve high perfusion sensitivity. In order to reduce BOLD contamination, the CBF signal was extracted from the CASL signal time course by high frequency filtering. This processing strategy is …",123
An adaptive filter for suppression of cardiac and respiratory noise in MRI time series data,"Roel HR Deckers, Peter van Gelderen, Mario Ries, Olivier Barret, Jeff H Duyn, Vasiliki N Ikonomidou, Masaki Fukunaga, Gary H Glover, Jacco A de Zwart",2006/12/1,Journal Neuroimage,"The quality of MRI time series data, which allows the study of dynamic processes, is often affected by confounding sources of signal fluctuation, including the cardiac and respiratory cycle.

Accelerated parallel imaging for functional imaging of the human brain,"Jacco A de Zwart, Peter van Gelderen, Xavier Golay, Vasiliki N Ikonomidou, Jeff H Duyn",2006/5,Source NMR in Biomedicine: An International Journal Devoted to the Development and Application of Magnetic Resonance In vivo,"Accelerated parallel imaging (PI) techniques have recently been applied to functional imaging experiments of the human brain in order to improve the performance of commonly used single‐shot techniques like echo‐planar imaging (EPI). Potential benefits of PI‐fMRI include the reduction of geometrical distortions due to off‐resonance signals, the reduction of signal‐loss in areas with substantial signal inhomogeneity, increases of the spatial and temporal resolution of the fMRI experiment and reduction of gradient acoustic noise. Although PI generally leads to a substantial decrease in image signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR), its effect on the temporal stability of the signal, which ultimately determines fMRI performance, is only partially determined by image SNR. Therefore, the penalty for using PI is generally not as severe as the SNR reduction. The majority of problems related to single‐shot techniques become more …",73

In patients with multiple sclerosis who display pathological alterations in iron and myelin contents, the use of R2* may offer a unique way to untangle mechanisms of disease. Coronal slices from 8 brains of deceased multiple sclerosis patients were imaged using a whole-body 7.0 Tesla MRI scanner. The scanning protocol included three-dimensional (3D) T2*-w multi-echo gradient-echo and 2D T2-w turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences. Histopathological analyses of myelin and iron content were done using Luxol fast blue and proteolipid myelin staining and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride enhanced Turnbull blue staining.

Generalized min-max bound-based MRI pulse sequence design framework for wide-range T1 relaxometry: A case study on the tissue specific imaging sequence,"Yang Liu, John R Buck, Vasiliki N Ikonomidou",2017/2/21,Journal PloS one,"This paper proposes a new design strategy for optimizing MRI pulse sequences for T1 relaxometry. The design strategy optimizes the pulse sequence parameters to minimize the maximum variance of unbiased T1 estimates over a range of T1 values using the Cramér-Rao bound. In contrast to prior sequences optimized for a single nominal T1 value, the optimized sequence using our bound-based strategy achieves improved precision and accuracy for a broad range of T1 estimates within a clinically feasible scan time. The optimization combines the downhill simplex method with a simulated annealing process. To show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we optimize the tissue specific imaging (TSI) sequence. Preliminary Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the optimized TSI sequence yields improved precision and accuracy over the popular driven-equilibrium single-pulse observation of T1 (DESPOT1) approach for normal brain tissues (estimated T1 700–2000 ms at 3.0T). The relative mean estimation error (MSE) for T1 estimation is less than 1.7% using the optimized TSI sequence, as opposed to less than 7.0% using DESPOT1 for normal brain tissues. The optimized TSI sequence achieves good stability by keeping the MSE under 7.0% over larger T1 values corresponding to different lesion tissues and the cerebrospinal fluid (up to 5000 ms). The T1 estimation accuracy using the new pulse sequence also shows improvement, which is more pronounced in low SNR scenarios.",7
Evolution of tumefactive lesions in multiple sclerosis: A 12-year study with serial imaging in a single patient,"Vasiliki N Ikonomidou, Nancy D Richert, Alexander Vortmeyer, Fernanda Tovar-Moll, Bibiana Bielekova, Natalie E Cook, Jeff H Duyn, Francesca Bagnato",2013/10,Journal Multiple Sclerosis Journal,"We describe the acute presentation and the long-term evolution of recurrent tumefactive lesions (TLs) in a patient with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis.

TL evolution was described by means of magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and cerebrospinal fluid tissue specific imaging (TSI) over the follow-up period. During the study period, the patient had three clinical relapses with only minimal disability progression. MTI demonstrated that only the peripheral portion of each TL reverted to pre-lesional MT ratios within six months’ post-enhancement.

Multirate SPAMM tagging,"Vasiliki N Ikonomidou, George D Sergiadis",2003/8/11,Journal IEEE transactions on biomedical engineering,"Many magnetic resonance tagging sequences rely on periodicity in order to produce a uniform tagging grid that covers the whole image plane.

In this paper, we present a combination of the spatial modulation of magnetization 1-1 method with selective excitation pulses that can be used in order to restrict the tagging grid only to regions of interest and produce tagging grid of different density in each region. The method is fast and easy to implement even on older or less expensive systems, since it does not require extensive gradient switching.",4
A Rotational Approach to Localized SPAMM 1–1 Tagging,"Vasiliki N Ikonomidou, George D Sergiadis",2002/8/1,Journal Journal of Magnetic Resonance,"Magnetic resonance tagging usually relies on controlling the phase dispersion of the transverse magnetization component. Phase dispersion is, however, affected by the inherent phase of selective excitation pulses, thus limiting their combination with tagging sequences to the application of refocusable pulses, as in the localized spatial modulation of magnetization (L-SPAMM) technique. In this study, we examine the effect of selective excitation pulses on a L-SPAMM 1–1 sequence, showing that in the case of two identical pulses the phase component is canceled out, and thus preemphasis and refocus gradients are not needed, allowing us to take advantage of a constant gradient throughout the tagging sequence, and also that one might choose nonrefocusable maximum and minimum phase pulses.",4

B1 mapping based on signal modeling with magnetization prepared 3D EPI,"VN Ikonomidou, JA de Zwart, JH Duyn, P van Gelderen",2005/5,Journal 13th Annual Meeting ISMRM,"Discussion & Conclusion: We have presented an EPI-based method for rapid acquisition of 3D maps of the excitation B1. The technique shows sufficient stability over a wide range of λprep. Use of a three-dimensional imaging technique has the advantage of minimizing errors associated with the profile of the selective imaging pulse. At the same time it allows a simple mathematical expression of the expected signal behavior. The signal is not acquired at a relaxed state, but in dynamic equilibrium, eliminating the need for a relaxation time interval. Imaging angles less than 90 are acceptable, and possibly better for fitting stability. Since SNR is enhanced due to the 3D acquisition, shorter TR values can also be considered. Both the imaging flip angle and the TR can be subject to further optimization.",3
Examining Choice in Self-directed Tiered Homework Assignments in College-Level Engineering Courses,"Vasiliki Ikonomidou, Anastasia P Samaras, Vikas Kotari",2016/6/26,Conference 2016 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"The concept of differentiated instruction (DI), ie, adjusting material delivery according to the readiness of each student, has gained substantial interest in K-12 education. Current literature suggests that it is an effective option for designing instruction in classrooms where there is significant difference in students’ academic readiness levels. Evidence suggests that different readiness levels are a reality in college classrooms, and with it come different student needs in order to succeed. However, there has been significantly less interest in the application of differentiated learning techniques at the college level and which this study begins to address. This may be due to the level of commitment required for DI, where the burden of design of individualized mini-curricula for each student falls on the instructor, and may not be realistic for engineering college faculty. Additionally, college students are adults, and adult learning theory suggests that as such they should be responsible for their own learning. Based on these notions, our wider question was whether we could provide a design where the student could make a choice for a learning pathway adapted to their own needs, based on both their interests and readiness levels. One key pedagogical intervention tested in the study was a tiered homework assignment. In our design, these homework assignments consisted of problem menus organized in three categories, corresponding to the levels of apply, analyze and creating (termed “design”) in Bloom’s taxonomy.

Clinical and imaging metrics for monitoring disease progression in patients with multiple sclerosis,"Francesca Bagnato, Joan M Ohayon, Mary Ehrmantraut, Annie W Chiu, Marco Riva, Vasiliki N Ikonomidou",2006/4/1,Source Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the CNS leading to clinical disability in 250,000–350,000 young adults in the USA and Europe. The disease affects both white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) tissues of the brain and spinal cord. While WM disease is easily quantified using currently available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, identification and quantification of GM disease present a daily challenge. Nonconventional brain and spinal cord MRI techniques, including magnetization transfer, MRI spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging, have improved our understanding of MS pathology in the deep GM. The sensitivity of high-resolution MRI obtained at a high magnetic field will improve the detection of spinal cord and brain cortical GM disease. The appropriate use of the above-mentioned techniques has the potential to more accurately explain the level of disability in MS patients.",2

Robustness of remote stress detection from visible spectrum recordings,"Balvinder Kaur, Sophia Moses, Megha Luthra, Vasiliki N Ikonomidou, Elizabeth Tarbox",2016/5/19,Conference Sensing and Analysis Technologies for Biomedical and Cognitive Applications 2016,"In our recent work, we have shown that it is possible to extract high fidelity timing information of the cardiac pulse wave from visible spectrum videos, which can then be used as a basis for stress detection. In that approach, we used both heart rate variability (HRV) metrics and the differential pulse transit time (dPTT) as indicators of the presence of stress. One of the main concerns in this analysis is its robustness in the presence of noise, as the remotely acquired signal that we call blood wave (BW) signal is degraded with respect to the signal acquired using contact sensors. In this work, we discuss the robustness of our metrics in the presence of multiplicative noise. Specifically, we study the effects of subtle motion due to respiration and changes in illumination levels due to light flickering on the BW signal, the HRV-driven features, and the dPTT. Our sensitivity study involved both Monte Carlo simulations and …",1
Detecting diffuse white matter alterations in healthy volunteers using Tissue Specific Imaging: Potential implications for cognitive function,"V Ikonomidou, S Stern, A Gallo, I Evangelou, J Ohayon, M Ehrmantraut, I Cortese, C Frantzis, H McFarland, R Kane, F Bagnato",2008,Journal Scientific Meeting and Exhibition of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,"Diffuse changes in white matter (WM), usually seen in MRI as distributed non-specific WM hyperintensities in T2 weighted images, are a common finding in neurologically healthy people. Although uncertainty still remains regarding their etiology, loss of myelinated axons, gliosis and vascular ecstasia [1, 2] have been suggested as potential causes. No clinical significance has been attributed to them. In the current study, we operate on the hypothesis that diffuse WM changes can also affect T1 of WM. Indeed, subtle T1 changes in normal WM have been reported in pathological conditions like multiple sclerosis [3]; however, conventional T1 weighted imaging techniques are not sensitive enough to depict slight changes in the range of normal WM T1, ie around 800-950 ms for 3T.",1

Mapping resting-state functional connectivity by perfusion MRI,"KH Chuang, P van Gelderen, J Bodurka, V Ikonomidou, A Koretsky, J Duyn, S Talagala",2006,Journal Proc. Intl. Soc. Mag. Reson. Med,"Resting-state, low frequency (< 0.08 Hz) fluctuation of BOLD signal has been shown to exhibit high correlation among functionally connected regions [1, 2]. Though the underlying mechanism is unclear, observation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) fluctuations could provide further information on this phenomenon. However, until now, very few papers have reported detection of resting-state connectivity based on perfusion MRI [3, 4]. The main challenges of using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI to detect this signal are low temporal resolution and low sensitivity and contamination of BOLD fluctuations. Use of close fitting receiver array coils can provide significant gains in ASL sensitivity [5, 6]. This in turn allows increased temporal resolution via reduction of the labeling and post labeling delay times. Another issue is that, since ASL time series are modulated by perfusion as well as BOLD fluctuations, a processing strategy to isolate perfusion changes without the BOLD contribution is required [7]. In this work we demonstrate perfusion based functional connectivity using continuous ASL (CASL) with a neck labeling coil [8] and a 16 channel receiver coil array [9, 10]. We also propose an analysis method to extract the CBF signal from ASL signal time-course without BOLD contamination.",1

Epileptic Seizure Detection Through Machine Learning Classification of Heart Rate Variability Features,"NICHOLAS BRENNER, DIVYA MATHUR, HASITA NALLURI, MIHIR SAVKAR, NORVIN WEST JR, Vasiliki Ikonomidou",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Affecting over fifty million people worldwide, epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which recurrent, unprovoked seizures occur due to abnormal electrical brain activity. The ultimate goal of a seizure detection algorithm is to prevent traumas from occurring during epileptic episodes, ensuring patient safety. Ongoing research has utilized heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, which looks at the time variation between consecutive heartbeats. We developed software which conditioned electrocardiogram (ECG) data of epilepsy patients to remove outliers and ectopic beats. The software then extracted HRV time, frequency, and Poincaré plot features over three-minute intervals, which were detrended using a cut off rate to provide a clear distinction between seizure and nonseizure signals. To facilitate accurate comparisons across features, each feature was normalized to be on a scale between-1 and 1, and seizure …",
A Novel Approach for Predicting Osteoporosis Using Texture Analysis on Magnetic Resonance Images,"PRITHWISH DASGUPTA, PHILIP MILTON, ANISHA RANGI, Vasiliki Ikonomidou",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Osteoporosis (OP), a particularly common disease among people above 65 years, makes bones weak and brittle. This predisposes an individual to fragility fractures that could result in fatalities. Currently, Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is the state-of-the-art technique for diagnosing OP. But people often postpone DXA scans due to limited compliance resulting in OP remaining undiagnosed until it becomes problematic. The elderly, on the other hand, often get Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans for other indications. The purpose of this research is to demonstrate that these MRI scans could be simultaneously used as a method to predict OP. We used MRI and DXA scans of 13 female and 13 male individuals obtained from the NIH Osteoarthritis Initiative. We considered three types of MRI scans: TSE, 2D MESE, and 3D DESS. Next, we performed texture analysis using a software tool called MaZda on …",
A Gait Analysis Device to Classify Normal vs. Abnormal Gaits in Flat Feet Patients,"Teaghan Doran, Winifred Allotey, Vasiliki Ikonomidou",2019/11/19,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Walking with flat feet can negatively affect a person’s back and lower extremities. Rehabilitation is the most common treatment, but ways to monitor progress outside of physical therapy sessions are needed. The end goal of this project is to develop a device that can monitor gait progress outside of the therapist’s office. A gait analysis device will be used to record the pressure exerted by the subject on four different parts of the soles of their feet as they walk. The idea is that if we obtain data of normal gaits and abnormal gaits, caused by flat feet, we can use the data to train an algorithm to classify each gait cycle as normal or abnormal. Work on this project focused on improving and troubleshooting an inner sole design that comprises pressure sensors that can provide gait information, and designing experiments to acquire gait data.

Tonic-Clonic and Clonic Seizure Detection through Non-Contact Affordable Means,"Rohan Voddhi, Norvin West Jr, Vasiliki Ikonomidou",2019/11/19,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Epilepsy is the condition of recurrent, unprovoked seizures and occurs when a person is predisposed to seizures because of a chronic pathological state (eg, brain tumor) or a genetic susceptibility. Approximately 50 million people suffer from epilepsy globally, making it one of the most common neurological diseases in the world. Currently, epileptic seizures are monitored and diagnosed using EEG combined with video recording but no known methods exist that are non-contact, affordable, and easy to access. Here we developed a system to detect clonic and tonic-clonic seizures based on their rhythmic natures. In the present program, key facial features are identified and tracked over time. Their locations and their movement over time are recorded; these data are then processed and a cyclic pattern corresponding to a seizure can be detected.

Reliability of Color-Based Pulse Detection Heart Rate Variability Analysis Software,"Karen Song, Vasiliki Ikonomidou",2019/11/19,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"When a human heart pumps blood, there are slight color changes in the forehead. These changes are unobservable by the naked eye but are detectable through cameras. Color-based pulse detection records the color change of a video subject’s forehead and outputs the RR intervals (time intervals between subsequent heartbeats); however, video quality can interfere with this process. One aspect that affects video quality is file compression. To test the reliability of color-based pulse detection and its dependence on the file format chosen, I examined 5 file compressions (. avi,. mov,. mpg,. wmv, and. mp4) on 5 videos of a light-complexioned subject and a dark-complexioned subject and compared the mean heart rate computed using color-based pulse detection with RR intervals generated from the Pan-Tompkins algorithm of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals on the subjects.

Machine Learning Based Facial Recognition,"Taaren Singh, Vasiliki Ikonomidou",2019/11/19,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Humans have an innate ability to recognize faces in nearly any situation, allowing us to differentiate one person from another, regardless of the environment. Local binary patterns (LBP) utilize depth perception to quantify the pixels of a subject’s face depending on the person’s unique facial structure. Through machine learning methodology, multiple faces can be stored in a system over time (known as training the system). As a system encounters more faces, its database expands and correspondingly grows artificially “smarter”, being able to identify more individuals. Using Python, a facial classifier was coded utilizing LBP to collect and store subjects’ faces with their corresponding names. Afterward, a live feed recognizer was coded, which also utilized LBP to convert live frames into grayscale images that could be compared and paired with those stored from the facial classifier. It was expected that the classifier …",
Texture Analysis for Evaluating Image Registration,"Vikas Kotari, Vasiliki N Ikonomidou",2017,Journal Proc. Intl. Soc. Mag. Reson. Med,"Accurate image registration is essential for both cross-sectional and longitudinal MR studies. In longitudinal studies aligning same contrast intra-subject images, which are the focus of our work, registration is assumed to be a rigid body problem. This assumption is questionable due to global and local changes in brain volume either due to hydration or atrophy. Consequently, misregistration at the voxel level may occur in these studies, which might lead to subject data being discarded. This misregistration is evident particularly around the cortex. Visual inspection of images is used to determine registration accuracy. While this approach is suitable for assessing alignment of landmark structures, it fails to capture the millimteric or sub-millimetric misregistrations. Automatic metrics can precisely estimate the overall performance of a given registration algorithm by employing an evaluation database. However, to estimate …",

Conventional T1 weighted imaging fails to visualize early changes in white matter, and doesn't characterize different degrees of damage.

cortical hypointensities and their association with cognitive disability in multiple sclerosis 1T,"Vasiliki N Ikonomidou, Joan Ohayon, Clelia Pellicano, Susan K Stern, Henry F McFarland, Francesca Bagnato, Zeena Salman, Robert Kane, Sungyoung Auh, Fredric K Cantor, Mary Ehrmantraut, Antonio Gallo","Abstract Background: Neocortical lesions (NLs) largely contribute to the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS), although their relevance in patients’ disability remains unknown.Objective: To assess the incidence of T1 hypointense NLs by 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with MS and examine neocortical lesion association with cognitive impairment. Methods: In this case-control study, 21 MS patients and 21 age-, sex-and years of education-matched healthy volunteers underwent:(i) a neuropsychological examination rating cognitive impairment (Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS);(ii) a 3.0-Tesla MRI inclusive of an isotropic 1.0 mm3 three-dimensional inversion prepared spoiled gradientrecalled-echo (3D-IRSPGR) image and T1-and T2-weighted images. Hypointensities on 3D-IRSPGR lying in the cortex, either entirely or partially were counted and association between NLs and cognitive impairment investigated. Results: A total of 95 NLs were observed in 14 (66.7%) patients. NLþ patients performed poorer (p ¼ 0.020) than NL-patients only on the delayed recall component of the California Verbal Learning Test. This difference lost statistical significance when a correction for white matter lesion volume was employed. Conclusions: Although T1 hypointense NLs may be present in a relatively high proportion of multiple sclerosis patients, the impact that they have in cognitive impairment is not independent from white matter disease.","Scholar articles cortical hypointensities and their association with cognitive disability in multiple sclerosis 1TVN Ikonomidou, J Ohayon, C Pellicano, SK Stern…Related articles ","Abstract Background: Neocortical lesions (NLs) largely contribute to the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS), although their relevance in patients’ disability remains unknown.",

Extended Multiple Periodicity Tagging Sequence,"VN Ikonomidou, GD Sergiadis","Magnetic resonance tagging is a technique for non-invasively examining tissue motion in-vivo. Recently, new methods, based on selective excitation techniques, have been proposed that are capable of producing tagging grids with arbitrary spacing. This aims at producing a varying density grid, better suited to the characteristics of the expected motion.Grids of varying density can also be produced using the superposition of localized DANTE tagging sequences of different periodicity. In this paper, we will demonstrate that the flexibility of the above combination can be further enhanced by introducing a phase shift between the individual pulses of the DANTE sequence.","Scholar articles Extended Multiple Periodicity Tagging SequenceVN Ikonomidou, GD SergiadisRelated articles ","Magnetic resonance tagging is a technique for non-invasively examining tissue motion in-vivo.
