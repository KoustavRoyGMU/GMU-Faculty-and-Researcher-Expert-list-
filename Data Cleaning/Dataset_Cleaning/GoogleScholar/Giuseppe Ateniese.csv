Provable data possession at untrusted stores,"Giuseppe Ateniese, Randal Burns, Reza Curtmola, Joseph Herring, Lea Kissner, Zachary Peterson, Dawn Song",2007/10/28,Book Proceedings of the 14th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,"We introduce a model for provable data possession (PDP) that allows a client that has stored data at an untrusted server to verify that the server possesses the original data without retrieving it. The model generates probabilistic proofs of possession by sampling random sets of blocks from the server, which drastically reduces I/O costs. The client maintains a constant amount of metadata to verify the proof. The challenge/response protocol transmits a small, constant amount of data, which minimizes network communication. Thus, the PDP model for remote data checking supports large data sets in widely-distributed storage system.",3702
Improved proxy re-encryption schemes with applications to secure distributed storage,"Giuseppe Ateniese, Kevin Fu, Matthew Green, Susan Hohenberger",2006/2/1,Journal ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),"In 1998, Blaze, Bleumer, and Strauss (BBS) proposed an application called atomic proxy re-encryption, in which a semitrusted proxy converts a ciphertext for Alice into a ciphertext for Bob without seeing the underlying plaintext. We predict that fast and secure re-encryption will become increasingly popular as a method for managing encrypted file systems. Although efficiently computable, the wide-spread adoption of BBS re-encryption has been hindered by considerable security risks. Following recent work of Dodis and Ivan, we present new re-encryption schemes that realize a stronger notion of security and demonstrate the usefulness of proxy re-encryption as a method of adding access control to a secure file system. Performance measurements of our experimental file system demonstrate that proxy re-encryption can work effectively in practice.",1967
Scalable and efficient provable data possession,"Giuseppe Ateniese, Roberto Di Pietro, Luigi V Mancini, Gene Tsudik",2008/9/22,Book Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Security and privacy in communication netowrks,"Storage outsourcing is a rising trend which prompts a number of interesting security issues, many of which have been extensively investigated in the past. However, Provable Data Possession (PDP) is a topic that has only recently appeared in the research literature. The main issue is how to frequently, efficiently and securely verify that a storage server is faithfully storing its client's (potentially very large) outsourced data. The storage server is assumed to be untrusted in terms of both security and reliability. (In other words, it might maliciously or accidentally erase hosted data; it might also relegate it to slow or off-line storage.) The problem is exacerbated by the client being a small computing device with limited resources. Prior work has addressed this problem using either public key cryptography or requiring the client to outsource its data in encrypted form.",1649

However, in the case of a dispute, the identity of a signature’s originator can be revealed (only) by a designated entity.

This work introduces a new provably secure group signature and a companion identity escrow scheme that are significantly more efficient than the state of the art. In its interactive, identity escrow form, our scheme is proven secure and coalition-resistant under the strong RSA and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumptions.

The general advantages of identity-based cryptography over conventional schemes relative to key distribution are even more pronounced in a chameleon hashing scheme, because the owner of a public key does not necessarily need to retrieve the associated secret key.

Our model of subversion generalizes previous work in several directions, and is inspired by the proliferation of software attacks (e.g., malware and buffer overflow attacks), and by the recent revelations of Edward Snowden about intelligence agencies trying to surreptitiously sabotage cryptographic algorithms. The main security requirement we put forward demands that a signature scheme should remain unforgeable even in the presence of an attacker applying SAs (within a certain class of allowed attacks) in a fully-adaptive and continuous fashion.

However, modern sensor are equipped with relatively large flash memories which make memory consumption a less critical requirement, and emerging energy harvesting technologies provide occasional energy peaks which could be exploited for anticipating otherwise costly computational tasks. These trends push for a reconsideration of pre-computation techniques, which are explored in this paper as follows:(1) we further optimize prior pre-computation techniques by exploiting more recent results on Cayley graph expanders,(2) we implement an ECDSA scheme relying on pre-computations over two different wireless sensor node platforms (TelosB and MICA2), and (3) we experimentally assess the relevant performance and energy costs.

Reducing Bias in Modeling Real-world Password Strength via Deep Learning and Dynamic Dictionaries.,"Dario Pasquini, Marco Cianfriglia, Giuseppe Ateniese, Massimo Bernaschi",2021/8/11,Conference USENIX Security Symposium,"Password security hinges on an in-depth understanding of the techniques adopted by attackers. Unfortunately, real-world adversaries resort to pragmatic guessing strategies such as dictionary attacks that are inherently difficult to model in password security studies. In order to be representative of the actual threat, dictionary attacks must be thoughtfully configured and tuned. However, this process requires a domainknowledge and expertise that cannot be easily replicated. The consequence of inaccurately calibrating dictionary attacks is the unreliability of password security analyses, impaired by a severe measurement bias.",19

And, as the need for more agile, private and secure data solutions continues to grow exponentially, rethinking the current structure of cloud storage is mission-critical for enterprises. By leveraging and building upon blockchain's unique attributes, including immutability, security to the data element level, distributed (no single point of failure), we have developed a solution prototype that allows data to be reliably stored while simultaneously being secured, with tamper-evident auditability, via blockchain.

Proof of storage-time: Efficiently checking continuous data availability,"Giuseppe Ateniese, Long Chen, Mohammad Etemad, Qiang Tang",2020,Journal Cryptology ePrint Archive,"A high-quality outsourced storage service is crucial for many existing applications. For example, hospitals and data centers need to guarantee the availability of their systems to perform routine daily activities. Such a system should protect users against downtime and ensure data availability over time. Continuous data availability is a critical property to measure the quality of an outsourced storage service, which implies that outsourced data is continuously available to the server during the entire storage period. We formally study the Proof of Storage-Time (PoSt), the notion initially proposed in the Filecoin whitepaper, which enables a verifier to audit the continuous data availability of an outsourced storage service. We provide a formal security model of PoSt and generic constructions that are proven secure under our definition. Moreover, our concrete instantiation can yield a PoSt protocol with an extremely efficient verification: a single hash computation to verify a proof of size around 200 bits.

Such an outsourcing trend leaves the possibility of inserting malicious circuitry (aka hardware Trojans) during the fabrication process, causing serious security concerns. Hardware Trojans are very hard and expensive to detect and can disrupt the entire circuit or covertly leak sensitive information via a subliminal channel. In this paper, we propose a formal model for assessing the security of ICs whose fabrication has been outsourced to an untrusted off-shore manufacturer. Our model captures that the IC specification and design are trusted but the fabrication facility (ies) may be malicious. Our objective is to investigate security in an ideal sense and follows a simulation based approach that ensures that Trojans cannot release any sensitive information to the outside. It follows that the Trojans' impact in the overall IC operation, in case they exist, will be negligible up to simulation. We then establish that such level of security is in fact achievable for the case of a single and of multiple outsourcing facilities. We present two compilers for ICs for the single outsourcing facility case relying on verifiable computation (VC) schemes, and another two compilers for the multiple outsourcing facilities case, one relying on multi-server VC schemes, and the other relying on secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols with certain suitable properties that are attainable by existing schemes",10

We show that probabilistic password meters inherently own the capability to describe the latent relation between password strength and password structure.

Nearly optimal verifiable data streaming (full version),"Johannes Krupp, Dominique Schröder, Mark Simkin, Dario Fiore, Giuseppe Ateniese, Stefan Nürnberger",2015,Journal Cryptology ePrint Archive,"The problem of verifiable data streaming (VDS) considers a client with limited computational and storage capacities that streams an a-priori unknown number of elements to an untrusted server. The client may retrieve and update any outsourced element. Other parties may verify each outsourced element's integrity using the client's public-key. All previous VDS constructions incur a bandwidth and computational overhead on both client and server side, which is at least logarithmic in the number of transmitted elements. We propose two novel, fundamentally different approaches to constructing VDS. The first scheme is based on a new cryptographic primitive called Chameleon Vector Commitment (CVC). A CVC is a trapdoor commitment scheme to a vector of messages where both commitments and openings have constant size. Using CVCs we construct a tree-based VDS protocol that has constant computational and bandwidth overhead on the client side. The second scheme shifts the workload to the server side by combining signature schemes with cryptographic accumulators. Here, all computations are constant, except for queries, where the computational cost of the server is linear in the total number of updates.",2

In this paper we construct a very e cient group signature scheme with security properties based on a set of wellstudied (and widely believed to be hard) computational problems.",1
What are GANs useful for?,"Briland Hitaj, Pablo M Olmos, Paolo Gasti, Giuseppe Ateniese, Fernando Pérez-Cruz","GANs have shown how deep neural networks can be successfully used for generative modeling. As a result, generative models based on neural networks are expected to impact many fields the same way that discriminative modeling based on neural networks did. Early uses of GANs led to impressive results: GANs successfully generated high-quality samples in high dimensional structured spaces, such as images and text, that were present in the training data. However, evaluating generative and discriminative models are fundamentally different tasks. While discriminative learning has a clear goal and a well-defined set of evaluation metrics, generative modeling is an intermediate step towards understanding the data or generate hypothesis. As such, the quality of implicit density estimation is hard to evaluate, because in general it is hard to measure how well a data sample is represented by the model. For instance, how can one assess whether a generative process is generating natural samples, sampled from the appropriate distribution? In this paper, we take a fresh look at GANs, and at the quality of their output. We observe that even though GANs might not be able to generate samples from the underlying distribution, they can still capture important structure information from data in high dimensional space. Our conclusion is that, in many applications, the ability to perform precise density estimation is not required for the construction of a useful generative model.

Universal Neural-Cracking-Machines: Self-Configurable Password Models from Auxiliary Data,"Dario Pasquini, Giuseppe Ateniese, Carmela Troncoso",2023/1/18,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.07628,"We develop the first universal password model -- a password model that, once pre-trained, can automatically adapt to any password distribution. To achieve this result, the model does not need to access any plaintext passwords from the target set. Instead, it exploits users' auxiliary information, such as email addresses, as a proxy signal to predict the underlying target password distribution. The model uses deep learning to capture the correlation between the auxiliary data of a group of users (e.g., users of a web application) and their passwords. It then exploits those patterns to create a tailored password model for the target community at inference time. No further training steps, targeted data collection, or prior knowledge of the community's password distribution is required. Besides defining a new state-of-the-art for password strength estimation, our model enables any end-user (e.g., system administrators) to autonomously generate tailored password models for their systems without the often unworkable requirement of collecting suitable training data and fitting the underlying password model. Ultimately, our framework enables the democratization of well-calibrated password models to the community, addressing a major challenge in the deployment of password security solutions on a large scale.",

AI is constantly changing our lives and has been applied to broad areas. When AI algorithms play a crucial role in bringing too much convenience to our society, they are also vulnerable to attacks. AI systems hacked by attackers may lead to incorrect classifications, property loss, and bad decision-making. The privacy issues of AI have also received more and more attention. Data used by AI models may reveal personal privacy, such as our consumption habits, medical information, and online transactions. Given AI models’ increased use in safety-critical and security applications, it is essential to ensure that such algorithms are robust to malicious adversaries and privacy preserved.",
Immunization against complete subversion without random oracles,"Giuseppe Ateniese, Danilo Francati, Bernardo Magri, Daniele Venturi",2021/3/6,Journal Theoretical Computer Science,"We seek constructions of general-purpose immunizers that take arbitrary cryptographic primitives, and transform them into ones that withstand a powerful “malicious but proud” adversary, who attempts to break security by possibly subverting the implementation of all algorithms (including the immunizer itself!), while trying not to be detected. This question is motivated by the recent evidence of cryptographic schemes being intentionally weakened, or designed together with hidden backdoors, e.g., with the scope of mass surveillance.",

"The Good, the Bad, and the (not so) Ugly: Many Facets of Cryptographic Backdoors","Bernardo Magri, Giuseppe Ateniese",2016/10,"Description Modern cryptography is concerned with the feasibility or infeasibility of securely realizing a task.

The most basic computational assumption made in cryptography is the existence of one-way functions. One-way functions are functions that are easy to compute but are hard to invert on almost all inputs. By just assuming the existence of one-way functions it is already possible to realize many cryptographic tasks, but there are some tasks that can only be realized by assuming the existence of trapdoor functions (also called backdoored functions). Trapdoor functions are easy to compute in one direction but hard to invert; the difference is the existence of a special value that allows the function to be easily inverted by any party that has knowledge of this special value.

From Pretty Good To Great: Enhancing PGP using Bitcoin and the Blockchain (LONG),"Duane Wilson, Giuseppe Ateniese",2015/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.04868,"PGP is built upon a Distributed Web of Trust in which a user’s trustworthiness is established by others who can vouch through a digital signature for that user’s identity. Preventing its wholesale adoption are a number of inherent weaknesses to include (but not limited to) the following: 1) Trust Relationships are built on a subjective honor system, 2) Only first degree relationships can be fully trusted, 3) Levels of trust are difficult to quantify with actual values, and 4) Issues with the Web of Trust itself (Certification and Endorsement). Although the security that PGP provides is proven to be reliable, it has largely failed to garner large scale adoption. In this paper, we propose several novel contributions to address the aforementioned issues with PGP and associated Web of Trust. To address the subjectivity of the Web of Trust, we provide a new certificate format based on Bitcoin which allows a user to verify a PGP certificate using Bitcoin identity-verification transactions-forming first degree trust relationships that are tied to actual values (ie, number of Bitcoins transferred during transaction). Secondly, we present the design of a novel Distributed PGP key server that leverages the Bitcoin transaction blockchain to store and retrieve Bitcoin-Based PGP certificates. Lastly, we provide a web prototype application that demonstrates several of these capabilities in an actual environment.",

In reality, most ISPs convert user traffic into NetFlow records for a concise representation that does not include, for instance, any payloads.

Currency and Correctness of Content in Object Storage Networks,"Randal Burns, Giuseppe Ateniese, Laura Graham","For large-scale replicated and distributed object systems to be useful, they must provide lightweight mechanisms to ensure that applications operate on the correct data—that they are accessing the most recent version and that the data have been stored and reproduced faithfully. This is particularly challenging in object systems in which we perform analysis at the data, because the application never witnesses the object data directly. Rather, it only sees results derived from those objects. At the same time, performing computation at the data is essential to achieve scale, because it avoids transmitting large amounts of data across global-scale networks. We focus on providing strong guarantees on the currency and correctness of data in adversarial networks in which storage sites and network links may exhibit arbitrary failures and act maliciously in producing and transmitting false data. At the same time, we eschew protocols that require synchronous collaboration among multiple parties, such as Byzantine agreement. Instead, we rely on the lazy, late-binding of data to trusted sites with strong identities (authentication), ie establish the correctness and recency of data prior to its use. This decision will allow the system to scale to the thousands of network participants necessary for defense applications. Provable data possession (PDP)[1] transforms a distributed systems ability to efficiently verify massive data sets on distributed object stores. We use PDP as the fundamental concept to provide data integrity and correctness.
