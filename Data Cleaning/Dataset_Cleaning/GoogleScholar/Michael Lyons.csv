Sampling from discrete distributions in combinational hardware with application to post-quantum cryptography,"Michael X Lyons, Kris Gaj",2020/3/9,"Conference 2020 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)","Random values from discrete distributions are typically generated from uniformly-random samples. A common technique is to use a cumulative distribution table (CDT) lookup for inversion sampling, but it is also possible to use Boolean functions to map a uniformly-random bit sequence into a value from a discrete distribution. This work presents a methodology for deriving such functions for any discrete distribution, encoding them in VHDL for implementation in combinational hardware, and (for moderate precision and sample space size) confirming the correctness of the produced distribution. The process is demonstrated using a discrete Gaussian distribution with a small sample space, but it is applicable to any discrete distribution with fixed parameters. Results are presented for sampling schemes from several submissions to the NIST PQC standardization process, comparing this method to CDT lookups on a …",6
"Toward Fair and Comprehensive Benchmarking of CAESAR Candidates in Hardware: Standard API, High-Speed Implementations in VHDL/Verilog, and Benchmarking Using FPGAs","Ekawat Homsirikamol, William Diehl, Ahmed Ferozpuri, Farnoud Farahmand, Michael X Lyons, Panasayya Yalla, Kris Gaj",2016/9/25,Conference Proc. Directions Authenticated Ciphers (DIAC),"Hardware performance of candidates in cryptographic contests has always been a very important evaluation factor, especially at the final stages of the competitions, when all remaining algorithms have been found to have adequate security strength. In CAESAR, for the first time, an attempt has been made to conduct hardware benchmarking of candidates at the very early stages of the contest, when the number of competing algorithms was still very large, namely there were still 29 authenticated cipher families remaining, with multiple variants for many of them.",4
A Cryptographic Application Modeling Environment for Research and Analysis,Michael X Lyons,"An interactive graphical environment is presented as an educational tool for teaching applications of cryptographic algorithms and other software systems. A design concept is shown, based on research into the efficacy of experiential learning in graphical environments. The implementation of the design allows for many different types of software components to be integrated with the system without rebuilding the system. The results of two test exercises are shown, validating the usefulness of the developed system as an educational aid.",Scholar articles A Cryptographic Application Modeling Environment for Research and AnalysisMX LyonsRelated articles All 3 versions ,"An interactive graphical environment is presented as an educational tool for teaching applications of cryptographic algorithms and other software systems.
