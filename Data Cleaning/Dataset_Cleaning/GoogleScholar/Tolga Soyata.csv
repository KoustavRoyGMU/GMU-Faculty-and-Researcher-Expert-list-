"Resistive computation: avoiding the power wall with low-leakage, STT-MRAM based computing","Xiaochen Guo, Engin Ipek, Tolga Soyata",2010/6/19,"Conference Computer Architecture (ISCA), ACM International Symposium on","As CMOS scales beyond the 45nm technology node, leakage concerns are starting to limit microprocessor performance growth. To keep dynamic power constant across process generations, traditional MOSFET scaling theory prescribes reducing supply and threshold voltages in proportion to device dimensions, a practice that induces an exponential increase in subthreshold leakage. As a result, leakage power has become comparable to dynamic power in current-generation processes, and will soon exceed it in magnitude if voltages are scaled down any further. Beyond this inflection point, multicore processors will not be able to afford keeping more than a small fraction of all cores active at any given moment. Multicore scaling will soon hit a power wall.",252

GPU parallel program development using CUDA,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Publisher CRC Press,"GPU Parallel Program Development using CUDA teaches GPU programming by showing the differences among different families of GPUs. This approach prepares the reader for the next generation and future generations of GPUs. The book emphasizes concepts that will remain relevant for a long time, rather than concepts that are platform-specific.

The book consists of three separate parts; it starts by explaining parallelism using CPU multi-threading in Part I. A few simple programs are used to demonstrate the concept of dividing a large task into multiple parallel sub-tasks and mapping them to CPU threads. Multiple ways of parallelizing the same task are analyzed and their pros/cons are studied in terms of both core and memory operation. Part II of the book introduces GPU massive parallelism. The same programs are parallelized on multiple Nvidia GPU platforms and the same performance analysis is repeated. Because the core and memory structures of CPUs and GPUs are different, the results differ in interesting ways.

"Supercapacitor Energy Buffering for Self-Sustainable, Continuous Sensing Systems","Meng Zhu, Moeen Hassanalieragh, Amal Fahad, Zhuan Chen, Tolga Soyata, Kai Shen",2016/3,"Source University of Rochester, Dept. of Computer Science","Continuous, high-data-rate visual sensing and processing in the field is important for intelligent transportation, environmental monitoring, and area/context awareness. Rechargeable batteries in self-sustainable systems suffer from adverse environmental impact and fast aging. Advancements in supercapacitor energy density and low-power processors have reached an inflection point, where a data-intensive visual sensing system can rely solely on supercapacitors for energy buffering. This paper demonstrates the first working prototype of such a system, consisting of eight 3,000-Farad supercapacitors, a custom-designed 70-mW controller/harvester board, and a Nexus 7 tablet computer. We leverage the voltage-to-stored-energy relationship in capacitors to enable precise energy buffer modeling (no more than 3% error in time-to-depletion prediction). We find the supercapacitor self-discharge (or leakage) to be a minor issue in practice where the operating power significantly exceeds the leakage power. However, accurate energy budgeting must account for the variation of effective capacitance—particularly lower capacitance at lower voltages nearing energy depletion. Precise energy budgeting allows model-driven system adaptation (such as dynamic CPU configurations on low-power chipsets) and consequently realizes high, stable operational quality-of-service. Our working prototype has been successfully deployed at a campus building rooftop where it analyzes nearby traffic patterns continuously.",6
Theoretical Foundation and GPU Implementation of Face Recognition,"William Dixon, Nathaniel Powers, Yang Song, Tolga Soyata",2015/6/30,Book Enabling Real-Time Mobile Cloud Computing Through Emerging Technologies,"Enabling a machine to detect and recognize faces requires significant computational power. This particular system of face recognition makes use of OpenCV (Computer Vision) libraries while leveraging Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate the process towards real-time. The processing and recognition algorithms are best sorted into three distinct steps: detection, projection, and search. Each of these steps has unique computational characteristics and requirements driving performance. In particular, the detection and projection processes can be accelerated significantly with GPU usage due to the data types and arithmetic types associated with the algorithms, such as matrix manipulation. This chapter provides a survey of the three main processes and how they contribute to the overarching recognition process.",5
ECG clock electrocardiogram based diagnostic device and method,"Jean-philippe Yves Couderc, Mehmet Kemal Aktas, Tolga Soyata, Alex Tyndall Page",2018/10/2,Patent office US,"An ECG clock electrocardiogram based diagnostic device and method is disclosed. The ECG clock provides a clear visual indicator of heart related anomalies such as Long QT syndrome over a longer span of time than can otherwise be assimilated by a medical practitioner. A variable such as QT interval is represented by a variable length radial hand similar to a watch or clock hand. The circular face of the ECG clock represents the diagnostic time interval, typically 24 hours. The resulting output or plot of the ECG clock portrays a circular or polar mapping of the heart related variable such as QT interval over the diagnostic time interval, facilitating rapid diagnosis of volumes of electrocardiogram data by a medical practitioner that has heretofore not been possible.",4

Energy efficient VM migration revisited: SLA assurance and minimum service disruption with available hosts,"Philip M Glasser, Ovunc Kocabas, Burak Kantarci, Tolga Soyata, Jeanna Matthews",2015,Conference High-capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies (HONET),"We propose a VM migration approach named Energy Saving Virtual Machine Migration with Minimum Disruption (ESVM3D) that reduces SLA violations by running VMs in a data center with more available physical hosts as opposed to shutting down idle hosts to save energy. As compared to previously proposed power minimizing VM migration algorithms, simulation results show a 40% reduction in VM migrations and a 10% energy savings as a result of this approach. In summary, ESVM3D achieves a 70% reduction in the number of host shutdowns, resulting in a negligible SLA degradation (≤0.1%) as compared to the previously proposed approaches, translating to a similar SLA performance and without a degradation in energy consumption.",3
A Voting-Enhanced Dynamic-Window-Length Classifier for SSVEP-Based BCIs,"Hadi Habibzadeh, James JS Norton, Theresa M Vaughan, Tolga Soyata, Daphney-Stavroula Zois",2021/8/24,Journal IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,"We present a dynamic window-length classifier for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that does not require the user to choose a feature extraction method or channel set. Instead, the classifier uses multiple feature extraction methods and channel selections to infer the SSVEP and relies on majority voting to pick the most likely target. The classifier extends the window length dynamically if no target obtains the majority of votes. Compared with existing solutions, our classifier: (i) does not assume that any single feature extraction method will consistently outperform the others; (ii) adapts the channel selection to individual users or tasks; (iii) uses dynamic window lengths; (iv) is unsupervised (i.e., does not need training). Collectively, these characteristics make the classifier easy-to-use, especially for caregivers and others with limited technical expertise. We evaluated …",1
An Unsupervised Channel Selection Method for SSVEP-based Brain Computer Interfaces,"Ethan Webster, Hadi Habibzadeh, Tolga Soyata",2019,"Description Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide an alternative communication channel for people with motor deficits that prevent normal communication. The underlying premise of a BCI is that a neuroimaging process such as electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to measure the user’s brain activity as signals. The obtained signals are analyzed to determine the user’s intended actions and a computer system can be used to replace voluntary muscle activity as a means of communication. The information transfer rate (ITR) of an algorithm used for determining the user’s intentions greatly affects the perceived practicality of the BCI system. Such algorithms are divided into two main categories, supervised and unsupervised. While the former achieves higher ITR, the latter is most useful when the user is unable to be involved in the calibration process of the BCI system.","Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide an alternative communication channel for people with motor deficits that prevent normal communication.

Understanding GPU Cores,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter examines how the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) actually executes the blocks. It explores how the concept of warp ties to the design of the GPU cores and their placement inside a streaming multiprocessor (SM). The chapter presents many different versions of the kernels inside the imflipG.cu and imedgeG.cu programs, run them, and observe their performance. It then runs these experiments in four different GPU architecture families: Fermi, Kepler, Maxwell, and Pascal. The most noticeable difference of Kepler SMX structure — as compared to Fermi — is the introduction of the double precision units (DPU). Every Compute-Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) core is designed to work at a base clock frequency and a boost clock frequency. For example, the GTX Titan Z has a base clock frequency of 705 MHz and a boost clock frequency of 875 MHz, which is 24% higher.",
Understanding the Cores and Memory,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter examines what happens inside the core and during the memory transfers from the CPU to the main memory. In the early 1970s, INTEL designed a programmable chip in the beginning days of the concept of a ""microprocessor"", or ""CPU"", a digital device that can execute a program stored in memory. INTEL designed the 4004 processor to have 12 address bits, capable of addressing 4096 Bytes. INTEL designed support chips, such as an I/O controller and memory controller to allow their customers to interface the 4004 CPU to the memory chips they bought somewhere else, they did not particularly focus on making memory chips themselves. About 10 years after the introduction of the first CPUs, CPU designers introduced a type of static random access memory that could be built right into the CPU. They called it cache memory that was able to buffer a very small portion of the main memory.",
Understanding GPU Hardware Architecture,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter introduces the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) edge detection program – imedgeG.cu and discusses its performance. It relates this performance to the building blocks of the GPU, such as the GPU cores and streaming multiprocessors, which are the execution units that house a bunch of these GPU cores. The chapter focuses on the hardware at a high level to get an idea about how the cores and memory are organized and how the data flows inside the GPU. Shared Cache Memory is the only shared memory in each GPU and it is the Last Level Cache (LLC). The GPU inside the LLC is surprisingly small compared to the CPU cache memory. Host Interface is the controller inside the GPU that is responsible for interfacing to the Peripheral Component Interconnect express (PCIe) bus. This is what allows the GPU to shuttle data back and forth between the CPU and itself.",
Understanding GPU Memory,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter focuses on the memory architecture of different Nvidia Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) families and improve programmer's kernels so their access to the data in different memory regions is efficient, i.e., programmers will make them memory friendly. It explains how to use a very important tool named Compute-Unified Device Architecture Occupancy Calculator, which allows programmers to establish a formal methodology for determining kernel launch parameters to ensure optimum resource utilization inside the streaming multiprocessors (SMs) of the GPU. The most important type of memory in a GPU is the shared memory. Shared memory is an SM-level resource. Each SM has its own shared memory and every block requests a certain amount of it. The instruction cache and instruction buffer also reside in the SMs of the GPU. They cache the machine code instructions that are needed to run the kernels …",
CUDA Streams,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"In a Compute-Unified Device Architecture program, first the data must be transferred from the CPU memory into the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) memory; it is only when the data is in GPU memory that the GPU cores can access it and process it. When the kernel execution is done, the processed data must be transferred back into the CPU memory. A virtual address is only an ""illusion"" and cannot be used to access any data unless it is translated into a physical address; a physical address is an actual address that is used to access the data in dynamic random access memory main memory. Nvidia GPUs need two different types of engines to implement streaming: kernel execution engine, and copy engine. The purpose of the copy engine is to queue the incoming and outgoing operations and perform them when the Peripheral Component Interconnect express bus is available.",
Improving Our First Parallel CPU Program,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter explains the interaction among all parties that contribute to the performance of a program. They are the programmer, compiler, Operating System (OS), and hardware. Compiler is a large piece of code that is packed with routine functionality for two things: compilation, and optimization. Aside from how many cores a CPU has, there is another consideration that relates to the cores; almost every CPU manufacturer started manufacturing in order cores and upgraded their design to out of order in their more advanced family of offerings. If a thread was designed by the programmer to require minimal core resources, it could benefit significantly from multithreading. These kinds of threads are called thin threads, whereas the ones that require excessive amounts of core resources are called thick threads. The maximum number of software thread is only limited by the internal OS parameters, whereas the number …",
CUDA Host/Device Programming Model,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter focuses on the parts of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) programming that involves both the CPU and GPU, which are the launch dimensions of a GPU kernel, Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express bandwidth and its impact on the overall performance, and the memory bandwidth of the CPU and the GPU. It provides an example output of the imflipG.cu, when run with the 'V' option — for vertical flip — and a block size of 256, using the astronaut.bmp image. The chapter focuses on the kernel execution time. A grid is a bunch of blocks, arranged in a 1D or 2D fashion. Blocks are the unit element of launch. The way a GPU programmer conceptualizes a program is that a giant tasks gets chopped up into blocks that can execute independently. When programmers study Compute-Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) assembly language they will find that a thread is called a lane in the Parallel …",
Developing Our First Parallel CPU Program,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter discusses the first CPU parallel program, imflipP.c. It explains the concepts that are the backbone of a parallel program. Each thread executes its assigned task and returns. The entire purpose of creating more than one thread was to execute things faster. This, by definition, means that the more threads people create, the more task splitting they have to do, and the more data splitting they have to do. A Bitmap (BMP) file is an uncompressed image file. This means that by knowing the size of the image, people can easily determine the size of the file that the image is stored in. The chapter focuses on the concept of compression. A BMP file stores ""raw"" image pixels without compressing them; because compression is not performed, no additional processing is necessary before each pixel is stored in a BMP file.",
Introduction to CPU Parallel Programming,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"Parallel programming turned from an exotic programming model in early 2000 to the only acceptable programming model as of 2015. Even if the story of ""multiple cores within a single CPU"" sounded like a dream come true, it meant that the programmers would now have to learn the parallel programming methods to take advantage of both of these cores. If a CPU could execute two programs at the same time, this automatically implied that a programmer had to write those two programs. The reason for the name of multi-threaded programming when the CPU makers started designing multi-core architectures, they quickly realized that it wasn't difficult to add the capability to execute two tasks within one core by sharing some of the core resources, such as cache memory. On the mobile processor side, iPhones and Android phones all have two or four cores.",
Thread Management and Synchronization,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter introduces an image edge detection program. Edge detection is actually one of the most common image processing tasks and is an essential operation that the human retina performs. The purpose of imedge.c is to create a program that is core-heavy, memory-heavy, and is composed of multiple independent operations. First of all, when multiple threads are updating a variable, there is the danger of one thread overwriting that variable's value before another thread gets a chance to read the correct value. This can be prevented with a MUTEX structure that allows the threads to update a variable's value in a ""thread-safe"" manner, completely eliminating the possibility for one thread to read an incorrect value.",
Introduction to GPU Parallelism and CUDA,Tolga Soyata,2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"Early Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in the late 1990s strictly focused on delivering as high of a floating point performance as possible. This freed the CPU resources and allowed a PC to perform 5× or 20× better in games. Apple computers used a different strategy to build a GPU-like processing power into their computers, but sooner or later the personal computer (PC) and Mac lines have converged and they started using GPUs from the same manufacturers. Nvidia introduced their language Computer-Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) in 2007, which was — and is — designed strictly for Nvidia platforms. The initial CUDA language developers had the following dilemma: CUDA had to be a programming language that allowed the programmers to write code for both the CPU and the GPU. CUDA had to be based on the C programming language to provide high performance.",
Other GPU Programming Languages,"Sam Miller, Andrew Boggio-Dandry, Tolga Soyata",2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter focuses on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) programming languages other than OpenCL and Compute-Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). It presents some of the common Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), such as Open Graphics Library (OpenGL), OpenGL Embedded Systems (ES), OpenCV, and Apple's Metal API. Python has the ability to write GPU code through two powerful libraries, PyOpenCL and PyCUDA. They closely follow the OpenCL and CUDA APIs, respectively, and abstract away much of the boilerplate code often needed to write GPU code. The base library itself is written in C++ so that Python can stay out of the way for maximum performance. One of the unique and very convenient options within PyOpenCL and PyCUDA is the ability to quickly write kernels to perform element-wise operations. An element-wise operation is an operation that is performed on every single …",
CUDA Libraries,"Mohamadhadi Habibzadeh, Omid Rajabi Shishvan, Tolga Soyata",2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"Compute-Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programmers typically use high level libraries, such as cuBLAS, cuFFT, etc. and use CUDA itself as a glue language, to make everything work together. The roots of Basic Linear Algebra Subprogram (BLAS) go back to the late 1970s and were initially written in Fortran. cuBLAS is an implementation of BLAS on the CUDA architecture. cuBLAS Application Programming Interface (API) provide support for vector and matrix algebraic operations such as addition, multiplication, etc., allowing developers to accelerate their programs easily. Every cuBLAS API function comes in four different data types; single precision floating point, double precision floating point, complex single precision floating point, and complex double precision floating point. cuFFT is the CUDA Fast Fourier Transform API library, which allows working in the frequency domain by computing the frequency …",
Deep Learning Using CUDA,"Omid Rajabi Shishvan, Tolga Soyata",2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter examines how Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can be used in deep learning. Deep learning is an emerging machine intelligence algorithm based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs were proposed to be computational models of neurological systems; they were designed to ""learn"" performing a certain task by mimicking the way a brain learns. ANNs are formed by multiple layers of ""neurons"" connected to each other, which create a network that takes input data, processes the data in each layer, and creates an output in the final layer. Activation functions in a neuron are implemented to introduce non-linearity to the network. The ANNs, in which the connections between their neurons do not make a cycle, are called Feed-Forward Neural Networks. cuDNN is a library that provides support for implementing deep networks on GPUs. Although using a GPU instead of a CPU already provides …",
Introduction to OpenCL,"Chase Conklin, Tolga Soyata",2018/1/19,Book GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA,"This chapter focuses on OpenCL, which is the most popular Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) programming language, excluding Compute-Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). It examines how OpenCL simplifies writing multiplatform parallel programs. OpenCL was released in 2009 by the Khronos Group as a framework for writing parallel programs on many different platforms. Unlike CUDA, which only runs on Nvidia GPUs, OpenCL code is capable of running on CPUs, GPUs, and other devices such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and digital signal processors (DSPs), as long as the device supports OpenCL. OpenCL supports many different devices, but it is up to the device manufacturer to implement the drivers that allow OpenCL to work on their devices. These different implementations are known as platforms. Unlike CUDA, which operates on either synchronous blocking calls, or can operate …",
