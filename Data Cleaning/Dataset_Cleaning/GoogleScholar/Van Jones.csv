Free-surface flow interactions with deformable structures using an SPH–FEM model,"Qing Yang, Van Jones, Leigh McCue",2012/12/1,Journal Ocean engineering,"A two-dimensional SPH–FEM model is proposed to investigate its application in the fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problem. The fluid model is based on the theory of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and the structural dynamics employ a large-deformation Finite Element Method (FEM). This paper describes the basics of both SPH and FEM models and presents the development of a loosely coupled SPH–FEM model. Validation results of two benchmark FSI problems are illustrated. The first test case is flow in a sloshing tank interacting with an elastic body (Souto-Iglesias et al., 2008) and the second one is dam-break flow through an elastic gate (Antoci et al., 2007). The results obtained with the SPH–FEM model show good agreement with published experimental results and suggest that the SPH–FEM model is a viable and effective numerical tool for FSI problems.",195
Coupled SPH-FVM simulation within the OpenFOAM framework,"Pankaj Kumar, Qing Yang, Van Jones, Leigh McCue-Weil",2015/1/1,Journal Procedia Iutam,"This paper discusses coupling of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Finite Volume Method (FVM) approaches within the OpenFOAM framework to capitalize upon the benefits of both meshed and meshless methods. In the work described herein, the mesh-free, particle-based, Lagrangian SPH method is used at free surfaces or near deformable boundaries, whereas the grid-based Eulerian FVM method is used over the larger fluid domain. For the SPH portion of the simulation, dynamic virtual particles in addition of real boundary particles are used to mitigate boundary deficiencies. The introduction of artificial viscosity at the air-water interface avoids instabilities associated with the high density ratio. The coupled system is validated by modeling a dam-break problem and comparing it with an experiment.",27

Validation of a SPH-FEM model for seal dynamics of surface effect ships,"Dr Yang, Van Jones, Dr Kumar, Dr McCue",2013/12/1,Journal Naval Engineers Journal,"A two-dimensional, loosely coupled SPH-FEM model is utilized to investigate its application in the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems for Air Cushion Vehicles (ACV) and Surface Effect Ships (SES). The fluid model is based on the theory of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), and the structural dynamics model employs a large-deformation Finite Element Methods (FEM). A two-dimensional free-stream flow interacting with a deformable, pressurized surface, such as an ACV/SES bow seal, is simulated. The dynamics of deformable surfaces such as the skirt/seal systems of the ACV/SES utilize the large-deformation FEM model. The fluid part, including the air inside the chamber and water, are simulated by SPH. A validation case is performed via comparison with experimental data (Zalek and Doctors, 2010). The validation results have suggested that this SPH-FEM model accurately reproduces the …",3
Underwater Gas Expansion and Deflagration,"Van Jones, Kariann Vander Pol, John Gilbert, Leigh McCue-Weil",2013/10,Journal arXiv e-prints,The underwater combustion of a propane-air mixture in an acrylic cylinder is captured on video from multiple angles.

SPH Corrección de la deficienccia de límites para la mejora de condiciones de contornos en superficies deformables,"Van Jones, Qing Yang, Leigh McCue-Weil",2010/7/30,Journal Ciencia y tecnología de buques,"Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a meshless, Lagrangian CFD method. SPH often utilizes static virtual particles to correct for integral deficiencies that occur near boundaries. These virtual particles, while useful in most cases, can be difficult to implement for objects which experience large deformations. As an alternative to virtual particles, a repulsive force algorithm is presented which loosely emulates the presence of virtual particles in the SPH momentum equation.",
