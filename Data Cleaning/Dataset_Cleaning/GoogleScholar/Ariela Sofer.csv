Evaluation of 3D reconstruction algorithms for a small animal PET camera,"CA Johnson, J Seidel, RE Carson, WR Gandler, A Sofer, MV Green, ME Daube-Witherspoon",1997/6,Journal IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science,"The use of paired, opposing position-sensitive phototube scintillation cameras (SCs) operating in coincidence for small animal imaging with positron emitters is currently under study. Because of the low sensitivity of the system even in 3D mode and the need to produce images with high resolution, it was postulated that a 3D expectation maximization (EM) reconstruction algorithm might be well suited for this application. The authors investigated six reconstruction algorithms for the 3D SC PET camera: 2D filtered back-projection (FBP), 3D reprojection (3DRP), 2D EM, 3D EM, 2D ordered subset EM (OSEM), and 3D OSEM. Noise was assessed for all slices by the coefficient of variation in a simulated uniform cylinder. Resolution was assessed from a simulation of 15 point sources in the warm background of the uniform cylinder. At comparable noise levels, the resolution achieved with EM and OSEM (0.9-mm to 1.2-mm …",125
A barrier method for large-scale constrained optimization,"Stephen G Nash, Ariela Sofer",1993/2,Journal ORSA Journal on computing,"A logarithmic barrier method is applied to the solution of a nonlinear programming problem with inequality constraints. An approximation to the Newton direction is derived that avoids the ill conditioning normally associated with barrier methods. This approximation can be used within a truncated-Newton method, and hence is suitable for large-scale problems; the approximation can also be used in the context of a parallel algorithm. Enhancements to the basic barrier method are described that improve its efficiency and reliability. The resulting method can be shown to be a primal-dual method when the objective function is convex and all of the constraints are linear. Computational experiments are presented where the method is applied to 1000-variable problems with bound constraints.",89

As a result, it may be desirable to consider alternative numerical algorithms. We compare the performance of two methods motivated by barrier functions. The first is a stabilized form of the classical barrier method, where a numerically stable approximation to the Newton direction is used when the barrier parameter is small. The second is a modified barrier method where a barrier function is applied to a shifted form of the problem, and the resulting barrier terms are scaled by estimates of the optimal Lagrange multipliers. The condition number of the Hessian matrix of the resulting modified barrier function remains bounded as the solution to the constrained optimization problem is …",84

Interior-point methodology for 3-D PET reconstruction,"Calvin A Johnson, Jürgen Seidel, Ariela Sofer",2000/4,Journal IEEE Transactions on medical imaging,"Interior-point methods have been successfully applied to a wide variety of linear and nonlinear programming applications. This paper presents a class of algorithms, based on path-following interior-point methodology, for performing regularized maximum-likelihood (ML) reconstructions on three-dimensional (3-D) emission tomography data. The algorithms solve a sequence of subproblems that converge to the regularized maximum likelihood solution from the interior of the feasible region (the nonnegative orthant). The authors propose two methods, a primal method which updates only the primal image variables and a primal-dual method which simultaneously updates the primal variables and the Lagrange multipliers. A parallel implementation permits the interior-point methods to scale to very large reconstruction problems. Termination is based on well-defined convergence measures, namely, the Karush-Kuhn …",67
Assessing a search direction within a truncated-Newton method,"Stephen G Nash, Ariela Sofer",1990/7/1,Journal Operations Research Letters,"Truncated-Newton methods for nonlinear optimization compute a search direction by approximately solving the Newton equations, typically via the conjugate-gradient algorithm.

The techniques have other uses, however, and are applied here to a class of problems in the calculus of variations. Numerical tests are also included.",62
Block truncated-Newton methods for parallel optimization,"Stephen G Nash, Ariela Sofer",1989/8,Journal Mathematical Programming,"Truncated-Newton methods are a class of optimization methods suitable for large scale problems. At each iteration, a search direction is obtained by approximately solving the Newton equations using an iterative method. In this way, matrix costs and second-derivative calculations are avoided, hence removing the major drawbacks of Newton's method. In this form, the algorithms are well-suited for vectorization. Further improvements in performance are sought by using block iterative methods for computing the search direction. In particular, conjugate-gradient-type methods are considered. Computational experience on a hypercube computer is reported, indicating that on some problems the improvements in performance can be better than that attributable to parallelism alone.",60
A Bayesian modification to the Jelinski-Moranda software reliability growth model,"Bev Littlewood, Ariela Sofer",1987/3/1,Journal Software engineering journal,"The Jelinski-Moranda (JM) model for software reliability growth is one of the most commonly cited (often in its guise as the ‘Musa model’). Recent studies show that the reliability estimates and predictions given by the model are often grossly inaccurate. It has been suggested that one reason for this poor performance may be the use of the maximum-likelihood method of inference. This paper describes a Bayesian version of the model and shows that it is sometimes an improvement on JM. However, both versions have a tendency to give optimistic answers, probably owing to a key, but implausible, underlying assumption common to both models. The authors conclude that the generally poor performance of the models is such that they should only be used with great caution.",46
A data-parallel algorithm for iterative tomographic image reconstruction,"Calvin A Johnson, Ariela Sofer",1999/2/26,Conference Proceedings. Frontiers' 99. Seventh Symposium on the Frontiers of Massively Parallel Computation,"In the tomographic imaging problem images are reconstructed from a set of measured projections. Iterative reconstruction methods are computationally intensive alternatives to the more traditional Fourier-based methods. Despite their high cost, the popularity of these methods is increasing because of the advantages they pose. Although numerous iterative methods have been proposed over the years, all of these methods can be shown to have a similar computational structure. This paper presents a parallel algorithm that we originally developed for performing the expectation maximization algorithm in emission tomography. This algorithm is capable of exploiting the sparsity and symmetries of the model in a computationally efficient manner. Our parallelization scheme is based upon decomposition of the measurement-space vectors. We demonstrate that such a parallelization scheme is applicable to the vast …",43
A general-purpose parallel algorithm for unconstrained optimization,"Stephen G Nash, Ariela Sofer",1991/11,Journal SIAM Journal on Optimization,"This paper describes a general-purpose algorithm for unconstrained optimization that is suitable for a parallel computer. It is designed to be as easy to use as traditional algorithms for this problem, requiring only that a (scalar) subroutine be provided to evaluate the objective function and its gradient vector of first derivatives. The algorithm used is a block truncated-Newton method. Truncated-Newton methods are a class of methods that compromise on Newton’s method so that large problems can be solved. Enhancements to the basic method suitable for a parallel computer are described. These include a revised data storage scheme, new preconditioning and initialization strategies to accelerate the method, a parallel line search, revised stopping rules for the inner algorithm, and a new “nonlinearity” test to determine the adequacy of the quadratic model.

A nonparametric software-reliability growth model,"Ariela Sofer, Douglas R Miller",1991/8,Journal IEEE Transactions on Reliability,"The authors (Proc. Eighth Int. Conf. Software Eng., London, England, p.343-4, 1985) previously introduced a nonparametric model for software-reliability growth which is based on complete monotonicity of the failure rate. The authors extend the completely monotone software model by developing a method for providing long-range predictions of reliability growth, based on the model. They derive upper and lower bounds on extrapolation of the failure rate and the mean function. These are then used to obtain estimates for the future software failure rate and the mean future number of failures. Preliminary evaluation indicates that the method is competitive with parametric approaches, while being more robust.< >",39
On the quality of software reliability prediction,"PA Keiller, B Littlewood, DR Miller, A Sofer",1983,Conference Electronic Systems Effectiveness and Life Cycle Costing,We suggest that users are interested solely in the quality of predictions which can be obtained from software reliability models. Some ways of analysing the quality of predictions are proposed and several models and inference procedures are compared on real software failure data sets. We conclude that some predictions are extremely poor: notably those arising from ML analysis of the Jelinski-Moranda model. Others seem quite good. We suggest promising areas for future work.,32
Optimal biopsy protocols for prostate cancer,"Ariela Sofer, Jianchao Zeng, Seong K Mun",2003/3,Journal Annals of Operations Research,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among American men. Biopsy for prostate cancer is a procedure known as transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy. Because of the low resolution of ultrasound, the urologist cannot usually distinguish between cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, most biopsies follow standard protocols based on long-term experience of physicians. Recent studies indicate that these protocols have a significant rate of false negative diagnoses. In this research we use real prostate specimens removed by prostatectomy to develop a 3-D distribution map of cancer in the prostate, and use this to develop optimized biopsy procedures. The new procedures have detection rates that are significantly higher than those of current procedures, and thus have the potential to increase the rate of early detection of prostate cancer.",27
A primal-dual method for large-scale image reconstruction in emission tomography,"Calvin A Johnson, Ariela Sofer",2001,Journal SIAM Journal on Optimization,"In emission tomography, images can be reconstructed from a set of measured projections using a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. In this paper, we present a primal-dual algorithm for large-scale three-dimensional image reconstruction. The primal-dual method is specialized to the ML reconstruction problem. The reconstruction problem is extremely large; in several of our data sets the Hessian of the objective function is the product of a 1.4 million by 63 million matrix and its scaled transpose. As such, we consider only approaches that are suitable for large-scale parallel computation. We apply a stabilization technique to the system of equations for computing the primal direction and demonstrate the need for stabilization when approximately solving the system using an early-terminated conjugate gradient iteration.",25

On the complexity of a practical interior-point method,"Stephen G Nash, Ariela Sofer",1998/8,Journal SIAM Journal on Optimization,"The theory of self-concordance in convex optimization has been used to analyze the complexity of interior-point methods based on Newton's method. For large problems, it may be impractical to use Newton's method; here we analyze a truncated-Newton method, in which an approximation to the Newton search direction is used. In addition, practical interior-point methods often include enhancements such as extrapolation that are absent from the theoretical algorithms analyzed previously. We derive theoretical results that apply to such an algorithm, one similar to a sophisticated computer implementation of a barrier method. The results for a single barrier subproblem are a satisfying extension of the results for Newton's method. When extrapolation is used in the overall barrier method, however, our results are more limited. We indicate (by both theoretical arguments and examples) why more elaborate results may be …",20

Development of a New Image-Guided Prostate Biopsy System,"Jianchao Zeng, Ariela Sofer, Seong K Mun",2001,"Conference Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention–MICCAI 2001: 4th International Conference Utrecht, The Netherlands, October 14–17, 2001 Proceedings 4","This paper presents a new image-guided prostate biopsy system under development. The system features a 3-D prostate cancer distribution atlas and new biopsy protocols optimized based on the cancer atlas using a nonlinear integer programming approach. Both the cancer atlas and the optimal protocols are being dynamically registered and superimposed onto the trans-rectal ultrasound images during live-patient biopsy procedures. Clear visual guidance will be provided to the physicians by color-coded spots on top of the ultrasound images, which represent best possible targets for biopsy. Clinical test will be performed to evaluate the system.",
Interior-Point Methodology for Large-Scale Regularized Maximum Likelihood Reconstruction in Emission Tomography,"Calvin A Johnson, Ariela Sofer",1997/6/9,"Description Interior-point methods possess strong theoretical properties and have been successfully applied to a wide variety of linear and nonlinear programming applications. This paper presents a class of algorithms, based on interior-point methodology, for performing regularized maximum likelihood reconstructions on 3-D emission tomography data. The algorithms solve a sequence of subproblems that converge to the regularized maximum likelihood solution from the interior of the feasible region (the non-negative orthant). We propose two methods, a primal method which updates only the primal image variables and a primal-dual method which simultaneously updates the primal variables and the Lagrange multipliers. Termination to a solution of desired accuracy is based on well-defined convergence measures. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of the interior-point methods using both data from a small animal scanner and Monte Carlo simulated data. We present a parallel implementation that permits the interior-point methods to scale to very large reconstruction problems.","Interior-point methods possess strong theoretical properties and have been successfully applied to a wide variety of linear and nonlinear programming applications.

Preconditioners for large-scale optimization,"S Nash, A Sofer",1994/12/31,Issue CONF-9408161-,"A good preconditioner can accelerate the convergence of an optimization algorithm. We have developed some nasty-looking formulas for preconditioners that can be used for constrained optimization. But appearances can be deceiving. The formulas work well, and they are easy to use (at least for the computer). Although these preconditioners were developed with constrained optimization in mind, they have other uses. In particular we have applied them to a class of problems that arise in the calculus of variations.",

Software models: A Bayesian approach to parameter estimation in the Jelenski-Moranda software reliability model,"B Littlewood, A Sofer",1981/1/1,Journal NASA. Goddard Space Flight Center Proc. of the Sixth Ann. Software Eng. Workshop,"Maximum likelihood estimation procedures for the Jelinski-Moranda software reliability model often give misleading answers. A reparameterization and a Bayesian analysis eliminate some of the problems incurred by MLE methods and often give better predictions on sets of real and simulated data. Practical difficulties in estimating the initial number of errors N and the failure rate of each error phi by the method of maximum likelihood are: N, the MLE of N, is occasionally infinite (i.e., the routines for calculating N and phi do not converge). It is shown that N is finite sub i only if the regression line of the interevent times t sub i vs. i has positive slope. A serious problem is that often N approximates n, the sample size, and sometimes N = n. Thus the MLE predicts that the program is perfect even when it is far from being so. Only when almost all failures have been removed can N and phi be trusted near the end of debugging.",
