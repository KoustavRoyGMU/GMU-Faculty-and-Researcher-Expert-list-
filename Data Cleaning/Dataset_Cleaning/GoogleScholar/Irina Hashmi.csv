Basin hopping as a general and versatile optimization framework for the characterization of biological macromolecules,"Brian Olson, Irina Hashmi, Kevin Molloy, Amarda Shehu",2012/1/1,Journal Advances in Artificial Intelligence,"Since its introduction, the basin hopping (BH) framework has proven useful for hard nonlinear optimization problems with multiple variables and modalities. Applications span a wide range, from packing problems in geometry to characterization of molecular states in statistical physics. BH is seeing a reemergence in computational structural biology due to its ability to obtain a coarse-grained representation of the protein energy surface in terms of local minima. In this paper, we show that the BH framework is general and versatile, allowing to address problems related to the characterization of protein structure, assembly, and motion due to its fundamental ability to sample minima in a high-dimensional variable space. We show how specific implementations of the main components in BH yield algorithmic realizations that attain state-of-the-art results in the context of ab initio protein structure prediction and rigid protein …",75
An efficient design of a reversible barrel shifter,"Irina Hashmi, Hafiz Md Hasan Babu",2010/1/3,Conference 2010 23rd International Conference on VLSI Design,"The key objective of today's circuit design is to increase the performance without the proportional increase in power consumption. In this regard, reversible logic has become an immensely promising technology in the field of low power computing and designing. On the other hand, data shifting and rotating are required in many operations such as arithmetic and logical operations, address decoding and indexing etc. In this consequence, barrel shifters, which can shift and rotate multiple bits in a single cycle, have become a common design choice for high speed applications. For this reason, this paper presents an efficient design of a reversible barrel shifter. It has also been shown that the new circuit outperforms the previously proposed one in terms of number of gates, number of garbage outputs, delay and quantum cost.",47
An evolutionary conservation-based method for refining and reranking protein complex structures,"Bahar Akbal-Delibas, Irina Hashmi, Amarda Shehu, Nurit Haspel",2012/6/4,Journal Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,"Detection of protein complexes and their structures is crucial for understanding their role in the basic biology of organisms. Computational docking methods can provide researchers with a good starting point for the analysis of protein complexes. However, these methods are often not accurate and their results need to be further refined to improve interface packing. In this paper, we introduce a refinement method that incorporates evolutionary information into a novel scoring function by employing Evolutionary Trace (ET)-based scores. Our method also takes Van der Waals interactions into account to avoid atomic clashes in refined structures. We tested our method on docked candidates of eight protein complexes and the results suggest that the proposed scoring function helps bias the search toward complexes with native interactions.

Guiding protein docking with geometric and evolutionary information,"Irina Hashmi, Bahar Akbal-Delibas, Nurit Haspel, Amarda Shehu",2012/6/21,Journal Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,"Structural modeling of molecular assemblies promises to improve our understanding of molecular interactions and biological function. Even when focusing on modeling structures of protein dimers from knowledge of monomeric native structure, docking two rigid structures onto one another entails exploring a large configurational space. This paper presents a novel approach for docking protein molecules and elucidating native-like configurations of protein dimers. The approach makes use of geometric hashing to focus the docking of monomeric units on geometrically complementary regions through rigid-body transformations. This geometry-based approach improves the feasibility of searching the combined configurational space.

Protein docking with information on evolutionary conserved interfaces,"Irina Hashmi, Bahar Akbal-Delibas, Nurit Haspel, Amarda Shehu",2011/11/12,Conference 2011 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshops (BIBMW),Structural modeling of molecular assemblies lies at the heart of understanding molecular interactions and biological function. We present a method for docking protein molecules and elucidating native-like structures of protein dimers. Our method is based on geometric hashing to ensure the feasibility of searching the combined conformational space of dimeric structures. The search space is narrowed by focusing the sought rigid-body transformations around surface areas with evolutionary-conserved amino-acids. Recent analysis of protein assemblies reveals that many functional interfaces are significantly conserved throughout evolution. We test our method on a broad list of sixteen diverse protein dimers and compare the structures found to have lowest lRMSD to the known native dimeric structures to those reported by other groups. Our results show that focusing the search around evolutionary-conserved …,13
A basin hopping algorithm for protein-protein docking,"Irina Hashmi, Amarda Shehu",2012/10/4,Conference 2012 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine,We present a novel probabilistic search algorithm to efficiently search the structure space of protein dimers. The algorithm is based on the basin hopping framework that repeatedly follows up structural perturbation with energy minimization to obtain a coarse-grained view of the dimeric energy surface in terms of its local minima. A Metropolis criterion biases the search towards lower-energy minima over time. Extensive analysis highlights efficient and effective implementations for the perturbation and minimization components. Testing on a broad list of dimers shows the algorithm recovers the native dimeric configuration with great accuracy and produces many minima near the native configuration. The algorithm can be employed to efficiently produce relevant decoys that can be further refined at greater detail to predict the native configuration.,12

Informatics-driven protein-protein docking,"Irina Hashmi, Amarda Shehu",2013/9/22,"Book Proceedings of the International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Biomedical Informatics","Predicting the structure of protein assemblies is fundamental to our ability to understand the molecular basis of biological function. The basic protein-protein docking problem involving two protein units docking onto each-other remains challenging. One direction of research is exploring probabilistic search algorithms with high exploration capability, but these algorithms are limited by errors in current energy functions.

idDock+: Integrating Machine Learning in Probabilistic Search for Protein–Protein Docking,"Irina Hashmi, Amarda Shehu",2015/9/1,Journal Journal of Computational Biology,"Predicting the three-dimensional native structures of protein dimers, a problem known as protein–protein docking, is key to understanding molecular interactions. Docking is a computationally challenging problem due to the diversity of interactions and the high dimensionality of the configuration space. Existing methods draw configurations systematically or at random from the configuration space. The inaccuracy of scoring functions used to evaluate drawn configurations presents additional challenges. Evidence is growing that optimization of a scoring function is an effective technique only once the drawn configuration is sufficiently similar to the native structure. Therefore, in this article we present a method that employs optimization of a sophisticated energy function, FoldX, only to locally improve a promising configuration. The main question of how promising configurations are identified is addressed through a …",5

This scarcity is due to persisting challenges in protein-protein docking. Methods based on energetic optimization have to handle vast and high-dimensional configuration spaces and inaccurate energy functions only to arrive at the wrong interface. Methods that employ learned models to replace or precede energetic evaluations are limited by the generality of these models. Computational approaches designed to be general often fail to provide realistic models on protein classes of interest in the wet laboratory.

Sampling low-energy protein-protein configurations with basin hopping,"Irina Hashmi, Amarda Shehu",2012/10/4,Conference 2012 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshops,"Here we propose a novel algorithm to efficiently generate near-native configurations of dimers. The algorithm addresses rigid protein-protein docking as an optimization problem and build upon the Basin Hopping framework to sample bound configurations that correspond to low energy local minima in the dimeric energy surface. At its core, the algorithm is driven by a geometric treatment. The unbound structures are each analyzed to represent their surfaces through a sparse set of critical points. Triangles are defined over these points to identify regions of geometric complementarity between the two monomeric structures. Alignment of two geometrically-complementary triangles results in a rigid-body transformation that bounds the two monomers to each-other, an efficient process referred to as geometric hashing.
