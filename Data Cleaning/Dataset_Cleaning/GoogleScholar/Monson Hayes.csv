The reconstruction of a multidimensional sequence from the phase or magnitude of its Fourier transform,MHMH Hayes,1982/4,"Journal IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","This paper addresses two fundamental issues involved in the reconstruction of a multidimensional sequence from either the phase or magnitude of its Fourier transform. The first issue relates to the uniqueness of a multidimensional sequence in terms of its phase or magnitude. Although phase or magnitude information alone is not sufficient, in general, to uniquely specify a sequence, a large class of sequences are shown to be recoverable from their phase or magnitude. The second issue which is addressed in this paper concerns the actual reconstruction of a multidimensional sequence from its phase or magnitude. For those sequences which are uniquely specified by their phase, several practical algorithms are described which may be used to reconstruct a sequence from its phase. Several examples of phase-only reconstruction are also presented. Unfortunately, however, even for those sequences which are …",562

Eigenface-domain super-resolution for face recognition,"Bahadir K Gunturk, Aziz Umit Batur, Yucel Altunbasak, Monson H Hayes, Russell M Mersereau",2003/6/11,Journal IEEE transactions on image processing,"Face images that are captured by surveillance cameras usually have a very low resolution, which significantly limits the performance of face recognition systems. In the past, super-resolution techniques have been proposed to increase the resolution by combining information from multiple images. These techniques use super-resolution as a preprocessing step to obtain a high-resolution image that is later passed to a face recognition system. Considering that most state-of-the-art face recognition systems use an initial dimensionality reduction method, we propose to transfer the super-resolution reconstruction from pixel domain to a lower dimensional face space. Such an approach has the advantage of a significant decrease in the computational complexity of the super-resolution reconstruction.

Exploiting human actions and object context for recognition tasks,"Darnell J Moore, Irfan A Essa, Monson H Hayes",1999/9/20,Conference Proceedings of the seventh IEEE international conference on computer vision,"Our goal is to exploit human motion and object context to perform action recognition and object classification. Towards this end, we introduce a framework for recognizing actions and objects by measuring image-, object- and action-based information from video. Hidden Markov models are combined with object context to classify hand actions, which are aggregated by a Bayesian classifier to summarize activities. We also use Bayesian methods to differentiate the class of unknown objects by evaluating detected actions along with low-level, extracted object features.

A hidden Markov model-based approach for face detection and recognition,Ara Victor Nefian,1999,Institution Georgia Institute of Technology,"The use of hidden Markov models (HMM) for faces is motivated by their partial invariance to variations in scaling and by the structure of faces. The most significant facial features of a frontal face include the hair, forehead, eyes, nose and mouth. These features occur in a natural order, from top to bottom, even if the images undergo small rotations in the image plane, and/or rotations in the plane perpendicular to the image plane. Therefore, the image of a face may be modeled using a one-dimensional HMM by assigning each of these regions to a state. The observation vectors are obtained from the DCT or KLT coefficients.",172
Convergence of iterative nonexpansive signal reconstruction algorithms,"V Tom, T Quatieri, M Hayes, J McClellan",1981/10,"Journal IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","Iterative algorithms for signal reconstruction from partial time- and frequency-domain knowledge have proven useful in a number of application areas. In this paper, a general convergence proof, applicable to a general class of such iterative reconstruction algorithms, is presented. The proof relies on the concept of a nonexpansive mapping in both the time and frequency domains. Two examples studied in detail are time-limited extrapolation (equivalently, band-limited extrapolation) and phase-only signal reconstruction. The proof of convergence for the phase-only iteration is a new result obtained by this method of proof. The generality of the approach allows the incorporation of nonlinear constraints such as time- (or space-) domain positivity or minimum and maximum value constraints. Finally, the underrelaxed form of these iterations is also shown to converge even when the solution is not guaranteed to be unique.",156

Single image-based ghost-free high dynamic range imaging using local histogram stretching and spatially-adaptive denoising,"Jaehyun Im, Jaehwan Jeon, Monson H Hayes, Joonki Paik",2011/11,Journal IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,"In this paper, we present a novel high dynamic range (HDR) imaging method using a single image. The existing multiple image-based HDR methods work only on condition that there is no camera and object movement when acquiring multiple, differently exposed low dynamic range (LDR) images. To overcome such an unrealistic restriction, we make three LDR images from a single input image using local histogram stretching. An edge-preserving spatially adaptive denoising method is also proposed to suppress the noise that is amplified in the histogram stretching process. Because the proposed method self-generates three histogram-stretched LDR images from a single input image, ghost artifacts that are the result of the relative motion between the camera and objects during exposure time, are inherently removed.

Multifocusing and depth estimation using a color shift model-based computational camera,"Sangjin Kim, Eunsung Lee, Monson H Hayes, Joonki Paik",2012/6/7,Journal IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,"This paper presents a novel approach to depth estimation using a multiple color-filter aperture (MCA) camera and its application to multifocusing. An image acquired by the MCA camera contains spatially varying misalignment among RGB color channels, where the direction and length of the misalignment is a function of the distance of an object from the plane of focus. Therefore, if the misalignment is estimated from the MCA output image, multifocusing and depth estimation become possible using a set of image processing algorithms. We first segment the image into multiple clusters having approximately uniform misalignment using a color-based region classification method, and then find a rectangular region that encloses each cluster.

This final step of display realism can be achieved by stereoscopic techniques with the use of multi-view image sequences.

The Unique Reconstruction of Multidimensional Sequences from Fourier Transform Magnitude or Phase,M.H. Hayes,1986,Journal Image Recovery: Theory and Application,"This chapter is concerned with the problem of recovering a signal given partial information about its Fourier transform. Although there is a one-to-one correspondence between a signal and its Fourier transform, there are many applications in which some of the Fourier domain information is either degraded or missing. In order to restore the signal, therefore, it is desirable to either restore or recover the missing spectral information. The primary problem of concern in this chapter is recovery of the phase of the Fourier transform given the magnitude and recovery of the Fourier transform magnitude given the phase. Clearly, in the absence of any underlying signal model or constraints, the loss of either phase or magnitude information of a complex function is irreversible. What is surprising, however, is that under some fairly general conditions it is possible to recover a signal from the phase of its Fourier transform or from its magnitude. In fact, for a useful class of signals it is almost always possible to recover one from the other; ie, the phase and the magnitude constitute redundant pieces of information. The emphasis in this chapter will be on the uniqueness question. In other words, we will be concerned with the conditions (signal constraints) which",40

SPT is an orthogonal basis approach. It combines block-based disparity estimation with two-dimensional first order approximation. For the regions where disparity estimation fails, such as occlusion regions, first order approximation provides a decent estimate.

Eigenface-based super-resolution for face recognition,"Bahadir K Gunturk, Aziz Umit Batur, Yucel Altunbasak, MH Hayes, Russell M Mersereau",2002/9/22,Conference Proceedings. International Conference on Image Processing,"Face images that are captured by surveillance cameras usually have a very low resolution, which significantly limits the performance of face recognition systems. In the past, super-resolution techniques have been proposed that attempt to increase the resolution by combining information from multiple images. These techniques use super-resolution as a preprocessing system to obtain a high resolution image that can later be passed to a face recognition system. Considering that most state-of-the-art face recognition systems use an initial dimensionality reduction method, we propose embedding the super-resolution algorithm into the face recognition system so that super-resolution is not performed in the pixel domain, but is instead performed in a reduced dimensional domain. The advantage of such an approach is a significant decrease in the computational complexity of the super-resolution algorithm because the …",31

Iterative enhancement of noncoherent radar data,"M Richards, C Morris, M Hayes",1986/4/7,"Conference ICASSP'86. IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","In this paper, the application of a constrained iterative deconvolution algorithm to the problem of enhancing noncoherent radar data is described. It is shown that noncoherent reconstruction is theoretically not unique. Despite this, an approximate convolutional model of the observed data is established and it is seen that reasonable results are observed. A key feature of the algorithm is the use of a median filter and threshold to segment the data into two classes, potential point targets and background, which are deconvolved separately subject to different nonlinear constraints. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated using real air-to-ground millimeter-wave noncoherent radar data.",14
Three-dimensional pose estimation for laboratory mouse from monocular images,"Ghadi Salem, Jonathan Krynitsky, Monson Hayes, Thomas Pohida, Xavier Burgos-Artizzu",2019/3/31,Journal IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,"Video-based activity and behavior analysis of mice has garnered wide attention in biomedical research. Animal facilities hold large numbers of mice housed in “home-cages” densely stored within ventilated racks. Automated analysis of mice activity in their home-cages can provide a new set of sensitive measures for detecting abnormalities and time-resolved deviation from the baseline behavior. Large-scale monitoring in animal facilities requires minimal footprint hardware that integrates seamlessly with the ventilated racks. The compactness of hardware imposes the use of fisheye lenses positioned in close proximity to the cage.

Modified levenshtein distance for real-time gesture recognition,"Clementine Nyirarugira, Hyo-Rim Choi, JunYoung Kim, Monson Hayes, TaeYong Kim",2013/12/16,Conference 2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP),"In this paper, a real time dynamic gesture recognition method based on a modified Levenshtein distance is proposed. The method addresses the issues faced in dynamic gesture recognition methods that are due to gesture variability within the class due to differences in the gesture speed. Since the gesture speed and duration will vary from one gesture to another, or from one person to the next, without taking this variability into account there will be an increase in the number of recognition errors. Here, we use a modified Levenshtein distance to represent each gesture class by one gesture exemplar and no restrictions on the gesture speed is necessary. Experiments demonstrate real-time gesture recognition rates of 93.9% for gestures of variable speed.",13

AAM combines a subspace-based deformable model of an object's appearance with a fast and robust method of fitting this model to a previously unseen image. The speed of this algorithm comes from the assumption that the gradient matrix is fixed around the optimal coefficients for all images. In this paper, we propose a convergence scheme for AAM that adapts this gradient matrix to the target image's texture during convergence by adding linear modes of change that are based on the texture eigenvectors of AAM. We show that this adaptive strategy for the gradient matrix provides a significant increase in the performance of the AAM algorithm.",12

Block Toeplitz approximation,"DM Wilkes, MH Hayes",1988/10/1,Journal Signal Processing,"In this paper the two-dimensional harmonic retrieval problem is addressed by extending a high resolution one-dimensional technique, the Iterated Toeplitz Approximation Method (ITAM), to the two-dimensional problem.

We have developed a presentation development system called inFusion that makes it possible to create online presentations almost instantly. Lecturers use a very simple interface (below, right) to synchronize graphics, video and audio into a coherent presentation viewable in any browser, as shown below. These lecture modules consist of multiple synchronized media types. A typical application is synchronization of still slides with a talking head. However, media can also include animations, audio, multiple video clips, multiple synchronized still images, and text. The presentation format is flexible, allowing the presenter to change backgrounds, the elements included, and the layout. This flexibility allows an instructor to tailor presentations to his teaching style, the learning style of his students, and the material. Any of the media windows can be made “hot,” with links to supplementary material, readings, or other lectures. These links can change as the presentation progresses, allowing the creation of context-sensitive links to additional material. The primary advantages of inFusion are simplicity and portability. Although many of the Internet courses we have produced at Georgia Tech have been filmed in a small studio, instructors can also capture lectures in the classroom, in their own office, or at home. A portable production system can consist of as little as a laptop and a USB camera. Instructors, even with little or no previous experience with inFusion, can create effective and engaging …",5

To address this problem, this paper introduces a deep learning-based authentication approach to learn and track the variations of channel characteristics, and thus improving the adaptability and convergence of the physical layer authentication. Specifically, an intelligent detection framework based on a Convolutional-Long Short-Term Memory (Convolutional-LSTM) network is designed to deal with channel differences without knowing the statistical properties of the channel.

IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing",At the ICASSP'86 conference in Tokyo we introduced a new efficient ARMA lattice structure that is fully consistent with the geometrical characteristics of the AR and MA lattice structures in that it is realized in terms of a fully orthogonal set of lattice vectors and it evaluates all optimal ARMA filters of lower order than a given maximum order.

A novel data-adaptive power spectrum estimation technique,"D Thomas, M Hayes",1987/4/6,"Conference ICASSP'87. IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","In this paper a novel data adaptive power spectrum estimation procedure is introduced. This estimate, called PSEUDA for Power Spectrum Estimation Using Data Adaptation, unifies under one conceptual framework the Autoregressive or Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) and the Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM) by providing a method which is continuosly variable between these two extremes For small bandwidths the results obtained are similar to the Data Adaptive Spectral Estimate (DASE) introduced by Davis and Regier [4]. Unlike DASE, a fast algorithm has been developed for the PSEUDA estimate. This algorithm consist of three parts: 1) a Levinsion recursion, 2) a weighted correlation of the prediction error coefficients obtained in step one, and 3) the use of an FFT to calculate the estimate of the spectrum.",2
Procedures for signal reconstruction from noisy phase,"D Thomas, M Hayes",1984/3/19,"Conference ICASSP'84. IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing",In this paper a class of iterative procedures is presented for reconstructing a finite duration sequence from noisy samples of its Fourier transform phase. These measurements are combined with a knowledge of the true transform magnitude and/or hard constraints on the phase noise variations to define sets whose intersection must contain the true sequence. The algorithms iterate between the sequence domain and the transform domain applying the known constraints (i.e. finite duration and known limits on phase variation) in each domain. Results of an experimental investigation are presented. A method is described for the case where limits on both the magnitude and phase variation of a finite length sequence are known.,2
Artificial intelligence applied to spectrum estimation,"J Gaby, M Hayes",1984/3/19,"Conference ICASSP'84.

While power spectrum estimation is a problem which falls within the domain of signal processing, the problem of inferring information falls within the domain of artificial intelligence (AI). With a wide variety of different types of power spectrum estimation techniques to choose from, an equally wide range of differing spectral estimates may be produced. Each estimate, however, may be used to infer information about the time series. By defining an appropriate knowledge base, a system is being developed to infer information from power spectrum estimates. This system combines the estimates produced by a variety of current spectrum estimation techniques in order to formulate a composite spectral estimate.",2

The modulation property of a general complex exponential for the z-transform is extended to the lattice filter with a systematic modification of the reflection coefficients of the filter. A reciprocal-based lattice filter is derived. It has the structure of a standard lattice filter yet the zeros of the system function depend explicitly on the weighting functions of the filter. This filter has the property that the system function roots remain fixed as additional sections are added to the filter.< >",1
Iterative harmonic de composition of nonstationary random processes: Theory and application to spectral line tracking,"MH Hayes, DM Wilkes, MA Clements",1985,Journal Proceedings of IMA Conference on Mathematics in Signal Processing,"The harmonic decomposition of a random process into a sum of sinusoids in white noise is an important problem with applications in a number of different areas. As a result of the work of VF Pisarenko, it has been shown that the sinusoidal frequencies and the white noise power are determined by the minimum eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of the autocorrelation matrix. In this paper, a new iterative approach for performing the harmonic decomposition is presented. This solution is based on the Levinson recursion and uses the reflection coefficients to determine convergence. The iterative harmonic decomposition is then applied to the spectral line tracking problem. Unlike other adaptive algorithms, this method gives good tracking performance in only 2 or 3 iterations with computational requirements comparable to those of the adaptive algorithms which makes it viable for implementation in real time. Simulation examples using stationary and nonstationary data are given and the performance of the iterative solution is compared to several adaptive methods.",1

Proceedings 16","One of the difficult challenges in face recognition is dealing with the illumination variations that occur in varying environments. A practical and efficient way to address harsh illumination variations is to use active image differencing in near-infrared frequency range. In this method, two types of image frames are taken: an illuminated frame is taken with near infrared illumination, and an ambient frame is taken without the illumination. The difference between face regions of these frames reveals the face image illuminated only by the illumination. Therefore the image is not affected by the ambient illumination and illumination robust face recognition can be achieved. But the method assumes that there is no motion between two frames. Faces in different locations on the two frames introduces a motion artifact. To compensate for motion between two frames, a motion interpolation method has been proposed; but it …",

The proposed regularized SR algorithm incorporates two constraints enforcing (i) disconnected edges to be reconnected and (ii) orientation-adaptive regularization. By combining two constraints in the regularization framework, the proposed SR algorithm can significantly reduce aliasing artifacts and, as a result, produce edge-preserved high-resolution (HR) images. In addition to the formulation of the regularized SR algorithm with hybrid constraints, experimental results show that the proposed SR algorithm improves peak-to-peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed HR images by up to 5[dB]over existing state-of-the-art SR methods.",
Modified Particle Filtering for Unstable Handheld Camera-Based Object Tracking,"Seungwon Lee, Monson H Hayes, Joonki Paik",2012,Journal IEIE Transactions on Smart Processing and Computing,"In this paper, we address the tracking problem caused by camera motion and rolling shutter effects associated with CMOS sensors in consumer handheld cameras, such as mobile cameras, digital cameras, and digital camcorders. A modified particle filtering method is proposed for simultaneously tracking objects and compensating for the effects of camera motion. The proposed method uses an elastic registration algorithm (ER) that considers the global affine motion as well as the brightness and contrast between images, assuming that camera motion results in an affine transform of the image between two successive frames. By assuming that the camera motion is modeled globally by an affine transform, only the global affine model instead of the local model was considered. Only the brightness parameter was used in intensity variation. The contrast parameters used in the original ER algorithm were ignored because the change in illumination is small enough between temporally adjacent frames. The proposed particle filtering consists of the following four steps:(i) prediction step,(ii) compensating prediction state error based on camera motion estimation,(iii) update step and (iv) re-sampling step. A larger number of particles are needed when camera motion generates a prediction state error of an object at the prediction step. The proposed method robustly tracks the object of interest by compensating for the prediction state error using the affine motion model estimated from ER. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional particle filter, and can track moving objects robustly in consumer handheld imaging …",

The method eliminates the constraint on subarray spacing and the need for a search procedure inherent in most 2-D eigenanalysis techniques, and does not require pairing of angles.< >",
Phase retrieval using a window function,"Wooshik Kim, Monson H Hayes",1993/3,Journal IEEE transactions on signal processing,"The problem considered is that of reconstructing a signal from the Fourier intensity of the signal and the Fourier intensities of two windowed signals: one by a window w(n) and the other by its complementary window (1-w(n)). Several conditions are developed under which a signal can be uniquely specified to within several trivial ambiguities such as sign, translation, and time reversal from the given conditions. A possible reconstruction algorithm derived from the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is presented.< >",20
Detecting changes in process monitoring signals,"W Armin Kittel, Monson H Hayes",1992,Journal submitted for publication in ASME Journal Engineering for Industry,"This paper addresses the problem of automatic monitoring of process signals. A syntactic approach to the signal representation is chosen leading to several advantages which are especially appealing for process monitoring applications. The paper introduces a generalized symbol alphabet capturing the physical appearance of process monitoring signals. The signals are decomposed into simpler subcomponents described by different parametric models and combined under an object-oriented hybrid signal representation. A set of subcomponents is modeled by a piecewise spline function approximation, which can be viewed as an extension of syntactic signal modeling approaches used in electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. A corresponding grammar based on linguistic variables as defined in fuzzy set theory allows the signal abstraction necessary for signal understanding tasks. Furthermore, a robust event-synchronous system capable of transcribing given signals into the proposed symbolic representation is described. Finally, a concrete example using a pump monitoring application is given to show the applicability of the system.",

Improved pel-recursive motion estimation algorithms,"S Liu, M Hayes, N Faust",1990/4/1,Conference IEEE Proceedings on Southeastcon,"The pel-recursive approach to motion estimation is studied. Two algorithms that model the spatial gradient as an estimate plus noise are derived. The first algorithm deals with the usual two-frame case, except that damping terms are introduced in the gradient covariance matrix. Simulations show that this algorithm is stable enough that no restriction on the maximum allowable updating step size is required. The second algorithm is an extension of the first algorithm to the general multiframe case. The algorithms are tested and compared using synthetic and real video sequences, and it is shown that using more than two frames simultaneously can track motion more accurately in noisy environments.< >",
Phase Retrieval Using Two Fourier Intensities,"Wooshik Kim, Monson H Hayes",1989/6/14,Conference Signal Recovery and Synthesis,"The two-dimensional discrete phase-retrieval problem is concerned with the reconstruction of a signal, or image, x (m, n), from the magnitude (intensity) of its Fourier transform,| X (ω 1, ω 2)|-Phase retrieval is an important problem that arises in a variety of different applications including x-ray crystallography, astronomy, electron microscopy, optics, and signal processing [1-5]. There are three issues that need to be considered in the solution of the phase retrieval problem: the uniqueness of the solution, the development of phase retrieval algorithms that reconstruct a signal from its Fourier transform intensity and any á priori information that might be available, and the sensitivity of the reconstruction to computational noise and measurements errors. It is now well known that if a two-dimensional signal with finite support has a z-transform that is an irreducible polynomial then the signal is uniquely defined to within a trivial …",
Fourier Transform Magnitude or Phase,Monson H Hayes,1987,Journal Image Recovery--theory and Application,"This chapter is concerned with the problem of recovering a signal given partial information about its Fourier transform. Although there is a one-to-one correspondence between a signal and its Fourier transform, there are many applications in which some of the Fourier domain information is either degraded or missing. In order to restore the signal, therefore, it is desirable to either restore or recover the missing spectral information. The primary problem of concern in this chapter is recovery of the phase of the Fourier transform given the magnitude and recovery of the Fourier transform magnitude given the phase. Clearly, in the absence of any underlying signal model or constraints, the loss of either phase or magnitude information of a complex function is irreversible. What is surprising, however, is that under some fairly general conditions it is possible to recover a signal from the phase of its Fourier transform or from its magnitude. In fact, for a useful class of signals it is almost always possible to recover one from the other; ie, the phase and the magnitude constitute redundant pieces of information.",

A survey of methods for iterative signal restoration,"RM Mersereau, MH Hayes, RW Schafer",1982,"Journal ICC'82-The Digital Revolution, Volume 2","The restoration of a distorted signal, and the closely related problem of recovering a signal from partial information, are crucial problems in signal processing. Attention is presently given to iterative algorithms applicable to signal restoration. The examples given illustrate that by incorporating a priori knowledge of the desired signal, impressive results are obtainable in problems for which direct, noniterative restorations are difficult to obtain. It is noted that although the constrained iterative technique is promising in many applications, much work remains to be done on such aspects of the method as convergence rates, noise effects, and the effects of errors in the modeling of distortions, as well as on the application of constraints.",
The Uniqueness of a Multi-Dimensional Sequence in Terms of Its Phase or Magnitude.,Monson H Hayes,1980/12/11,Publisher MASSACHUSETTS INST OF TECH LEXINGTON LINCOLN LAB,"A multi-dimensional sequence is not, in general, uniquely defined in terms of only the phase or magnitude of its Fourier transform. However, in this paper some conditions are developed under which a multi-dimensional sequence is uniquely defined by its phase. A similar set of conditions are then developed for the unique specification of a multi-dimensional sequence in terms of its Fourier transform magnitude. In both cases, it is initially assumed that either the phase or magnitude is known for all frequencies. The results are then generalized to the case in which the phase or magnitude is known only for a finite set of frequency values. Author",

These conditions are distinctly different from the minimum or maximum phase requirement and are applicable to both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional sequences.

First, in order for faculty to become involved in the development of “on-line” courses, the production process must be easy and convenient, which is generally not the case.
