Lean construction: From theory to implementation,"Ossama Salem, J Solomon, A Genaidy, I Minkarah",2006/10,Journal Journal of management in engineering,"This article compares the techniques developed for lean construction with those developed for lean manufacturing. Lean manufacturing and lean construction techniques share many common elements despite the obvious differences in their assembly environments and processes. Manufacturing plants and construction sites are different in many ways that might explain why lean production theories and practices do not fully fit the construction industry. Though many lean construction tools and elements are still in an embryonic state, lean construction techniques are gaining popularity because they can affect the bottom line of projects. Additionally, this paper presents a study of a construction project in which specific lean construction elements were tested. Each technique was evaluated in terms of its impact on the performance of the project. Based on the findings of the study, a new “lean assessment tool” is …",568

Site implementation and assessment of lean construction techniques,"O Salem, J Solomon, A Genaidy, M Luegring",2005/10/1,Journal Lean construction journal,"The goal of this paper is to test the effectiveness of some lean construction tools, in particular, those tools that can be applied in medium size construction firms. Due to the success of the lean production system in manufacturing, the construction industry has adapted lean techniques to eliminate waste and increase profit. A field study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of some lean construction techniques including last planner, increased visualization, daily huddle meetings, first run studies, the 5s process, and fail safe for quality. The data collection methods included direct observations, interviews, questionnaires, and documentary analysis. The effectiveness of the lean construction tools was evaluated through the lean implementation measurement standard and performance criteria. It was found that last planner, increased visualization, daily huddle meetings, and first run studies achieved more effective outcomes than expected. However, the results of implementation of 5s process and fail safe for quality did not meet the expectations of the tool champions and the research team. It was found that there is need for behavioral changes and training for effective use of lean tools. Most of the lean construction tools selected for the project are either ready to use, or are recommended with some modifications. A summary of the results is provided, and future research needs are outlined.",295
Risk-based life-cycle costing of infrastructure rehabilitation and construction alternatives,"Ossama Salem, Simaan AbouRizk, Samuel Ariaratnam",2003/3,Journal Journal of Infrastructure Systems,"Infrastructure engineers and managers have to be aware of the economical consequences of selecting a particular rehabilitation and construction alternative for civil infrastructure units such as pavements, bridges, and pipelines.

Moving from lean manufacturing to lean construction: Toward a common sociotechnological framework,"Omar Paez, Sam Salem, Julie Solomon, Ash Genaidy",2005/3,Journal Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing & Service Industries,"Since the early 1990s, the construction industry has taken some interest in the application of lean production to its own case. A new body of research led by the International Group for Lean Construction (IGLC) has been exploring new techniques for the industry. In this article the techniques developed for lean construction are compared with those of lean manufacturing. Differences between the manufacturing and the construction cases showed why lean production does not fully suit the construction industry. Although some elements are in an embryonic state, lean construction has built a set of techniques that are transferable to any constructor. Lean manufacturing and lean construction share many common elements despite their different techniques. The need for a joint combination of technical and human elements shows that both approaches conform to a common sociotechnological design. © 2005 Wiley …",119

Risk assessment of wastewater collection lines using failure models and criticality ratings,"Baris Salman, Ossama Salem",2012/8/1,Journal Journal of pipeline systems engineering and practice,"Because of deteriorating condition levels of wastewater networks and financial constraints, sewer agencies are seeking methods to prioritize inspection of sewer pipes on the basis of risk of failure. Risk assessment of sewer pipes requires integration of the probability and consequences-of-failure values in a way that reflects the decision maker’s perception of risk. This paper presents the use of a weighted scoring method to determine criticality of sewer pipelines. The procedure involves identifying important factors, determining the relative importance of the selected factors, and summarizing the overall performance of sewer pipes in terms of these factors. Determination of risk of failure by combining the resultant consequence-of-failure values with the probability-of-failure values using simple multiplication, risk matrices, and fuzzy inference systems is presented.

Minimizing cutting wastes of reinforcement steel bars using genetic algorithms and integer programming models,"O Salem, A Shahin, Y Khalifa",2007/12,Journal Journal of construction engineering and management,"Materials that are in the form of one-dimensional stocks such as steel rebars, structural steel sections, and dimensional lumber generate a major fraction of the generated construction waste. Cutting one-dimensional stocks to suit the construction project requirements result in trim or cutting losses, which is the major cause of the one-dimensional construction waste. The optimization problem of minimizing the trim losses is known as the cutting stock problem (CSP). In this paper, three approaches for solving the one-dimensional cutting stock problem are presented. A genetic algorithm (GA) model, a linear programming (LP) model, and an integer programming (IP) model were developed to solve the one-dimensional CSP.

An asset management approach for drainage infrastructure and culverts,Mohammad Najafi,2008,"Publisher Midwest Regional University Transportation Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison","Drainage infrastructure systems (culvert, storm sewer, outfall and related drainage elements) are mostly buried underground and are in need of special attention in terms of proactive/preventive asset management strategy. Drainage infrastructure systems represent an integral portion of roadway assets that routinely require inspection, maintenance, repair and renewal. Further challenges are the wide geospatial distribution of these infrastructure assets and environmental exposure. There has been considerable research conducted on culverts, but mostly looked at the problem from a traditional structural/geotechnical perspective. Asset management procedures for culverts and drainage infrastructure systems are complex issues, and can benefit a great deal from an optimal asset management program that draws from programs pertaining to buried pipes. The first and most important step in an asset management initiative is the establishment of mechanism for asset inventory and asset conditions in a format compatible with the routine procedures of field operators and inspectors. The first objective of this research project was to develop field protocols and operational business rules for inventory data collection and management and inspection of drainage infrastructures in terms of types of data to be collected, frequency of inspection, and analysis and reporting mechanisms. After review of these protocols by the project oversight committee, a pilot study was conducted to verify efficiency of their implementation.

Lean techniques in the management of the design of an industrial project,"Abhijeet S Deshpande, Larry E Filson, Ossama M Salem, Richard A Miller",2012/4/1,Journal Journal of management in engineering,"Lean production techniques developed by Toyota Motor Corporation have been widely applied in the manufacturing sector to reduce waste, ensure just-in-time delivery, create effective value streams, and ensure continuous improvement. Over the last two decades, significant efforts have been made to develop the theoretical foundation and practical tools to implement these techniques in the construction process. The construction process is similar to production, in that it involves the assembly of raw materials into a product. The design process, on the other hand, involves conversion of the client’s requirements into manufacturing instructions using creativity and technical knowledge. This makes it challenging to implement the principles of lean production directly to design.

These impacts can be minimized by implementing lean construction strategies that focus on reducing wastes and improving performance, as well as increasing the overall value of the facility to the end users. The objective of this study is to identify the adverse effects of work-zones activities for pavement projects, and demonstrate how lean construction techniques can provide sustainable solutions. For example, 5S’s can help reducing the waste which is a cause of environmental degradation. The last planner technique can be used to prevent schedule delays and to accelerate the construction process, and assist in reducing the excess emissions due to unstable traffic around the work-zones and from heavy equipment. It can also minimize vehicle operating costs due to congestion and improve the mobility of work-zone. Increased visualization approaches such as speed advisories, delay advisories; regulatory speed limit changes merge control and alternate route guidance, can further enhance safety and mobility. Other impacts such as noise pollution; and reduced accessibility to businesses and emergency facilities can be minimized using phased scheduling which allows the selection of construction time and duration suitable for the surrounding community.",34

User costs in pavement construction and rehabilitation alternative evaluation,"OM Salem, AS Deshpande, A Genaidy, TG Geara",2013/3/1,Journal Structure and Infrastructure Engineering,"The decision-making processes used by many state transportation agencies in US and Canada for selecting a strategy for pavement rehabilitation primarily depend on initial construction and maintenance costs for identifying the most economically efficient pavement rehabilitation alternative.

Accelerating construction of roadway bridges using alternative techniques and procurement methods,"Ossama Salem, Baris Salman, Sudipta Ghorai",2018/1/26,Journal Transport,"Approximately a quarter of the bridges in the United States are classified as either functionally obsolete or structurally deficient by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT). As such, transportation agencies are challenged to handle the increasing need of upgrades with limited resources. Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) can reduce the construction duration and can decrease the environmental and socio-economic impacts of repair and upgrade activities by minimizing traffic disruptions. As several states are using accelerated construction techniques, a standard guideline would be highly beneficial for these agencies in developing or improving the ABC decision-making process. As problems are often project specific, a decision tool can assist in determining the viability of ABC over traditional construction methods and in selecting appropriate construction and contracting strategies on a case-by-case basis. This paper presents findings of a recent survey with regards to utilization of ABC strategies by state Departments of Transportation (DOTs), and a decision support framework which consists of three models:(1) Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) based ABC vs. traditional construction decision-making model;(2) ABC alternatives selection model; and (3) procurement method and contract selection model. The paper also discusses the use of ABC in New York State and describes a New York State bridge project to validate the AHP model.",16

Infrastructure construction and rehabilitation: risk-based life cycle cost analysis,Ossama M Salem,2000,Pages 4110-4110,"The objective of this research is to provide a prediction model of life cycle costs for civil infrastructure construction and rehabilitation alternatives, taking into consideration the uncertainty involved in determining the service life of civil infrastructure units. The ability to determine the uncertainty values that accompany the predicted life-cycle costs allows decision-makers to select construction and rehabilitation alternatives with a knowledge of the inherent risks. This research utilizes a risk-based approach to predict probabilities of occurrence of total life cycle costs associated with the construction/rehabilitation of civil infrastructure unit. The uncertainty component of the model is introduced through the statistical probability distributions that represent the times-to-failure (ie, service life) of infrastructure units. In the developed risk-based life cycle cost model, the service life of each construction/rehabilitation alternative is input to the model using random variables sampled from the fitted statistical distributions that represent the service life of the infrastructure units. Computer simulation is used to generate the probability distribution of the model outcome (ie, life cycle costs of construction alternatives). The resulting life cycle cost distribution is then statistically analyzed to provide a measure of risk. As aresult, decision-makers can determine the probabilities associated with various values of total life cycle costs. This enables them to make informed decisions regarding the construction/rehabilitation alternative that can be applied and the level of risk they wish to accept.

A decision support framework for accelerated bridge construction,"Ossama Salem, Sudipta Ghorai, Baris Salman, Riyad Aboutaha",2014,Source Transportation Research Board 93rd Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"Functional obsolescence and structural deficiencies of highway bridges are creating challenges for commuters and transportation agencies throughout the United States. Recently, the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) classified approximately 13.9% of the bridges in the United States as functionally obsolete and 11% as structurally deficient. As a result of increasing needs associated with upgrades and repairs, the decision makers are urged to determine the best use of limited resources. Accelerated bridge construction (ABC) can reduce the downtime of highway bridges and can decrease the environmental and socio-economic impacts by minimizing traffic disruptions due to bridge repair and upgrade activities. As several states are using accelerated construction techniques, a standardized guideline would be highly beneficial for these agencies in developing or improving their ABC decision-making processes. Most often, problems faced are project specific, which makes it challenging to choose among various repair and rehabilitation alternatives. A decision tool is, therefore, necessary to determine the viability of ABC over traditional construction methods and also to select appropriate construction and contracting strategies on a case by case basis. This paper presents the results of a literature review on ABC methods, and contracting alternatives; and a decision support framework that provides a systems approach to ABC. The framework consists of three models: a) Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) based ABC vs. Traditional Construction decision making model; b) ABC alternatives selection model; and c) Procurement method and …",3

Analysis of Accidents and Injuries of Construction Equipment Operators,Ashwini M Bhide,2006,Institution University of Cincinnati,"Background-Safety continues to be one of the toughest challenges of the construction industry. The construction equipment operators referred here as heavy equipment operators are the class that operates a variety of heavy construction equipment. They perform diverse tasks and hence have the potential to be exposed to different types of injuries. Objective-To analyze the previous occurrences of accidents recorded by OSHA and verify the causation factors by means of a field study. The second objective is to check if the observed group is ergonomically safe. Method-OSHA has maintained a systematic record of accidents of equipment operators in the IMIS database (Integrated Management Information Systems) in the form of short summaries. The accident summaries are compiled and graphs are plotted to establish specific patterns in the occurrences of accidents. A group of construction equipment operators was observed on a construction site with the help of a checklist and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) template to identify the accident causing practices followed and check if the amount of physical load imposed is within allowable range as stated by RULA tables. Results-The analysis showed that more than 50% accidents are a result of human error. The other causation factors observed were environmental interference, equipment breakdown and failure to comply with safety standards by the employer.

In their relations with the employers and clients, the Professional Engineers shall act in professional manners as faithful agents or trustees for each employer or client. However, in this practice, the engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty, integrity, fairness and impartiality in protecting the public health and safety in delivering professional services. To that end, engineers must perform their professional duties in compliance with the highest principles of ethical conduct. The Civil Engineering graduates, through their careers, will be involved in working in teams or managing projects where decision making will often be an inevitable part of their responsibilities. Therefore, there is an emerging need within the engineering education curricula across the nation for developing ethical decision making frameworks and to place an emphasis on theories and canons of professional ethics and the stakeholder models in conjunction or often beyond the technical teachings and competency development objectives.

An asset management approach for drainage infrastructure and culverts,Mohammad Najafi,2008,"Publisher Midwest Regional University Transportation Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison","Drainage infrastructure systems (culvert, storm sewer, outfall and related drainage elements) are mostly buried underground and are in need of special attention in terms of proactive/preventive asset management strategy. Drainage infrastructure systems represent an integral portion of roadway assets that routinely require inspection, maintenance, repair and renewal. Further challenges are the wide geospatial distribution of these infrastructure assets and environmental exposure. There has been considerable research conducted on culverts, but mostly looked at the problem from a traditional structural/geotechnical perspective. Asset management procedures for culverts and drainage infrastructure systems are complex issues, and can benefit a great deal from an optimal asset management program that draws from programs pertaining to buried pipes. The first and most important step in an asset management initiative is the establishment of mechanism for asset inventory and asset conditions in a format compatible with the routine procedures of field operators and inspectors. The first objective of this research project was to develop field protocols and operational business rules for inventory data collection and management and inspection of drainage infrastructures in terms of types of data to be collected, frequency of inspection, and analysis and reporting mechanisms. After review of these protocols by the project oversight committee, a pilot study was conducted to verify efficiency of their implementation.

Accelerated Construction of Bridges: The Path Toward a Holistic Decision-Making System,"O Salem, Richard Alan Miller, Abhijeet Deshpande, Tejas Arurkar",2007,Source Transportation Research Board 86th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"Approximately 28% of the 590,000 bridges in US need to be rehabilitated or replaced in the near future. Unless timely corrective action is taken, the social, environmental and economic costs associated with a declining infrastructure system are likely to be enormous. This mission is especially challenging because it must be achieved under heavy and escalating traffic conditions and using limited funds. The FHWA is promoting the philosophy of accelerated construction of bridges in order to mitigate the impact of reconstruction on the flow of traffic and to enhance quality of work and safety. Accelerated Construction has been performed in some high profile marquee projects, but it has not become the standard operating practice yet. Due to severe funding constraints, most state DOTs use initial cost as a primary factor in determining the technique for construction. This paper presents the background work done in a research study to develop a holistic decision making system based on a wide array of contributing factors. A comprehensive overview of the need for accelerated construction of bridges is presented. A review of decision making systems for bridge construction, found in research literature is presented and finally the results of a survey of state highway authorities in US and Canada detailing the state of the art of use of accelerated construction of bridges and factors considered while making decision are presented. The elements of a better decision making system such as cost, flow of traffic, safety, impact on local communities etc. are presented.",1
Accelerated construction decision-making process for bridges,"Richard Miller, Sam Salem",2006,Publisher Midwest Regional University Transportation Center,"The decision making process for selecting appropriate construction plan for rehabilitation/reconstruction of bridges involves evaluating plans for their performance on qualitative and quantitative metrics. The decision maker has to decide the relative importance of various criteria in the decision making process. The qualitative nature of some of the criteria such as mitigation of impact on communities, businesses, environment, ensuring safety of stakeholders makes it difficult to establish a transparent decision making process. It is sometimes difficult for the decision-maker to justify extra expenditure for accelerating construction to achieve these non-quantifiable objectives. The decision making process developed in this research study is based on Analytical Hierarchy Process. It provides the decision maker with a tool to transparently extract quantitative weights which reflect the relative importance of both qualitative and quantitative criteria in the decision making process. It also enables the decision maker to evaluate various alternative construction strategies for their performance in meeting these qualitative and quantitative criteria.",1
Performance Tracking through the Work Compatibility Visual Tool,OMAR ROLANDO PAEZ,2004,Institution University of Cincinnati,"Objective: This study proposes a decision-support framework to track the state of the human-at-work system on an operational basis. The work compatibility model provides a multi-dimensional diagnostic of the human-at-work system. By integrating the work compatibility model into a visual framework, management can make informative decisions that contribute to the improvement of human performance Background: Examples of multidimensional models can be found in performance measuring systems and human performance measures. Performance measuring systems, either hierarchical or balanced models, are focused on the reduction of operational variables to financial performance. Human performance measures rely on respondents to weigh different factors and define the best rules for aggregation. In the work compatibility model, respondents rate work-factors as energizers and demands on the system. An expert model uses a matrix function to quantify the degree of compatibility. Based on the matrix output, operating zones determine how far the system is from the optimum performance. Conceptual model: The matrix function of the expert solution is transformed into a plane with two regions set along the compatibility line. Work factors are aggregated into two vectors, one on each region of the plane, and the resultant of the two vectors provides two indexes: the yield ratio, a relative measure of the magnitude of vector, and the efficiency ratio, a relative measure of the angle between the two vectors. A Visual Basic application is developed to implement the proposed quantitative methods. The continuous model is tested with data from a …",1
Infrastructure management: Decision support and life cycle cost analysis,"Ossama M Salem, Samuel Ariaratnam",1999,Conference Canadian Society for Civil Engineering-1999 Annual Conference,"The continuous budget cuts and restructuring in many of today's governments trigger the need for optimally allocating budgets and resources to ensure long term value. This involves repairing infrastructures where they can be repaired, and replacing and expanding infrastructures as necessary in an optimum manner. An Infrastructure Management System (IMS) can play an important role in optimizing and justifying budget spending. Generally, the main objectives of IMS are to: I) provide access to infrastructure information through an integrated data repository and 2) prioritize maintenance, rehabilitation and construction needs and optimize spending to ensure life cycle maximum value. This paper consists of two main parts. The first part outlines the research and development efforts in Alberta, Canada for its transportation Infrastructure Management System. It presents the issues behind this major initiative along with the scope, architecture and components of the system. The second part discusses the issue of life cycle cost analysis and its application in infrastructure management. This includes the evaluation of infrastructure construction and rehabilitation alternatives, taking into considerations the uncertainty involved in determining the useful life of an infrastructure. The ability to determine the uncertainty values, which accompany the predicted life cycle costs, allows decision-makers to evaluate construction and rehabilitation alternatives with a good knowledge of the inherent risks.",1

Using historical data available from ready mix plants, an attempt was made to demonstrate the new mix design concept using as many variables as possible. Linear programming was selected to implement the optimization model using the LINDO optimization package. A prototype was developed and demonstrated a superior capabilities in meeting required specifications and recommending optimum mix ratios. It also showed that significant cost savings could be achieved by implementing the proposed model. Accordingly, a full-scale system was developed and tested. The developed system proved to have the capability to determine the optimum concrete mix design based on client's specifications, job requirements and available aggregate properties. It recommends the optimum combined aggregate gradation within code limits and predicts concrete properties. Furthermore, the system provides statistical information that can be used for quality control. Finally, as the actual concrete production data becomes available, it can be added to the database and used in future designs. This paper reviews the model development and implementation steps. It also summarizes the process of developing the full-scale system. Validation and reliability of the developed system are then discussed.",1

Unfortunately, to date, recycling is still the exception rather than the norm. In this paper, the composition of the C&D debris is identified. Sources and quantification of the construction waste stream are presented. In addition, the causes and effects of construction related reasons for waste generation are identified in order to be eliminated or reduced.

A framework for pavement treatment alternative selection through life cycle cost analysis,"S He, O Salem, B Salman",2019/6/12,"Conference 2019 Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference, CSCE 2019","Aging road infrastructure and budgetary limitations have made it increasingly important to optimize roadway maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation (MRR) expenditures in the United States. For the past few decades, several non-traditional rehabilitation techniques, such as the use of warm mix asphalt, cold in-place recycling, full depth reclamation, and intelligent compaction, have proved effective in addressing asphalt pavement deficiencies while reducing project costs, shortening activity durations, and improving quality of work. While many studies have been conducted on the life cycle costs of MRR projects, very few have evaluated non-traditional techniques with in-depth analysis of user costs. This study focuses on life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) of these non-traditional techniques by investigating agency costs, user cost due to travel delay, user cost due to additional fuel consumption, and user cost due to higher numbers of crashes. A total of six life cycle MRR alternatives were developed, where four represent the nontraditional techniques and the other two represent traditional techniques as benchmarks. Cost data for agency costs were obtained through a survey of state departments of transportation and RSMeans 2016. User cost data were obtained from literature, within which fuel consumption costs were estimated through Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator. Results show that alternatives involving asphalt recycling and intelligent compaction have lower overall life cycle costs. It is also concluded that user travel delay costs account for a major portion of the overall life cycle costs, so decision makers are recommended to select MRR …",
Assessment of traffic emission impacts due to rigid pavement rehabilitation activities,"Sudipta Ghorai, Ossama Salem, Baris Salman",2016,"Conference 8th International Conference on Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements, MAIREPAV 2016","Pavement maintenance, repair and rehabilitation (MRR) processes may have considerable environmental impacts due to traffic disruptions associated with work zones. Various sources indicate that greenhouse gas emissions due to traffic delays and additional fuel consumption have increased drastically over the last decades as a result of congestion. The simulation models in use to predict the emission of work-zones are mostly static emission factor models (SEFD) which calculate emissions based on average operation conditions eg average speed and type of vehicles. Although these models produce accurate results for large scale planning studies, they are not suitable for analyzing driving conditions at the micro level such as acceleration, deceleration, idling, cruising and queuing in a work zone. The purpose of this study is to address this gap by using integrated traffic micro-simulation emission model which can capture the effects of instantaneous changes in vehicle operation and can provide an accurate prediction of traffic impacts and emissions for a work zone related to rehabilitation of rigid pavements. Software program, INTEGRATION, was used to model real life work zone traffic scenario with traffic emissions around the area. The program is capable of computing vehicle emissions such as hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) for eleven vehicle categories.

Exacerbating the problem, a large number of urban highways are crippled with congestion resulting in large amounts of wasted fuel, emissions, delays, and higher number of accidents. Management of congested highways is challenging due to the potential for higher rates of deterioration as a result of increased usage and also due to the higher user costs that are direct results of work zones during maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation (MRR) activities. Therefore, transportation agencies and local governments are placing more emphasis on innovative MRR techniques that have the potential to reduce the economic, social, and environmental impacts associated with traditional MRR techniques. In accord with the increasing needs for tools that will facilitate better management of highway networks, a research project has been initiated at Syracuse University with an objective of investigating various innovative MRR techniques that can be employed in improvement of asphalt roadways and developing a high-level decision support tool that will assist in determining the most suitable MRR technique under various scenarios.

The focus of this paper is the development and implementation efforts of the communications plan of AT&U's IMS. The components of the plan include: issues and objectives, strategies used, identification of target audiences, vehicles and formats used to distribute information, key messages or themes, a performance (evaluation) measurement framework for the information formats and messages, sent and received. It also presents the IMS communications processes model that illustrates the life cycle of a project communications message from creation to final storage.",
XPILES: An expert system for selecting the appropriate type of piles and pile-driving hammers,"O Salem, P Dozzi",1997/1/1,Conference Proceedings of the 1997 Annual Conference of Canadian Society for Civil Engineering. Part 4 (of 7),"Pile foundations have been used for hundreds of years to transfer building loads to appropriate depths. Recently, and especially for the last four decades, many analytical and experimental studies on piles have been performed and many types of piles have been used. The most common function of piles is to make it possible to build in areas where the soil conditions are unfavorable for shallow foundations. In other words, transfer a load that cannot be adequately supported at shallow depths to a depth where adequate support becomes available. The initial selection of a pile foundation represents a well constrained heuristic problem that requires judgment and experience. Artificial intelligence, primarily Expert Systems, is designed to emulate the problem solving process used by human expert. The effort, knowledge, and experience needed for pile selection and construction are well suited problem for expert systems. This paper presents a computer based expert system, XPILES, that advice the user on what type of pile foundations and driving hammers is appropriate for a certain project.",

AC 2012-4255: STEPPING OUTSIDE THE BOX: EDUCATION OF GLOBAL ENGINEERS,Samuel P Clemence,"Learning to work effectively within the global context of today’s world requires both technical and intercultural competency beyond what is gained in a traditional course of study. Global engineers should possess cultural sensitivity and knowledge, as well as the interpersonal skills, to adapt within a variety of cultural contexts and with people that differ from their own experiences. A positive attribute of this intercultural literacy is that designs and solutions are no longer bound within the technical domain, but should be reflective of the engineer’s cultural understanding and interpersonal competence. Working closely with the Dubai Contracting Company (DCC) and in collaboration with the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Syracuse University, the authors have successfully designed and implemented an innovative program to provide students with distinctive skill sets to enhance their capacity as global civil engineers in real and practical ways through university-industry partnerships and networks. The result is a unique program that engages American and Middle Eastern civil engineering students to work together in a summer internship in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the Dubai Contracting Company (DCC). Through a combination of learning and discussion sessions at corporate headquarters, hands-on experience on actual project sites, and visits to architectural/engineering firms and fabrication/machine shops, students learn the detailed workings of the contracting and construction industry in Dubai and the region. During this time, American and Middle Eastern students also work collaboratively on team projects.

STOCK WASTE REDUCTION USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS,"Yaser MA Khalifa, Adham A Shahin, Ossama M Salem","In this paper, a model using Genetic Algorithms (GA) for reducing one-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem in construction projects is developed. One-dimensional construction stocks (ie, steel rebars, steel sections, dimensional lumber, etc.) are one of the major contributors to the construction waste stream. Construction wastes account for a significant portion of America’s municipal waste stream. Cutting one-dimensional stocks to suit needed project lengths results in trim losses, which are the main causes of one-dimensional stock wastes.Three real life case studies from a local steel workshop in Fargo, North Dakota have been studied, and their solutions (cutting schedules) using the GA approach are presented and compared to the actual workshop cutting schedules that using integer programming. The comparison shows a high potential of savings that could be achieved.","Scholar articles STOCK WASTE REDUCTION USING GENETIC ALGORITHMSYMA Khalifa, AA Shahin, OM SalemRelated articles ","In this paper, a model using Genetic Algorithms (GA) for reducing one-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem in construction projects is developed.

A Comparison of the Effects of Time Clauses in Private and Public Contracts on Projects’ Construction Duration,"A El-Assaly, M Farag, O Salem, S Fahmy","In any construction contract, the use of precise wording and fair allocation of risk in contract clauses has a great impact on the project performance, which certainly affects the achievement of the project completion date. Clauses within a contract should fit together to form a reasonably allocated risk among project parties, be procedurally correct, and relevant to the complexity of projectsThe purpose of this paper is to present a comparison of the selected time related General Conditions contract clauses used by four selected federal, provincial, and private agencies in Alberta, Canada. The General Conditions clauses include the ones that relate to the time for performance of the contract, as well as that deal with actions required at specific points in time within a contract. A clear and more complete General Condition documentation should end up a win-win situation.

For Improved Construction Planning,"Abhijeet S Deshpande, Ossama M Salem, Richard Alan Miller","The methods typically used for construction project planning, viz. bar charts and critical path method are effective in describing only one aspect of project control, temporal description of the activities that are required for successful completion of the project. The spatial description of the activities may be provided textually in the schedule, but the spatial interaction between various activities is not completely addressed. This requires a significant effort on the part of project managers and various subcontractors to ensure that all the subcontractors work harmoniously. This paper describes a case study involving the construction of a large industrial project in the US where the temporal data in the CPM schedule was integrated with the three dimensional model using the Navisworks® software.

Stochastic Analysis of User Costs,"A Deshpande, O Salem, A El-Assaly","The highway user costs are the costs incurred by highway users and the community at large as a result of planned changes in highway capacity and pavement condition and the effects of road construction and maintenance. The user costs essentially include additional travel time related costs, safety costs, costs of operating vehicles in normal as well as work zone conditions, environmental costs. A holistic analysis of competing infrastructure rehabilitation alternatives should include user costs to ensure economically efficient investment. The lack of widespread use of user costs can be attributed to lack of robust models and standard guidelines for calculating user costs.
