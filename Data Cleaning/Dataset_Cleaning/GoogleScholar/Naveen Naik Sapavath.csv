Recent advances in mobile edge computing and content caching,"Sunitha Safavat, Naveen Naik Sapavath, Danda B Rawat",2020/5/1,Source Digital Communications and Networks,"The demand for digital media services is increasing as the number of wireless subscriptions is growing exponentially. In order to meet this growing need, mobile wireless networks have been advanced at a tremendous pace over recent days. However, the centralized architecture of existing mobile networks, with limited capacity and range of bandwidth of the radio access network and low bandwidth back-haul network, can not handle the exponentially increasing mobile traffic. Recently, we have seen the growth of new mechanisms of data caching and delivery methods through intermediate caching servers. In this paper, we present a survey on recent advances in mobile edge computing and content caching, including caching insertion and expulsion policies, the behavior of the caching system, and caching optimization based on wireless networks. Some of the important open challenges in mobile edge computing …",84
Wireless virtualization architecture: Wireless networking for Internet of Things,"Naveen Naik Sapavath, Danda B Rawat",2019/9/19,Journal IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"In this article, we design, develop, and evaluate a wireless virtualization (WiVi) architecture for wireless networking for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) or 5G network applications by using a three-layer game theory model. WiVi is regarded as an emerging network paradigm to support different network service requirements (delay sensitive, bandwidth hungry, high data rate, etc.) for different IoT applications. In the proposed three-layer game model, interactions among three entities: 1) wireless resource providers (WRPs); 2) mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs); and 3) their subscribed wireless users (i.e., IoT devices), are formulated as strategies to optimize their respective utilities. The WiVi enables WRPs (also known as layer-1 leaders in the three-layer game) to sublease their wireless resources to MVNOs (also known as layer-2 leaders in the three-layer game) through RF slicing and adaptively setting their …",31

Large‐scale MIMO is regarded as an emerging technology to enhance data rate of future wireless networks and the wireless virtualization is regarded as an efficient paradigm to enhance the radio frequency (RF) spectrum utilization by subleasing RF slices of wireless infrastructure providers to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). We leverage machine learning approach for scheduling the beams in large‐scale MIMO where RF slices with the help of subsets of antennas are subleased for MVNOs.

Performance evaluation of deception system for deceiving cyber adversaries in adaptive virtualized wireless networks,"Danda B Rawat, Naveen Sapavath, Min Song",2019/11/7,Book Proceedings of the 4th ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing,"Malicious actions by cyber-adversaries are growing exponentially which makes it difficult to combat cyber-attacks for emerging networked cyber physical systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT). Furthermore, wireless networks - major communication media for most emerging CPS and IoT applications - are highly vulnerable to cyber attacks because of their nature of open communications. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the cyber deception system to combat cyber adversaries in virtualized wireless networking framework where software defined network (SDN) controller creates mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and continuously senses the network, observes the connections and creates deception MVNO to direct cyber adversaries. The deception MVNO can be used to learn about cyber adversaries in terms of their capabilities, intent and how much damage they can do in the system and so …",8
Maximizing secrecy rate and payoff through wireless virtualization in heterogeneous wireless networks,"Naveen Naik Sapavath, Dema Saad Alorini, Danda B Rawat, Moses Garuba",2019/2/18,"Conference 2019 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)","In this paper, we study secrecy rate maximization through wireless virtualization in heterogeneous wireless networks where Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) borrow frequency slices from Wireless Infrastructure Providers (WIPs) and serve the end users. For subleasing their frequency slices to MVNOs, WIPs use their service level agreements (SLA) with MVNOs to divide and reconfigure their RF bands. Then, we use two stage game for maximizing the payoff of MVNOs and secrecy rates (aka payoff) of end users. The performance of the proposed game is evaluated using numerical results where MVNOs offer lowers price to attract more users or more requests from users and the end users adapt their strategies to improve their secrecy rates.",5
Machine learning for rf slicing using csi prediction in software defined large-scale mimo wireless networks,"Naveen Naik Sapavath, Danda B Rawat, Min Song",2020/5/11,Journal IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,"In this paper, we investigate the machine learning approaches (sparse Bayesian linear regression (SBLR) and support vector machine (SVM)) for channel state information (CSI) prediction and dynamic radio frequency (RF) slicing for software defined virtual wireless networks in large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wireless networks. Specifically, a subset of the antennas of virtual wireless networks transmits pilot symbols for estimating the CSI and use the estimated CSI dataset to train and estimate the remaining channels and future CSI for virtual networks using machine learning algorithms. This helps not only to predict the CSI with least overhead and fulfills the service demands of users but also to reduce the power consumption and computation overhead in the network. Predicted CSI is leveraged for RF slicing for virtual wireless networks. Simulation results show that the proposed SBLR for predicting CSI …",3
