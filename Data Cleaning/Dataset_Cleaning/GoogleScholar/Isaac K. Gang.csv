Parallel Implementation and Analysis of Mandelbrot Set Construction,"IK. Gang, D. Dobson, J. Gourd, D. Ali",2008,"Description Mandelbrot Set is a mathematical application that has gained wide recognition outside of mathematics because of its appeal and complex structure. Our goal is to examine the serial algorithm of this set, devise a parallel algorithm, and implement it using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We conclude with performance measurements and a comprehensive analysis.INTRODUCTION:","Mandelbrot Set is a mathematical application that has gained wide recognition outside of mathematics because of its appeal and complex structure.

Real time employees overtime predictor model,"Shaun Stearns, Isaac K Gang",2021/3/15,Journal 2021 IEMS Officers,"Employers often struggle with a cost-efficient way to schedule workers and handle overtime. Paying employees overtime is a very inefficient and expensive way to keep a department going. In this paper, we will analyze data from New York City public workers to explore what factors influence the amount of overtime workers have accumulated. We are particularly interested in the factors that predict an increase in overtime and how to possibly adapt them. To accurately answer these questions, we use R-Studio to analyze the predictor variables that would impact overtime for each New York City borough. We further analyzed the differences in overtime per Borough using ANOVA. Follow-up tests were performed using pairwise comparisons; differences per borough were corrected for multiple comparisons using Scheffe’s method. After thorough analysis, we perform multiple regressions on each Borough.",
Robust cardiovascular disease prediction using logistic regression,"Snigdha Datta, Isaac K Gang",2021,"Publisher Association for Industry, Engineering and Management Systems (AIEMS)","Cardiovascular disease, commonly known as heart disease, is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide. Early detection of the disease can save thousands of lives and billions of dollars in healthcare costs. A statistical model with the ability to accurately predict heart disease could be of immense help to the patients, their families, the medical community, and the healthcare system. Hospitals and providers collect many patient health metrics during screening and routine lab tests, which could be used to build such a statistical model. A robust heart disease prediction model is built using a sample dataset from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning repository. Initial Hypotheses are formulated, and the most significant predictor variables are identified using the Wald test. The statistical significance of the proposed model is tested using the Likelihood-Ratio test. A repeated 10-fold cross-validation technique is used to evaluate the model's prediction power on previously unseen data. Keeping in mind the simplicity, usability, and explainability of results to the medical community, a Logistic Regression model that predicts the heart disease class with a high degree of accuracy is presented in this paper.",

Real Time Employee Skills Tracking System,"Matthew Liberty, Chase Covington, Kameron Smith, Isaac K Gang",2014/3/24,Journal GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY MOBILE READINESS,"Any large company will probably have a large number of job applicants with various skill sets and amounts of experience. Thus, it would be beneficial to such an organization to have means to efficiently browse, organize, and maintain records of each applicant’s relevant skills, experience, and contact information. In this work, we describe and demonstrate a software application to manage such records, written in C# using object-oriented design principles and techniques. An interface is used as an abstraction layer for the data storage mechanism, allowing the backend to be interchangeable (ie, the applicant records can be stored in a local computer file, relational database table, etc.).",

Revolutionary Image Analysis Techniques Using Bidimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD),"Isaac K Gang, Dia Ali",2013/7/1,Journal Journal of Management & Engineering Integration,"Given the substantial use of imagery in computer science and various scientific fields, the need for efficient methodology to analyze images and, as a result, extract meaningful information from them, is critical. The quest for such a methodology, especially formulation of feature extraction operator with low error probability, accurate, and consistent, has been difficult. This prompts an obvious need to carefully investigate fresh ideas and domains. This research, therefore, introduces a high quality and computationally efficient image feature detection methodology using bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD). This sifting process decomposes a signal/image into its two-dimensional (2D) bidimensional intrinsic mode functions (BIMFs).",

BEMDEC: An adaptive and robust methodology for digital image feature extraction,Isaac Kueth Gang,2010,Institution The University of Southern Mississippi,"The intriguing study of feature extraction, and edge detection in particular, has, as a result of the increased use of imagery, drawn even more attention not just from the field of computer science but also from a variety of scientific fields. However, various challenges surrounding the formulation of feature extraction operator, particularly of edges, which is capable of satisfying the necessary properties of low probability of error (ie, failure of marking true edges), accuracy, and consistent response to a single edge, continue to persist. Moreover, it should be pointed out that most of the work in the area of feature extraction has been focused on improving many of the existing approaches rather than devising or adopting new ones. In the image processing subfield, where the needs constantly change, we must equally change the way we think.",
