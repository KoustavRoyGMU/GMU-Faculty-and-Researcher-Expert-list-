Hearing your voice is not enough: An articulatory gesture based liveness detection for voice authentication,"Linghan Zhang, Sheng Tan, Jie Yang",2017/10/30,Book Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"Voice biometrics is drawing increasing attention as it is a promising alternative to legacy passwords for mobile authentication. Recently, a growing body of work shows that voice biometrics is vulnerable to spoofing through replay attacks, where an adversary tries to spoof voice authentication systems by using a pre-recorded voice sample collected from a genuine user. In this work, we propose VoiceGesture, a liveness detection system for replay attack detection on smartphones. It detects a live user by leveraging both the unique articulatory gesture of the user when speaking a passphrase and the mobile audio hardware advances. Specifically, our system re-uses the smartphone as a Doppler radar, which transmits a high frequency acoustic sound from the built-in speaker and listens to the reflections at the microphone when a user speaks a passphrase. The signal reflections due to user's articulatory gesture result …",183
Voicelive: A phoneme localization based liveness detection for voice authentication on smartphones,"Linghan Zhang, Sheng Tan, Jie Yang, Yingying Chen",2016/10/24,Book Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"Voice authentication is drawing increasing attention and becomes an attractive alternative to passwords for mobile authentication. Recent advances in mobile technology further accelerate the adoption of voice biometrics in an array of diverse mobile applications.

MultiTrack: Multi-user tracking and activity recognition using commodity WiFi,"Sheng Tan, Linghan Zhang, Zi Wang, Jie Yang",2019/5/2,Book Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"This paper presents MultiTrack, a commodity WiFi based human sensing system that can track multiple users and recognize activities of multiple users performing them simultaneously. Such a system can enable easy and large-scale deployment for multi-user tracking and sensing without the need for additional sensors through the use of existing WiFi devices (e.g., desktops, laptops and smart appliances). The basic idea is to identify and extract the signal reflection corresponding to each individual user with the help of multiple WiFi links and all the available WiFi channels at 5GHz. Given the extracted signal reflection of each user, MultiTrack examines the path of the reflected signals at multiple links to simultaneously track multiple users. It further reconstructs the signal profile of each user as if only a single user has performed activity in the environment to facilitate multi-user activity recognition. We evaluate …",74

Sensing fruit ripeness using wireless signals,"Sheng Tan, Linghan Zhang, Jie Yang",2018/7/30,Conference 2018 27th international conference on computer communication and networks (ICCCN),"This paper presents FruitSense, a novel fruit ripeness sensing system that leverages wireless signals to enable non-destructive and low-cost detection of fruit ripeness. Such a system can reuse existing WiFi devices in homes without the need for additional sensors. It uses WiFi signals to sense the physiological changes associated with fruit ripening for detecting the ripeness of fruit. FruitSense leverages the larger bandwidth at 5GHz (i.e., over 600MHz) to extract the multipath-independent signal components to characterize the physiological compounds of the fruit. It then measures the similarity between the extracted features and the ones in ripeness profiles for identifying the ripeness level. We evaluate FruitSense in different multipath environments with two types of fruits (i.e, kiwi and avocado) under four levels of ripeness. Experimental results show that FruitSense can detect the ripeness levels of fruits with an …",26

Viblive: A continuous liveness detection for secure voice user interface in iot environment,"Linghan Zhang, Sheng Tan, Zi Wang, Yili Ren, Zhi Wang, Jie Yang",2020/12/7,Book Annual Computer Security Applications Conference," The voice user interface (VUI) has been progressively used to authenticate users to numerous devices and applications. Such massive adoption of VUIs in IoT environments like individual homes and businesses arises extensive privacy and security concerns. Latest VUIs adopting traditional voice authentication methods are vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where a malicious party spoofs the VUIs with pre-recorded or synthesized voice commands of the genuine user.

A Wearable-based Distracted Driving Detection Leveraging BLE,"Travis Mewborne, Linghan Zhang, Sheng Tan",2021/11/15,Book Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,"Distracted driving has become a serious problem for traffic safety with the increasing number of fatalities every year. Existing systems have shortcomings of requiring additional hardware or vehicle motion data separation. Moreover, the excessive use of motion sensors can cause fast battery drain which is impractical for everyday use. In this work, we present a wearable-based distracted driving detection system that leverages Bluetooth. The proposed system exploits already in-vehicle BLE compatible devices to track the driver's hand position and infer potential unsafe driving behaviors. Preliminary study shows our system can achieve over 95% detection accuracy for various distracted driving behaviors.",
