Help your mobile applications with fog computing,"Mohammed A Hassan, Mengbai Xiao, Qi Wei, Songqing Chen",2015/6/22,"Conference 2015 12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking-Workshops (SECON Workshops)","Cloud computing has paved a way for resource-constrained mobile devices to speed up their computing tasks and to expand their storage capacity. However, cloud computing is not necessary a panacea for all mobile applications. The high network latency to cloud data centers may not be ideal for delay-sensitive applications while storing everything on public clouds risks users' security and privacy. In this paper, we discuss two preliminary ideas, one for mobile application offloading and the other for mobile storage expansion, by leveraging the edge intelligence offered by fog computing to help mobile applications. Preliminary experiments conducted based on implemented prototypes show that fog computing can provide an effective and sometimes better alternative to help mobile applications.",133

Pomac: Properly offloading mobile applications to clouds,"Mohammed A Hassan, Kshitiz Bhattarai, Qi Wei, Songqing Chen",2014,Journal Energy (J),"Prior research on mobile computation offloading has mainly focused on how to offload as well as what to offload. However, the problem of whether the offloading should be done attracted much less attention. In addition, existing offloading schemes either require special compilation or modification to the applications’ source code or binary, making them difficult to be deployed in practice. In this work, we introduce POMAC, a framework to enable dynamic and transparent mobile application offloading to clouds. A prototype has been implemented on the Dalvik virtual machine and our preliminary evaluations show that POMAC can outperform existing schemes significantly and work with real-world applications seamlessly.",37
Physically-based modeling and simulation of extraocular muscles,"Qi Wei, Shinjiro Sueda, Dinesh K Pai",2010/12/1,Source Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,"Dynamic simulation of human eye movements, with realistic physical models of extraocular muscles (EOMs), may greatly advance our understanding of the complexities of the oculomotor system and aid in treatment of visuomotor disorders. In this paper we describe the first three dimensional (3D) biomechanical model which can simulate the dynamics of ocular motility at interactive rates. We represent EOMs using “strands”, which are physical primitives that can model an EOM’s complex nonlinear anatomical and physiological properties. Contact between the EOMs, the globe, and orbital structures can be explicitly modeled. Several studies were performed to assess the validity and utility of the model. EOM deformation during smooth pursuit was simulated and compared with published experimental data; the model reproduces qualitative features of the observed nonuniformity.

Proceedings 5","Understanding the neural control and mechanics of human eye movement has significant implications for treating vision disorders. A computational model incorporating physiological properties and nonlinear kinematics of the oculomotor plant’s geometry and extraocular muscle (EOM) mechanics is desirable for scientific studies and clinical applications. We simulate realistic three-dimensional eye fixation using a new biomechanical simulation framework. We model EOMs as a collection of “strands,” which are modeling elements for musculotendon mechanics based on splines with inertia. Anatomical variations in EOM and globe geometry across individuals can be taken into account. Complicated nonlinear EOM mechanics as well as the recently discovered pulleys are included in the computation.

Investigating redundant Internet video streaming traffic on iOS devices: Causes and solutions,"Yao Liu, Qi Wei, Lei Guo, Bo Shen, Songqing Chen, Yingjie Lan",2013/11/28,Journal IEEE transactions on multimedia,"The Internet has witnessed rapidly increasing streaming traffic to various mobile devices. In this paper, through analysis of a server-side workload and experiments in a controlled lab environment, we find that current practice has introduced a significant amount of redundant traffic. In particular, for the popular iOS based mobile devices, accessing popular Internet streaming services typically involves about 10%-70% redundant traffic. Such a practice not only over-utilizes and wastes resources on the server side and the network (cellular or Internet), but also consumes additional battery power on user's mobile devices and leads to possible monetary cost. To alleviate such a situation without changing the server side or the client side, we design and implement CStreamer that can transparently work between existing mobile clients and servers.

Simulating human optics is useful for understanding basic questions of vision science and for studying vision defects and their corrections. Because of the complexity of computing such simulations accurately, most previous efforts used simplified analytical models of the normal eye. This makes them less effective in modeling vision disorders associated with abnormal shapes of the ocular structures which are hard to be precisely represented by analytical surfaces. We have developed a computer simulator that can simulate ocular structures of arbitrary shapes, for instance represented by polygon meshes.

Vastus lateralis and vastus medialis produce distinct mediolateral forces on the patella but similar forces on the tibia in the rat,"Thomas G Sandercock, Qi Wei, Yasin Y Dhaher, Dinesh K Pai, Matthew C Tresch",2018/11/16,Journal Journal of biomechanics,"Improper activation of the quadriceps muscles vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) has been implicated in the development of patellofemoral pain (PFP). This explanation of PFP assumes that VM and VL produce opposing mediolateral forces on the patella. Although studies have provided evidence for opposing actions of VM and VL on the patella, other studies have suggested that their actions might be similar. In this study, we took advantage of the experimental accessibility of the rat to directly measure the forces on the patella produced by VM and VL. We found that VM and VL produce opposing mediolateral forces on the patella when the patella was lifted away from the femur. These distinct mediolateral forces were not transmitted to the tibia, however: forces measured at the distal tibia were very similar for VM and VL. Further, when the patella was placed within the trochlear groove, the forces on the …",10
ELICIT: Efficiently identify computation-intensive tasks in mobile applications for offloading,"Mohammed A Hassan, Qi Wei, Songqing Chen",2015/8/6,"Conference 2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)","As mobile devices are battery powered and have less computing resources, plenty of research has been conducted on how to efficiently offload computing-intensive tasks in a mobile application to more powerful counterpart.

Uncertainty in limb configuration makes minimal contribution to errors between observed and predicted forces in a musculoskeletal model of the rat hindlimb,"Qi Wei, Dinesh K Pai, Matthew C Tresch",2017/11/20,Journal IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,"Subject-specific musculoskeletal models are increasingly used in biomedical applications to predict endpoint forces due to muscle activation, matching predicted forces to experimentally observed forces at a specific limb configuration. However, it is difficult to precisely measure the limb configuration at which these forces are observed. The consequent uncertainty in limb configuration might contribute to errors in model predictions. We therefore evaluated how uncertainties in limb configuration measurement contributed to errors in force prediction, using data from in vivo measurements in the rat hindlimb. We used a data-driven approach to estimate the uncertainty in estimated limb configuration and then used this configuration uncertainty to evaluate the consequent uncertainty in force predictions, using Monte Carlo simulations.

Machine learning classification reveals robust morphometric biomarker of glial and neuronal arbors,"Masood A Akram, Qi Wei, Giorgio A Ascoli",2023/1,Journal Journal of Neuroscience Research,"Neurons and glia are the two main cell classes in the nervous systems of most animals. Although functionally distinct, neurons and glia are both characterized by multiple branching arbors stemming from the cell bodies. Glial processes are generally known to form smaller trees than neuronal dendrites. However, the full extent of morphological differences between neurons and glia in multiple species and brain regions has not yet been characterized, nor is it known whether these cells can be reliably distinguished based on geometric features alone. Here, we show that multiple supervised learning algorithms deployed on a large database of morphological reconstructions can systematically classify neuronal and glial arbors with nearly perfect accuracy and precision. Moreover, we report multiple morphometric properties, both size related and size independent, that differ substantially between these cell types. In …",3

Symposium at the Society for Neuroscience Meeting,"Understanding the neural control of movement requires realistic computational models of the underlying musculo-skeletal system. Even though detailed models exist for the biomechanical properties of muscle tissue, current models of entire systems do not fully account for the distributed, three dimensional nature of muscle action. The importance of detailed biomechanical models for neuroscience have been described by (Loeb, Brown, Lan, & Davoodi, 2001), and even earlier by (Lombard & Abbot, 1907) who said:“before we can arrive at reliable conclusions as to the method of action of the central nervous mechanisms concerned in reflex actions, we must obtain a clear picture of the mechanics of the limb itself.” Current models either represent muscle by lines of force with via points (eg,(Delp & Loan, 1995), or require expensive finite element methods (eg,(Hirota, Fisher, State, Lee, & Fuchs, 2001; Teran, Blemker, Hing, & Fedkiw, 2003)). We are developing a new computational model for neuro-musculo-skeletal simulation which addresses these problems. The model is based on a computational primitive called a “muscle strand.” The passive elastic behavior of the strand is based on the theory of Cosserat rods (Rubin, 2000; Pai, 2002). These one-dimensional primitives are well suited for incorporation of muscle activation models along the principal axis of the strand (eg,(Zajac, 1989; Cheng, Brown, & Loeb, 2000)).",3

Longitudinal strain estimation in incompressible cylindrical tissues from magnetic resonance imaging,"Qi Wei, Dinesh K Pai",2009/9/3,Conference 2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,"In this paper, we present a simple approach for estimating the average longitudinal strains from models reconstructed from medical images.

Urinary incontinence can negatively impact a person’s overall quality of life and lead them into stages of embarrassment and depression. It is an underrepresented and undertreated condition prevalent in women, especially in low socioeconomic regions where women may not be able to express their concerns due to unawareness of diagnosis and treatment/management options. There are different diagnostic and management protocols for UI; however, utilizing artificially intelligent systems is not standard care. This paper overviews the use of artificial intelligence in women’s health and as a means of cost-effectively diagnosing patients, and as an avenue for providing low-cost treatments to women that suffer from urinary incontinence in low-resource communities. Studies found that these systems, mainly utilizing artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), served to be an effective method in diagnosing patients and providing an avenue for personalized treatment for improved patient outcomes.

Our previous work modeled a 2-DOF robotic eye driven by Super-Coiled Polymer (SCP) artificial muscles and presented a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) learning-based controller. The control policy requires access to the full system states that include the orientation of the robotic eye and temperature changes of the SCPs. While the angular orientations of the robotic eye can be determined using embedded sensors or image-processing of the visual feed, it is quite laborious and expensive to measure the temperatures of the slender SCP muscles without affecting robot dynamics.

Review of Emerging Technologies in Pelvic Floor Ultrasonography,"Laura De Marzi, Yael Baumfeld, Qi Wei, S Abbas Shobeiri",2022/5/10,Source Open Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,"Pelvic floor dysfunction is a common morbidity with a negative impact on quality of life. These disorders include multiple clinical conditions which range from urinary and defecatory disorders to sexual disorders, affecting 24% of women. Since the pelvic floor is one of the most complex regions in the human body, in order to perform an accurate diagnosis, it is important to combine history taking, physical examination and imaging. While in the past, diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunction was done using history taking and physical examination alone, it had been recognized the need for imaging as well. In the last decades different imaging modalities have been in use, including magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography scanning and, nowadays, the use of ultrasonography is gaining popularity. Ultrasound technology is evolving, with technology for 3D, 4D, Doppler and more, making it optimal for pelvic floor imaging. In this paper we review the different ultrasound modalities for pelvic floor imaging. The purpose of this review is to introduce the emerging ultrasound technologies for pelvic floor imaging including volume render mode, fusion imaging, framing, motion tracking and color vector mapping and elastography. The different ultrasonography modalities have resulted to be very useful for the diagnosis and assessment of pelvic floor dysfunctions, they are characterized by availability, short time, low cost, and radiation free. However, the effectiveness of the analysis is operator-dependent.",

There are several methods to mitigate or reduce this problem such as medication, surgery, or exercises. Of various types of urinary incontinence, overactive bladder consists of one category, which is often resistant to various treatments. Electrical stimulation methods have been considered a treatment option of overactive bladder. We here briefly summarize various treatment options for urinary incontinence, with special reference to the role of electrical stimulation methods for this disease. Electrical stimulation methods include vaginal electrical stimulation (VES), posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). The three methods have shown good results, and these findings will contribute to achieving a better quality of life for patients.",
Biomechanical modeling of actively controlled rectus extraocular muscle pulleys,"Qi Wei, Bassam Mutawak, Joseph L Demer",2022/4/6,Journal Scientific Reports,"The Active Pulley Hypothesis (APH) is based on modern functional anatomical descriptions of the oculomotor plant, and postulates behaviors of the orbital pulleys proposed to be positioned by the extraocular muscles (EOMs).

The orbital (OL) and global (GL) layers of the horizontal rectus EOMs were implemented as separate musculoskeletal strands. Pulley sleeves were modeled as tube-like structures receiving the OL insertion and suspended by elastic strands. Stiffnesses and orientations of pulley suspensions were determined empirically to limit horizontal rectus EOM side-slip while allowing anteroposterior pulley travel. Independent neural drives of the OL greater than GL were assumed. The model was iteratively refined in secondary gazes …",

We implemented a novel computational method that optimally registers volumetric ultrasound image data containing significant and local anatomical differences. It is A Multi-stage, Multi-resolution, and Multi-volumes-of-interest Volume Registration Method. A single region registration is optimized first for a close initial alignment to avoid convergence to a locally optimal solution. Multiple sub-volumes of interest can then be selected as target alignment regions to achieve confident consistency across the volume. Finally, a multi-resolution rigid registration is performed on these sub-volumes associated with different weights in the cost function. We applied the method on 3D endovaginal ultrasound image data acquired from patients during biopsy procedure of the pelvic floor muscle. Systematic assessment of our proposed method through cross validation demonstrated its accuracy and robustness. The algorithm can also be applied on medical imaging data of other modalities for which the traditional rigid registration methods would fail.",

A BIOMECHANICAL MODEL OF THE RAT HINDLIMB: MODELING WITH STRANDS AND SUBJECT-SPECIFIC REGISTRATION,"Qi Wei, Anthony Jarc, Sang Hoon Yeo, TG Sandercock, Matthew C Tresch, Dinesh K Pai","A three-dimensional neuro-musculoskeletal model of the rat hindlimb was developed, which simulates muscle actions and dynamic movement of the hindlimb. The goals of the study were to use this computational model to study the biomechanical consequences of muscle actions and to quantitatively assess characteristics of complex musculoskeletal systems through model-based simulation against experimental observations.The model has several distinctive features. Muscles and tendons were represented by strands, which are novel musculotendon primitives [1] and are able to model curved paths. In order to simulate complex interactions between musculotendons and the skeleton, the model utilizes features of the strand framework such as sliding and force transmission along general constraints, which are hard to simulate with previous models. Given target motion trajectory of the skeletons, the simulator can calculate muscle innervations that drive the skeletons to produce the desired motion. Dynamic movement can be simulated at interactive rates. Unlike some of the existing biomechanical simulators, this strand-based model does not lump muscle masses with bone segments but associates distributed mass with each strand, which avoids one source of errors in dynamic simulation [2].","Scholar articles A BIOMECHANICAL MODEL OF THE RAT HINDLIMB: MODELING WITH STRANDS AND SUBJECT-SPECIFIC REGISTRATIONQ Wei, A Jarc, SH Yeo, TG Sandercock, MC Tresch…Related articles ","A three-dimensional neuro-musculoskeletal model of the rat hindlimb was developed, which simulates muscle actions and dynamic movement of the hindlimb.
