Sampling-based roadmap of trees for parallel motion planning,"Erion Plaku, Kostas E Bekris, Brian Y Chen, Andrew M Ladd, Lydia E Kavraki",2005/8/8,Journal IEEE Transactions on Robotics,"This paper shows how to effectively combine a sampling-based method primarily designed for multiple-query motion planning [probabilistic roadmap method (PRM)] with sampling-based tree methods primarily designed for single-query motion planning (expansive space trees, rapidly exploring random trees, and others) in a novel planning framework that can be efficiently parallelized. Our planner not only achieves a smooth spectrum between multiple-query and single-query planning, but it combines advantages of both. We present experiments which show that our planner is capable of solving problems that cannot be addressed efficiently with PRM or single-query planners. A key advantage of our planner is that it is significantly more decoupled than PRM and sampling-based tree planners. Exploiting this property, we designed and implemented a parallel version of our planner. Our experiments show that our …",210
Motion planning with dynamics by a synergistic combination of layers of planning,"Erion Plaku, Lydia E Kavraki, Moshe Y Vardi",2010/6/3,Journal IEEE Transactions on Robotics,"To efficiently solve challenges related to motion-planning problems with dynamics, this paper proposes treating motion planning not just as a search problem in a continuous space but as a search problem in a hybrid space consisting of discrete and continuous components. A multilayered framework is presented which combines discrete search and sampling-based motion planning. This framework is called synergistic combination of layers of planning ( SyCLoP) hereafter. Discrete search uses a workspace decomposition to compute leads, i.e., sequences of regions in the neighborhood that guide sampling-based motion planning during the state-space exploration. In return, information gathered by motion planning, such as progress made, is fed back to the discrete search. This combination allows SyCLoP to identify new directions to lead the exploration toward the goal, making it possible to efficiently find …",188

Tactile-object recognition from appearance information,"Zachary Pezzementi, Erion Plaku, Caitlin Reyda, Gregory D Hager",2011/4/21,Journal IEEE Transactions on robotics,"This paper explores the connection between sensor-based perception and exploration in the context of haptic object identification.

Motion generation of robotic surgical tasks: Learning from expert demonstrations,"Carol E Reiley, Erion Plaku, Gregory D Hager",2010/8/31,Conference 2010 Annual international conference of the IEEE engineering in medicine and biology,"Robotic surgical assistants offer the possibility of automating portions of a task that are time consuming and tedious in order to reduce the cognitive workload of a surgeon.

Discrete Search Leading Continuous Exploration for Kinodynamic Motion Planning.,"Erion Plaku, Lydia E Kavraki, Moshe Y Vardi",2007/6/27,Conference Robotics: Science and Systems,"This paper presents the Discrete Search Lead-ing continuous eXploration (DSLX) planner, a multi-resolution approach to motion planning that is suitable for challenging problems involving robots with kinodynamic constraints. Initially the method decomposes the workspace to build a graph that encodes the physical adjacency of the decomposed regions. This graph is searched to obtain leads, that is, sequences of regions that can be explored with sampling-based tree methods to generate solution trajectories. Instead of treating the discrete search of the adjacency graph and the exploration of the continuous state space as separate components, DSLX passes information from one to the other in innovative ways. Each lead suggests what regions to explore and the exploration feeds back information to the discrete search to improve the quality of future leads. Information is encoded in edge weights, which indicate the importance of including the regions associated with an edge in the next exploration step. Computation of weights, leads, and the actual exploration make the core loop of the algorithm. Extensive experimentation shows that DSLX is very versatile. The discrete search can drastically change the lead to reflect new information allowing DSLX to find solutions even when sampling-based tree planners get stuck. Experimental results on a variety of challenging kinodynamic motion planning problems show computational speedups of two orders of magnitude over other widely used motion planning methods.",102

The proposed Temporal-PRM approach combines the roadmap with a finite automaton representing the co-safe LTL formula φ and conducts the search over the combined graph. As a result, roadmap connections are reused when needed to find paths that satisfy φ. Experimental validation is provided in simulation by using different scenes, co-safe LTL specifications, a snake-like robot model with numerous degrees-of-freedom, and different sampling strategies.",13

From mutations to mechanisms and dysfunction via computation and mining of protein energy landscapes,"Wanli Qiao, Nasrin Akhter, Xiaowen Fang, Tatiana Maximova, Erion Plaku, Amarda Shehu",2018/9,Journal BMC genomics,"The protein energy landscape underscores the inherent nature of proteins as dynamic molecules interconverting between structures with varying energies. Reconstructing a protein’s energy landscape holds the key to characterizing a protein’s equilibrium conformational dynamics and its relationship to function. Many pathogenic mutations in protein sequences alter the equilibrium dynamics that regulates molecular interactions and thus protein function. In principle, reconstructing energy landscapes of a protein’s healthy and diseased variants is a central step to understanding how mutations impact dynamics, biological mechanisms, and function. Recent computational advances are yielding detailed, sample-based representations of protein energy landscapes. In this paper, we propose and describe two novel methods that leverage computed, sample-based representations of landscapes to reconstruct them and extract from them informative local structures that reveal the underlying organization of an energy landscape. Such structures constitute landscape features that, as we demonstrate here, can be utilized to detect alterations of landscapes upon mutation. The proposed methods detect altered protein energy landscape features in response to sequence mutations. By doing so, the methods allow formulating hypotheses on the impact of mutations on specific biological activities of a protein. This work demonstrates that the availability of energy landscapes of healthy and diseased variants of a protein opens up new avenues to harness the quantitative information embedded in landscapes to summarize mechanisms via which mutations alter …",12

The high-level layer is based on discrete search to find paths over the roadmap that increase the sum of the rewards to the known goals while maintaining the range constraints …",1
Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Unlabeled Goals for Mobile Robots with Differential Constraints,"Duong Le, Erion Plaku",2021/5/30,Conference 2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),"This paper studies the multi-robot motion-planning problem with unlabeled goals where n robots have to reach m goals. The proposed approach also takes into account the underlying dynamics of each robot to produce dynamically-feasible trajectories that enable the robots to reach all the goals while avoiding collisions with the obstacles and each other. The approach leverages the idea of combining sampling-based motion planning with goal assignment and multi-agent search. In fact, the goal-assignment layer seeks to effectively utilize the robots based on estimated costs to reach the remaining goals. The multi-agent search provides nonconflicting paths over roadmap graphs, which then guide the sampling-based expansion of a motion tree. The goal assignments and multi-agent paths are frequently updated based on the progress made during the motion-tree expansion. Simulation experiments using an …",1

Leveraging Neural Networks to Guide Path Planning: Improving Dataset Generation and Planning Efficiency,"Philip Baldoni, James McMahon, Erion Plaku",2022/8/20,Conference 2022 IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE),"Path planning seeks to enable a robot to reach its goal while avoiding collisions with obstacles. Machine learning has been leveraged in recent years to improve the efficiency of path-planning approaches, particularly those based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT). The general idea is to train a neural network using an extensive dataset consisting of solutions obtained by RRT for problems generated at random, and then leveraging the trained neural network to improve the sampling and exploration conducted by RRT on new problems.This paper makes the case that the time to generate the datasets can be drastically reduced by using probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) instead of RRT. Roadmaps make it possible to capture the connectivity of the environment and solve multiple path-planning problems efficiently. We use the datasets to train neural networks based on U-NET.

Antenna-Based Aerial Inspection of Nonflat Terrains using Microwave Remote Sensing,"Baris Can Secim, Tsotne Kvelashvili, Ozlem Kilic, Erion Plaku",2021/8/23,Conference 2021 IEEE 17th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE),This paper proposes the use of antenna-based aerial inspections. We develop an approach that enables an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a microwave remote sensing (MRS) system to effectively scan nonflat terrains. The approach relies on probabilistic sampling and phase shifting to generate a set of waypoints that collectively cover the area of interest. A short tour is also generated that enables the UAV to visit the waypoints in an appropriate order that reduces the overall distance traveled. Experiments with models of real nonflat terrains demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.,
Multi-Robot Motion Planning in Unknown Environments,"SHREY GUPTA, Erion Plaku",2021,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Multi-robot systems provide a viable venue to enhance automation, increase productivity, and reduce operational costs in transportation, surveillance, search-and-rescue, and other fields. Independent planning is no longer possible since the path of one robot can block another robot from reaching its goal. As a result, the robots often have to coordinate their motions to move around obstacles and travel without blocking each other. While related work has assumed full knowledge of the environment and of the obstacles, our framework is able to plan in unknown environments. Each robot is equipped with a radial-based sensor which detects obstacles around them as the robots move. The robots share this information with one another to incrementally build a map of the environment. The framework uses the updated map to find paths that lead each robot to their goal. Path finding relies on advanced AI search …",
Attenuating dependence on structural data in computing protein energy landscapes,"David Morris, Tatiana Maximova, Erion Plaku, Amarda Shehu",2019/6,Journal BMC bioinformatics,"Nearly all cellular processes involve proteins structurally rearranging to accommodate molecular partners. The energy landscape underscores the inherent nature of proteins as dynamic molecules interconverting between structures with varying energies. In principle, reconstructing a protein’s energy landscape holds the key to characterizing the structural dynamics and its regulation of protein function. In practice, the disparate spatio-temporal scales spanned by the slow dynamics challenge both wet and dry laboratories. However, the growing number of deposited structures for proteins central to human biology presents an opportunity to infer the relevant dynamics via exploitation of the information encoded in such structures about equilibrium dynamics. Recent computational efforts using extrinsic modes of motion as variables have successfully reconstructed detailed energy landscapes of several medium-size proteins. Here we investigate the extent to which one can reconstruct the energy landscape of a protein in the absence of sufficient, wet-laboratory structural data. We do so by integrating intrinsic modes of motion extracted off a single structure in a stochastic optimization framework that supports the plug-and-play of different variable selection strategies. We demonstrate that, while knowledge of more wet-laboratory structures yields better-reconstructed landscapes, precious information can be obtained even when only one structural model is available.

Motion Planning With Differential Constraints as Guided Search Over Continuous and Discrete Spaces,Erion Plaku,2012,Journal Proceedings of the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search,"To compute a motion trajectory that avoids collisions, reaches a goal region, and satisfies differential constraints imposed by robot dynamics, this paper proposes an approach that conducts a guided search over the continuous space of motions and over a discrete space obtained by a workspace decomposition. A tree of feasible motions and a frontier of workspace regions are expanded simultaneously by first determining the next region along which to expand the search and then using sampling-based motion planning to add trajectories to the tree to reach the selected region. When motion planning is not able to reach the selected region, its cost is increased so that the approach has the flexibility to expand the search along new regions. Comparisons to related work show significant computational speedups.",

A Hybrid Planning Framework for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"JW McMahon, B Dzikowicz, BH Houston, E Plaku","Introduction: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are a critical part of the Navy’s future in maintaining areas of undersea dominance such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. A truly autonomous system should be able to execute an overarching mission composed of multiple tasks without human intervention. To accomplish this, the system must possess a planning framework that can reason about high-level tasks or goals and generate a plan of corresponding low-level actions that fulfills an overall mission. Current state-of-the-art AUV planning approaches require a human operator to input each low-level action, rather than prescribing the mission at a high level. This imposes a heavy burden upon the user when generating complex mission specifications. As such, there is a great need for the creation of intuitive mission planning interfaces and an autonomy framework to automatically handle the organization of both high-and low-level actions to accomplish the user-defined mission.Here, we describe a new hybrid planning framework that generates plans accounting for highlevel mission specifications as well as the underlying dynamics of the AUV and its environment.

Structure-guided Protein Transition Modeling with a Probabilistic Roadmap Algorithm,"Erion Plaku, Amarda Shehu","Proteins are macromolecules in perpetual motion, switching between structural states to modulate their function. A detailed characterization of the precise yet complex relationship between protein structure, dynamics, and function requires elucidating transitions between functionally-relevant states. Doing so challenges both wet and dry laboratories, as protein dynamics involves disparate temporal scales. In this paper we present a novel, sampling-based algorithm to compute transition paths. The algorithm exploits two main ideas. First, it leverages known structures to initialize its search and define a reduced conformation space for rapid sampling. This is key to address the insufficient sampling issue suffered by sampling-based algorithms. Second, the algorithm embeds samples in a nearest-neighbor graph where transition paths can be efficiently computed via queries. The algorithm adapts the probabilistic roadmap framework that is popular in robot motion planning. In addition to efficiently computing lowest-cost paths between any given structures, the algorithm allows investigating hypotheses regarding the order of experimentally-known structures in a transition event. This novel contribution is likely to open up new venues of research. Detailed analysis is presented on multiple-basin proteins of relevance to human disease. Multiscaling and the AMBER ff14SB force field are used to obtain energetically-credible paths at atomistic detail.","Scholar articles Structure-guided Protein Transition Modeling with a Probabilistic Roadmap AlgorithmE Plaku, A ShehuRelated articles ","Proteins are macromolecules in perpetual motion, switching between structural states to modulate their function.

Solving the Inspection Problem via Colored Traveling Salesman Tours,"Stefan Edelkamp, Erion Plaku, Christoph Greulich, Mihai Pomarlan",Workshop on Task Planning for Intelligent Robots in Service and Manufacturing,Pages 26,"This paper describes an effective approach to solve the inspection problem via colored traveling salesman tours. Given an environment with obstacles and regions to be inspected, the approach plans a collision-free and dynamicallyfeasible motion trajectory that enables the vehicle to inspect all the regions of interest while reducing the distance traveled. A key aspect of the approach is the transformation of the inspection task into a colored traveling salesman problem (CTSP). This is achieved by generating a number of inspection points on the medial axis of each region in order to increase visibility and by grouping the inspection points according to their color. We also contribute a fast CTSP solver based on Monte-Carlo search to effectively find low-cost colored tours. Finally, a vehicle controller is employed in order to follow the planned tour. Experiments using different environments and inspection tasks provide promising validation.",

From Navigation to Robotic-Assisted Surgery: Combined Planning in Discrete and Continuous Spaces,Erion Plaku,"This work aims to deal formally and efficiently with the complexity of planning that arises at the intersection of Robotics and AI. Planning plays a crucial role as robots are deployed into unstructured environments and are expected to complete sophisticated tasks autonomously. At a fundamental level, planning requires computing discrete actions and continuous motions that enable the robot to accomplish a given task. Due to the complexity of the combined discrete and continuous planning problem, research has either focused on a discrete setting, as in AI, or in a continuous motion-planning context, as in Robotics. In AI, planning is generally reduced to computing a sequence of discrete actions that satisfies the task without taking into account robot dynamics, obstacle avoidance, and other physical constraints [Ghallab et al., 2004]. In Robotics, planning has focused on computing collision-free paths to the goal without taking into account sophisticated task specifications [Choset et al., 2005; LaValle, 2006]. The need for combined discrete and continuous planning, however, rises in many diverse applications ranging from navigation, manipulation, search-and-rescue, to game design, air-traffic control, and surgical procedures, since the tasks often involve abstractions into discrete, logical actions, where each action requires substantial continuous motion planning.
