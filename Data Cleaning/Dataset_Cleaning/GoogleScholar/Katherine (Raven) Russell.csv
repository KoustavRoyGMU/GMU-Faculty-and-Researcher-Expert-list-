Swarm robot foraging with wireless sensor motes,"Katherine Russell, Michael Schader, Kevin Andrea, Sean Luke",2015/5/4,Book Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,"We investigate the use of wireless sensor motes as mobile deployable waypoints for swarm robot navigation in a foraging scenario. Each robot can deploy, retrieve, and optimize the location of the sensor motes. After deployment, the robots treat the sensor motes as nodes in a sparse graph, and store and retrieve multiple pheromones and flags locally in each of them. Pheromone information stored in the sensor motes allows the robots to build up gradients to different targets of interest, and to determine which sensor motes are good candidates to optimize location, or to harvest for reuse elsewhere. Unlike many earlier pheromone-based foraging techniques, our method must deal with the physical reality of deploying and manipulating sensor motes, including a limited mote supply both onboard and in total, robustly dealing with occlusion and interference from other robots, and handling noise and robot or mote failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique both on differential drive robots of our own design, and in simulation, to examine its ability to robustly deal with various failure modes and changes in environment.",15
Evaluation of a geo-region based architecture for information centric disruption tolerant networks,"Katherine Russell, Robert Simon",2019/2/18,"Conference 2019 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)","Information Centric Disruption Tolerant Networks (ICDTNs) have recently been proposed as a powerful approach to provide effective data and information sharing when existing communication infrastructures are degraded or destroyed. This paper explores using a hybrid approach for ICDTN construction using Named Data Networking (NDN) and DTN architectures that avoids the need to heavily modify existing implementations. We analyze different design choices and argue that a geographically aware architecture is particularly effective for many ICDTN applications. To support this claim we evaluate “geo” versus “node” aware NDN implementations using a number of mobility models, network sizes, DTN forwarding methods, and caching in disaster scenarios. Our results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach with the appropriate selection of geo information, name advertisement and caching.",5
Toward a computational theory of evidence-based reasoning,"Gheorghe Tecuci, David Schum, Mihai Boicu, Dorin Marcu, Katherine Russell",2011/5/24,Journal Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Control Systems and Computer Science,"Evidence-based reasoning is at the core of many problem solving and decision making tasks in a wide variety of domains. Through abductive reasoning we generate hypotheses from our observations; through deductive reasoning we use our hypotheses to generate new lines of inquiry and discover new evidence; and through inductive reasoning we test our hypotheses with this discovered evidence. These processes, which integrate imaginative and critical reasoning, are often stunningly complex because our evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, ambiguous, dissonant, and has various degrees of believability. We present research performed in the Learning Agents Center of George Mason University on developing a Computational Theory of Evidence-based Reasoning viewed as mixed-initiative integration of evidence in search of hypotheses, hypotheses in search of evidence, and evidential tests of hypotheses, all taking place simultaneously, in a world that is changing all the time. This theory is embedded in the Disciple cognitive agents which are capable of capturing tacit knowledge from subject matter experts, and can act as assistants to experts, as expert consultants to non-experts, or as intelligent tutors to students. We illustrate the applications of these agents in various domains, including intelligence analysis and inquiry-based learning in natural sciences.",5
Efficient data advertisement in information centric disruption tolerant networks,"Katherine Russell, Robert Simon",2020/2/17,"Conference 2020 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)","Large-scale Information Centric Disruption Tolerant Networks (ICDTNs) are now being evaluated as a powerful system paradigm for data sharing when existing communication infrastructures are compromised. The effectiveness of an ICDTN is largely dependent upon efficient and scalable data advertising mechanisms, yet this problem has until recently not been extensively studied. This paper proposes a solution to the data advertising problem that is based upon random linear network coding. We show how to encode, decode, and use Named Data Networking advertising structures in an ICDTN environment. We have compared our approach to the standard flooding techniques under a variety of network sizes, communication conditions, node densities and mobility patterns. Our results show that our approach is both highly scalable and can significantly decrease the time for advertisement message delivery.",4
SHOWCASE: Managing Groups in Online Environments (90 mins),"Gabriele Belle, Victoria Grady, Karen King, Katie Rosenbusch, Raven Russell, Ashley Yuckenberg",2021/9/2,Journal Innovations in Teaching & Learning Conference Proceedings,"Managing groups in any learning environment requires careful planning to ensure that students feel included, develop important career-ready teamwork skills, and learn course subject content. In part one of this session, a panel of instructors from across disciplines will briefly share their team-based assignments and general strategies for assigning groups, managing group conflicts, grading group work, and providing groups feedback. In part two of this session, participants will experience an online group activity in which each group produces a slide in a shared document gallery that contains list of questions and strategies/tips for managing groups in online environments. In part three, speakers and participants engage in a discussion facilitated by the convener. Participants will be able to describe 3-8 strategies for managing groups in an online environment that they can apply to their courses.",
SHOWCASE: Online Class Meetings: Activities and Strategies to Engage Students (90 mins),"Nathan Kathir, Anya Evmenova, Gilbert Gimm, Ariel Goldenthal, Alison Melley, Jihye Moon, Raven Russell",2021/9/2,Journal Innovations in Teaching & Learning Conference Proceedings,"The purpose of this session is to make the attendees have increased confidence in teaching classes online and listen from experts that it can be fun, educational and engaging as well. Motivation for the talk is what happened to all of us in March 2020. Although select course have been delivered remotely before the arrival of pandemic in March 2020, all of us were required to teach online with a very short notice starting after the spring break in 2020. For many of us, this was the first time teaching remotely and had to learn the technical means of how to deliver the courses successfully and at the same time, to engage the students to stay attentive. Attendees in this session will hear from those who have had experience and mastered the online delivery of courses. The speakers will share lessons learned and activities designed to engage students to stay attracted to virtual classes.",
Large Scale Ad Hoc Information Centric Networks in Disrupted Environments,Katherine Russell,2020,Institution George Mason University,Information Centric Disruption Tolerant Networks (ICDTNs) have been forwarded as a new powerful approach to provide effective data and information sharing when existing communication infrastructures are degraded or destroyed. ICDTNSs can assist with communication infrastructure collapse and disaster response and aid is spreading vital information in a fast and reliable manner. This dissertation investigates the construction of very large (city-scale) ICDTNs without infrastructure support for such scenarios.,
Ant Geometers,"Bryan Hoyle, Katherine Russell, Sean Luke",2016/7/1,"Conference ALIFE 2016, the Fifteenth International Conference on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems","Just how much can a pheromone-enabled swarm do? Motivated by robotic construction, we set out to show that a swarm of computationally simple ants, communicating only via pheromones, can in fact perform classic compass-straightedge geometry, and thus can make many shapes and perform many nontrivial geometric tasks. The ants do not need specially-designed stigmergic building materials, a prepared environment, local or global direct communication facilities (such as radio or line-of-sight signaling), or any localization beyond initial starting points for drawing. We describe the proof of concept in replicable detail. We then note that its accuracy and efficiency can be greatly improved through augmentation with a simple embeddable broadcast mechanism.",
Portable Sensor Motes as a Distributed Communication Medium for Large Groups of Mobile Robots,"Sean Luke, Katherine Russell","We argue for the use of swarms of distributed portable sensors as a support medium for a large number of autonomous mobile robots. Because of the scaling issues inherent in their multiplicity, and because they may operate in broadcast-denied environments, swarm robot architectures often focus on local and “indirect” communication methods such as breadcrumbs, pheromones, or messages left in the environment. We are interested in how far we can go with these models in real robots. To this end, our research investigates robots capable of deploying, retrieving, moving, and locally communicating with many embedded sensor motes. The mobile agents deploy and optimize the location of the motes, read historic and current sensor data from them, and store useful local information in them for other mobile agents to discover later. We have demonstrated the ability to do robot foraging in environments with significant noise and physical disruption, such as might occur in any deployment of a large sensor network. We have also demonstrated experiments using swarms and sensor motes to collectively build sophisticated, non-trivial swarm behaviors, such as laying out complex shapes using compass/straightedge geometry. In this paper we discuss these results and their limitations, and indicate where we think wireless sensor mote technology can help advance swarm robotics going forward.","Scholar articles Portable Sensor Motes as a Distributed Communication Medium for Large Groups of Mobile RobotsS Luke, K RussellRelated articles All 2 versions ","We argue for the use of swarms of distributed portable sensors as a support medium for a large number of autonomous mobile robots.
