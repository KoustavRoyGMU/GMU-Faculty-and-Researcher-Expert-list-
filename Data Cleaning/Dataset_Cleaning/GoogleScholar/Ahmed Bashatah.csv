Classification performance and feature space characteristics in individuals with upper limb loss using sonomyography,"Susannah Engdahl, Ananya Dhawan, Ahmed Bashatah, Guoqing Diao, Biswarup Mukherjee, Brian Monroe, Rahsaan Holley, Siddhartha Sikdar",2022/1/6,Journal IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,"Objective : Sonomyography, or ultrasound-based sensing of muscle deformation, is an emerging modality for upper limb prosthesis control. Although prior studies have shown that individuals with upper limb loss can achieve successful motion classification with sonomyography, it is important to better understand the time-course over which proficiency develops. In this study, we characterized user performance during their initial and subsequent exposures to sonomyography.  Method : Ultrasound images corresponding to a series of hand gestures were collected from individuals with transradial limb loss under three scenarios: during their initial exposure to sonomyography (Experiment 1), during a subsequent exposure to sonomyography where they were provided biofeedback as part of a training protocol (Experiment 2), and during testing sessions held on different days (Experiment 3).

Motion prediction using electromyography and sonomyography for an individual with transhumeral limb loss,"Susannah Engdahl, Ananya Dhawan, György Lévay, Ahmed Bashatah, Rahul Kaliki, Siddhartha Sikdar",2020/12/26,Journal medRxiv,"Controlling multi-articulated prosthetic hands with surface electromyography can be challenging for users. Sonomyography, or ultrasound-based sensing of muscle deformation, avoids some of the problems of electromyography and enables classification of multiple motion patterns in individuals with upper limb loss. Because sonomyography has been previously studied only in individuals with transradial limb loss, the purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of an individual with transhumeral limb loss using this modality for motion classification. A secondary aim was to compare motion classification performance between electromyography and sonomyography. A single individual with transhumeral limb loss created two datasets containing 11 motions each (individual flexion of each finger, thumb abduction, power grasp, key grasp, tripod, point, pinch, wrist pronation). Electromyography or sonomyography signals associated with every motion were acquired and cross-validation accuracy was computed for each dataset. While all motions were usually predicted successfully with both electromyography and sonomyography, the cross-validation accuracies were typically higher for sonomyography. Although this was an exploratory study, the results suggest that controlling an upper limb prosthesis using sonomyography may be feasible for individuals with transhumeral limb loss.",3
First demonstration of functional task performance using a sonomyographic prosthesis: a case study,"Susannah M Engdahl, Samuel A Acuña, Erica L King, Ahmed Bashatah, Siddhartha Sikdar",2022,Journal Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Ultrasound-based sensing of muscle deformation, known as sonomyography, has shown promise for accurately classifying the intended hand grasps of individuals with upper limb loss in offline settings. Building upon this previous work, we present the first demonstration of real-time prosthetic hand control using sonomyography to perform functional tasks. An individual with congenital bilateral limb absence was fitted with sockets containing a low-profile ultrasound transducer placed over forearm muscle tissue in the residual limbs. A classifier was trained using linear discriminant analysis to recognize ultrasound images of muscle contractions for three discrete hand configurations (rest, tripod grasp, index finger point) under a variety of arm positions designed to cover the reachable workspace. A prosthetic hand mounted to the socket was then controlled using this classifier. Using this real-time sonomyographic …",1

"A Novel Method for Achieving Dexterous, Proportional Prosthetic Control using Sonomyography","Susannah Engdahl, Biswarup Mukherjee, Nima Akhlaghi, AnanyaDhawan Dhawan, Ahmed Bashatah, Shriniwas Patwardhan, Rahsaan Holley, Rahul Kaliki, Brian Monroe, Siddhartha Sikdar",2020/7/23,Journal MEC20 Symposium,"Although myoelectric upper limb prostheses have been commercially available for decades, many patients who receive these devices abandon them due to their limited functionality. Some of these functional limitations are related to the difficulties in sensing activity in different muscle compartments with surface electromyography. We believe it is possible to overcome the limitations of myoelectric control through use of sonomyography, or ultrasound-based sensing of muscle deformation. Sonomyography can better distinguish individual muscle activity and provides access to control signals that are directly proportional to muscle deformation, which has the potential to significantly improve prosthesis functionality. In this paper, we will describe our work towards developing a low-power wearable imaging system that will enable sonomyographically-controlled prostheses.",1

A miniature ultrasound M-Mode imaging system based on time delay spectrometry,"Ahmed Bashatah, Paul Otto, Biswarup Mukherjee, Parag V Chitnis, Siddhartha Sikdar",2021/10,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"For wearable ultrasound applications, power and safety are a concern. We have developed an imaging method based on time-delay spectrometry (TDS) that employs a low-voltage, wideband chirp to establish a relationship between reflector depth and frequency by mixing the transmit and receive signals. We will show a low power, 4 channel ultrasound M-Mode system capable of tracking in vivo muscle interfaces in the forearm. The battery powered imaging system consists of power regulation subsystem, a RF chirp subsystem, and four channels consisting of a transmit RF amplifier, a mixing unit, and a receive amplifier which are sampled at 40 KSPS by a processor with a four channel ADC. The processor performs an FFT on each demodulated return to get 4 scanlines that are tracked over time to produce M-Mode images that are sent to a host computer.

Measuring signal quality in low power wearable ultrasound imaging,"Samuel A Acuña, Ahmed Bashatah, Parag V Chitnis, Siddhartha Sikdar",2021/10,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) ultrasound is an emerging imaging method adapted from radar that can be implemented in wearable ultrasound systems due to the reduced size, power, and signal processing requirements. Acoustic reflections are encoded in the frequency domain, and thus evaluating signal quality currently requires extracting frequency information from a time-varying acquisition signal, which requires additional signal processing. Question: Can we differentiate FMCW ultrasound signal quality using an acquired FMCW time-series? We collected FMCW ultrasound images with a custom ultrasound transducer contacting and losing contact with tissue, to simulate moments of poor signal quality. We used two potential time-domain signal quality metrics: the mean absolute value (MAV) of the signal, and Sample Entropy. Sample Entropy is an information theory method for assessing …",
New applications of ultrasound-based muscle activity sensing for rehabilitation engineering,"Siddhartha Sikdar, Ahmed Bashatah, Joseph Majdi, Parag V Chitnis",2021/10,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"Traditionally, electromyography using surface electrodes has been the dominant method for sensing muscle activity. Major challenges with surface electromyography include the difficulty in resolving signals from overlying muscles and low signal to noise ratio. In recent years, ultrasound has been investigated as an alternative and complementary modality for sensing functional muscle activity that overcomes several limitations of surface electromyography. Ultrasound imaging can non-invasively resolve individual muscles, including deep and overlying muscles, and detect dynamic activity within different functional compartments in real-time. While the use of ultrasound in the biomechanics community has a long history, the continuing miniaturization of ultrasound instrumentation has opened up new opportunities for using ultrasound in rehabilitation engineering as a biosignal sensing modality for assistive devices …",

UITC ABSTRACTS 2021,"Rifat Ahmed, Nick Bottenus, James Long, David Bradway, Gregg Trahey","Objectives: Diffuse reverberation is a significant source of image degradation in abdominal ultrasound. Clutter induced by reverberation is often considered to be spatially incoherent. The nearest element correlation of backscatter signals provides a robust measure of such incoherent clutter [1]. We recently presented Lag-one Spatial Coherence Adaptive Normalization (LoSCAN)[2], an image formation technique that adaptively compensates for the SNR loss due to incoherent clutter. Here, we present in vivo LoSCAN images obtained with a 1024-element matrix array and explore the benefits of 2D clutter reduction.Methods: We developed a 2D LoSCAN framework applicable to matrix arrays. We validated this framework using Field II-simulated cyst phantoms of varying native contrasts and channel SNR, with a modeled 64x64 symmetric 2D array. Using these simulated data, we studied the impact of partially correlated noise (PCN) with controlled spatial correlation lengths (1λ to 3λ). Sub-aperture beamforming and a short-lag version of LoSCAN were explored as strategies to circumvent the PCN-induced contrast loss. We also acquired experimental data using a custom 64x16 2D array connected to a 1024-channel Verasonics system. We acquired fundamental and harmonic channel data from the liver of two healthy volunteers and performed 2D spatial coherence-based clutter analysis.Results: Compared to B-mode imaging, matrix LoSCAN preserved the native contrast and improved the lesion detectability, measured with the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR), over a wider range of channel SNR.
