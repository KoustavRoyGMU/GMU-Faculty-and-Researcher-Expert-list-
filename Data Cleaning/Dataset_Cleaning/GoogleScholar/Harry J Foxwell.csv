"Marvin: A web-based system for representing, retrieving, and visualizing analogies","Harry J Foxwell, Daniel A Menascé",2004/12,Journal World wide web,"Analogies are essential in human cognition, reasoning, learning, communication, and problem solving. They can have a profound and broad effect on how we view and understand our world. In this paper we discuss the design, implementation, and evaluation of MARVIN (Markup for Analogy Representation and Visualization for the InterNet), a Web-based system for representing, retrieving, and visualizing human-conceived analogies that provides a medium and a common language for analogy practitioners to share their analogies. We developed a compact XML content model for analogy expressions for use in Web-based environments, and show that the model is capable of representing a wide range of human-conceived analogies. We demonstrate, using XSLT, several example methods for visualizing analogy expressions that use our model. We demonstrate methods for storing and retrieving such …",15
Java 2 software development kit,Harry J Foxwell,1999/10/1,Journal Linux Journal,"New versions of the Java Development Kit and Java Virtual Machine are available first on Sun's systems and on Microsoft Windows, but many months may pass before they appear on other platforms. Sun's Java Software division produces reference implementations only for Solaris and for Windows, and licenses source code to other system vendors who want to port the JDK or JVM to their own hardware and operating systems.",10
Big data and cloud computing: A review of supply chain capabilities and challenges,"Marcus Tanque, Harry J Foxwell",2018,Source Exploring the Convergence of Big Data and the Internet of Things,"Big data and cloud computing are transforming information technology.

Prefetching results of web searches,"Harry J Foxwell, Daniel A Menascé",1998/12/6,Conference Int. CMG Conference,"Users of WWW search sites, such as Yahoo and Lycos, receive dynamically generated Web pages that list URL “hits”, or document links, whose contents match query keywords. Users then click on some or all of these links to inspect the document, at which time the server for the link transmits the file. This paper examines the behavior of users of Web search sites. Usage patterns are described for both simple and complex search queries; metrics are suggested for determining which search query results to prefetch in order to reduce network delays as seen by the client.",5
Pro OpenSolaris,"Harry Foxwell, Christine Tran",2009/4/26,Publisher Springer,"If you’re familiar with the UNIX operating system, perhaps you wonder what it will look like in the future given its long and varied history. We think it will look a lot like OpenSolaris, which is heavily influenced by the open source developer communities, especially by Linux developers.",2
"A Web-based system for representing, retrieving, and visualizing analogies",Harry J Foxwell,2003,Institution George Mason University,"Analogies are essential in human cognition, reasoning, learning, communication, and problem solving. They can have a profound and broad effect on how we view and understand our world. In this dissertation we design, implement, and evaluate a Web-based system for representing, retrieving, and visualizing human-conceived analogies that provides a medium and a common language for analogy practitioners to share their analogies. To accomplish this, we review the components of analogies, and develop a general representation of their structure. We then develop a compact XML content model of this representation for use in Web-based environments, and show that the model is capable of representing a wide range of human-conceived analogies. We demonstrate, using XSLT, several example methods for visualizing analogy expressions that use our model. We demonstrate methods for storing and …",2
The ZFS File System,"Harry J Foxwell, Christine Tran",2009,Journal Pro OpenSolaris: A New Open Source OS for Linux Developers and Administrators,"Stored data must be remembered perfectly. Many computer technologies have been invented in an attempt to achieve perfect data recall in the presence of electronic, mechanical, and human errors. RAID disk technologies, tape backup systems, error correcting memory, remote data replication, and other techniques are used today to ensure that when data is written it can be quickly and reliably retrieved even after much time has elapsed, perhaps years.",1
Web-Based Representation and Visualization of Analogies.,"Harry J Foxwell, Daniel A Menascé",2002,Conference ICWI,"Humans use analogies to communicate, reason, and learn. But while the human brain excels at creating and understanding analogies, it does not easily recall useful analogies created or learned over time. General purpose tools and methods are needed that assist humans in representing, storing, and recalling useful analogies. Additionally, such tools must take advantage of the World Wide Web's ubiquity, global reach, and universal standards. We first identify commonly occurring patterns of analogy structure. Because understanding of instructional analogies is significantly improved when their structure is visualized, we develop a compact and general representation for analogies using XML, and demonstrate general methods for visualizing the structure of analogy expressions in Web-based environments.",1

They will learn how to integrate a variety of teaching and learning strategies into their courses to help their students succeed in their classes and workforce.,
WORKSHOP: Active Learning Strategies for Online Teaching: From Lesson Plan to Program Development (90 mins),"Ioulia Rytikova, Mihai Boicu, Harry Foxwell, Amrita Jose",2020/7/31,Journal Innovations in Teaching & Learning Conference Proceedings,"Incorporating active learning strategies in online teaching involves several challenges both at the level of course development but also at the level of global program development. This session is co-organized by Dr. Ioulia Rytikova and Dr. Mihai Boicu and is building on the participants long-term successful experience in active learning, course and program development. In this roundtable/panel discussion we propose to analyze from various perspectives several challenges faced in this process, including: learning materials (from textbooks to open resources), classroom format (from mini-lectures to lighting talks), objective grading and personalized feedback (from detailed rubrics to automatic grading), student assessment (exams vs. quizzes), and assistive technology (from learning management systems to intelligent teaching assistants).",
Cleaning Your Data,"Harry J Foxwell, Harry J Foxwell",2020,Journal Creating Good Data: A Guide to Dataset Structure and Data Representation,"Okay, so you’ve read this book, learned how to create good data for your projects, and now all your new datasets are squeaky clean and ready for analysis! However, your research colleague borrowed the book but didn’t read it and now has a collection of messy datasets. Now what? Well, next we’ll learn about some methods for detecting bad data and for cleaning it up, often referred to as a component of “data munging” or “data wrangling.”",
Good Data Collection,"Harry J Foxwell, Harry J Foxwell",2020,Journal Creating Good Data: A Guide to Dataset Structure and Data Representation,"We have learned how to create good data items and dataset formats, focusing primarily on the characteristics of the individual data items and on the organization of the datasets. But there is a big issue not yet discussed – how to choose what data items to include in your research and how to collect appropriate values for those items. This process is fraught with danger – the danger of bias. Bias is the data collection killer; nothing will compromise the quality of your data more than bias. Biased data leads to incorrect results and faulty conclusions.",
Representing Quantitative Data,"Harry J Foxwell, Harry J Foxwell",2020,Journal Creating Good Data: A Guide to Dataset Structure and Data Representation,"In Chapter 2, we learned about four basic analytical data types. Quantitative data – interval and ratio – are among the most common types and are often the most problematic due to the great variety of measurement units and size ranges. Units vary by knowledge domain, usage conventions, national and historical origins, and formal or organizational standards. Sizes range from the infinitesimal to the cosmic in fields like economics, computer science, quantum physics, and astronomy. Ensuring good quantitative data requires selection and recording of appropriate units and defining them in the data dictionary for the dataset and avoiding any unit labels in the data itself. In this chapter, we review how common quantities and measurements are expressed and caution how mixing unit types can cause time-consuming data cleanup tasks.",
Planning Your Data Collection and Analysis,"Harry J Foxwell, Harry J Foxwell",2020,Journal Creating Good Data: A Guide to Dataset Structure and Data Representation,"Chapter 2 emphasized that data types are classified according to their purpose, and Chapter 3 cautioned you about the myriad ways that measurements can be represented. Recall that the general purpose of data analysis is to describe some phenomenon, to explore some potentially informative relationships among the data items, and to model and predict the behavior of that phenomenon. And the inception of your inspiration to study it in the first place implies that you have some sense of what might be useful to measure and what relationships might be lurking in the data. This means you need to think carefully about what to measure and how to measure it. And this does not mean that you ignore potential biases or unfounded assumptions about the focus of your research. Anticipating the tools and methods of your analysis does not mean presupposing anything about your as-yet-uncollected data, but it does …",
Basic Data Types and When to Use Them,"Harry J Foxwell, Harry J Foxwell",2020,Journal Creating Good Data: A Guide to Dataset Structure and Data Representation,Decisions about how to represent data measurements for your research projects have important consequences – they directly determine what kinds of statistical and visualization methods can ultimately be used for analysis and presentation of your results. This means you need to select representation types thoughtfully with your analytical goals in mind while at the same time trying to avoid any form of bias in what you decide to measure and what you anticipate your data exploration and analysis tasks will look like.,
Dataset Examples and Use Cases,"Harry J Foxwell, Harry J Foxwell",2020,Journal Creating Good Data: A Guide to Dataset Structure and Data Representation,"To illustrate some of the practices we learned about in the preceding chapters, let’s have a brief look at the characteristics of a few example datasets. We will examine some well-known datasets that pop up regularly in data analytics courses and textbooks for teaching about visualization, regression modeling, machine learning, and other data exploration methods. There are literally thousands of online datasets hosted by independent researchers, government agencies, corporations, and academics. These online datasets vary widely in the completeness and quality of their metadata and of the data itself and are worth reviewing for their ranges of “goodness.”",
Good Data Analytics,"Harry J Foxwell, Harry J Foxwell",2020,Journal Creating Good Data: A Guide to Dataset Structure and Data Representation,"You’ve completed your research activities, collected (and cleaned) your dataset, and you’re ready to figure out what all that data means. Congratulations, you’ve been promoted to data analyst! Now your job is to extract actionable knowledge from it, for you and for your readers/clients, from that massive pile of numbers and symbols. But now is not the time to just get started thinking about your analysis. As we have emphasized in the previous chapters, you need to plan your analysis requirements long before collecting your data, with the goal of starting with good data.",
Good Datasets,"Harry J Foxwell, Harry J Foxwell",2020,Journal Creating Good Data: A Guide to Dataset Structure and Data Representation,"In the previous chapters, we learned about data items (analysis variables) – the components and contents of datasets. But a major decision for your research is how that data is to be formatted and stored and especially how to make it easy to analyze and share. Poorly designed and implemented datasets are just as problematic as any bad data they might contain. It’s hard to get good data out of bad datasets, and that can make life difficult for other analysts who want to use your data.",
The Intersection of Data Analytics and Data-Driven Innovation,"Marcus Tanque, Harry J Foxwell",2020,Book AI and Big Data’s Potential for Disruptive Innovation,"This chapter discusses businesses, key technology implementations, case studies, limitations, and trends. It also presents recommendations to improve data analysis, data-driven innovation, and big data project implementation. Small-to-large-scale project inefficiencies present unique challenges to both public and private sector institutions and their management. Data analytics management, data-driven innovation, and related project initiatives have grown in scope, scale, and frequency. This evolution is due to continued technological advances in analytical methods and computing technologies. Most public and private sector organizations do not deliver on project benefits and results. Many organizational and managerial practices emphasize these technical limitations. Specialized human and technical resources are essential for an organization's effective project completion. Functional and practical areas …",
The Need for Good Data,"Harry J Foxwell, Harry J Foxwell",2020,Journal Creating Good Data: A Guide to Dataset Structure and Data Representation,"Learning about data analytics tools and methods typically begins with discussions of how to prepare a given dataset for analysis. The reason for this is that many datasets have problems – defects in design, missing or incorrect data items, and non-standard file formats. This often leads to lengthy and complex tasks required to produce datasets ready for efficient analysis. Unfortunately, the critical first step – understanding the nature of data representation – is frequently missing or not sufficiently addressed in resources about data analytics, especially for practitioners just starting their technical careers. Thus, in this chapter, we start with the detailed understanding of data – what it is, how it is expressed, and what we mean by “good” and “bad” data. Only by basing your analyses on good data will you produce trustworthy interpretations of your research, leading to good decisions and knowledge-based actions. Let’s get …",
Cyber Resilience for the Internet of Things,"Marcus Tanque, Harry J Foxwell",2018,Book Handbook of Research on Information and Cyber Security in the Fourth Industrial Revolution,"This chapter examines and explains cyber resilience, internet of things, software-defined networking, fog computing, cloud computing, and related areas. Organizations develop these technologies in tandem with cyber resilience best practices, such as processes and standards. Cyber resilience is at the intersection of cyber security and business resilience. Its core capabilities encompass integrated strategic policies, processes, architectures, and frameworks. Governments and industries often align defensive and resilient capabilities, to address security and network vulnerability breaches through strategic management processes.",
SMF: The Service Management Facility,"Harry J Foxwell, Christine Tran",2009,Journal Pro OpenSolaris: A New Open Source OS for Linux Developers and Administrators,"Much of modern computer hardware is self-monitoring and self-correcting. It tests itself and reports real and impending errors so that preemptive maintenance can be performed, often in the form of “hot swap” components that can be replaced without interrupting system activity. What would a similar approach to system software look like? It would need a framework for identifying and classifying services and their dependencies, for monitoring and reporting their status, and for some form of autorecovery. UNIX has historically lacked such a framework, relying instead on ad hoc solutions to determine which services are running, which services are not running that should be and why, and which potential services are available.",
The Advantages of Developing with OpenSolaris,"Harry J Foxwell, Christine Tran",2009,Journal Pro OpenSolaris: A New Open Source OS for Linux Developers and Administrators,"Netscape founder Marc Andreessen somewhat famously remarked in 2006 that “Solaris is a better Linux than Linux.” That comment raised a bit of ire from many Linux proponents, but what he was referring to at the time was Solaris 10’s excellent reputation for code quality, reliability, performance, and scalability. OpenSolaris inherits those characteristics.",
Introducing OpenSolaris,"Harry J Foxwell, Christine Tran",2009,Journal Pro OpenSolaris: A New Open Source OS for Linux Developers and Administrators,"Welcome, open source solution developers! If you’ve purchased and are reading this book (thanks!) or if you’re scanning it in the bookstore (please keep reading!), you probably think of yourself as a “Solaris developer” or a “Linux developer.” You Solaris users, administrators, and developers may already know that as Sun Microsystems’ commercial version of Solaris continues to evolve, it will look more and more like today’s OpenSolaris, so it’s great that you’ve chosen this book to learn more about it.",
Getting and Installing OpenSolaris,"Harry J Foxwell, Christine Tran",2009,Journal Pro OpenSolaris: A New Open Source OS for Linux Developers and Administrators,"Linux has a justifiably good reputation for being easy to install, and that process has become even easier and with more useful options since Schwartz’s report so long ago. On the other hand, Sun’s Solaris for x86 systems has had a reputation, also somewhat deserved, of being difficult to install and configure, along with doubts as to whether it would run at all on any randomly chosen “commodity” laptop, workstation, or server. But the world has indeed changed. As we pointed out in Chapter 2, Solaris and OpenSolairs run on thousands of differently configured Intel and AMD systems; installation of Solaris and now OpenSolaris has been steadily improving using the same boot technologies and methods found in Linux distributions. Yes, now OpenSolaris is also easy to install.",
Innovative OpenSolaris Features,"Harry J Foxwell, Christine Tran",2009,Journal Pro OpenSolaris: A New Open Source OS for Linux Developers and Administrators,"In the previous chapters, we covered much of the basics of installing and configuring OpenSolaris and using its unique features to develop AMP stack-based web applications. But there is so much more to explore. In this chapter, we’ll introduce you to the DTrace observability tool for monitoring and discovering application and OS behavior. Then we’ll wrap up with a look at a selection of other OpenSolaris features such as the Distribution Constructor, Tracker, Device Driver Utility, SongBird, and some key educational resources.",
A Development Environment on Opensolaris,"Harry J Foxwell, Christine Tran",2009,Journal Pro OpenSolaris: A New Open Source OS for Linux Developers and Administrators,"Not terribly long ago, if a developer had wanted to load a development environment on her laptop, she could count on spending half a day building the operating system and another half a day getting and loading her tools, compilers, scripting languages, and database. If she were a casual tinkerer or a beginner, add another day for figuring out where all the knobs are and reading the manuals. By the time she’s ready to get down to business, her flash of inspiration may well have smoldered down to embers, or worse, the idea of having to go through with the build is so wearying that our budding developer chucks it all in disgust.",
OpenSolaris and Virtualization,"Harry J Foxwell, Christine Tran",2009,Journal Pro OpenSolaris: A New Open Source OS for Linux Developers and Administrators,"Virtualization is a very broad and somewhat overused term that now encompasses a great number of different technologies. The basic ideas and implementations date back to the early days of mainframe computers in the 1960s when such systems were large, expensive, and scarce resources. In order to efficiently use these systems for multiple simultaneous computational tasks, techniques were developed to provide separate execution environments for individual workloads, including support for different operating systems. These execution environments provided performance and security boundaries through both hardware and software containment methods. To do this in software, indirect abstractions were created for access to system resources such as CPUs, memory, disks, and network interfaces. These abstractions are called virtual resources, which is where the term virtualization originates.",
A Familiar User and Developer Environment and More,"Harry J Foxwell, Christine Tran",2009,Journal Pro OpenSolaris: A New Open Source OS for Linux Developers and Administrators,"Long before Sun Microsystems even thought about OpenSolaris, it recognized the benefits of community-developed desktop environments such as KDE and GNOME, especially since many Sun engineers contributed extensively to these systems. GNOME was selected as the default Solaris desktop, replacing the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) originally developed by the corporate consortium comprising IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Novell, and Sun. GNOME is now standard on most UNIX and Linux systems, and GNOME 2.24 is the current default desktop for OpenSolaris (Figure 4-1).",
