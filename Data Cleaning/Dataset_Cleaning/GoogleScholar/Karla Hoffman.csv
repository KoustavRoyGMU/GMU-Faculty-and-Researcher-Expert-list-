Solving airline crew scheduling problems by branch-and-cut,"Karla L Hoffman, Manfred Padberg",1993/6,Journal Management science,The crew scheduling problem is one that has been studied almost continually for the past 40 years but all prior approaches have always approximated the problem of finding an optimal schedule for even the smallest of an airline's fleets. The problem is especially important today since costs for flying personnel of major U.S. carriers have grown and now often exceed $1.3 billion a year and are the second largest item (next to fuel cost) of the total operating cost of major U.S. carriers. Thus even small percentage savings amount to substantial dollar amounts. We present a branch-and-cut approach to solving to proven optimality large set partitioning problems arising within the airline industry. We first provide some background related to this important application and then describe the approach for solving representative problems in this problem class. The branch-and-cut solver generates cutting planes based on the …,790
Traveling salesman problem,"Karla L Hoffman, Manfred Padberg, Giovanni Rinaldi",2013/1,Journal Encyclopedia of operations research and management science,"The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one which has commanded much attention of mathematicians and computer scientists specifically because it is so easy to describe and so difficult to solve. The problem can simply be stated as: if a traveling salesman wishes to visit exactly once each of a list of m cities (where the cost of traveling from city i to city j is cij) and then return to the home city, what is the least costly route the traveling salesman can take? A complete historical development of this and related problems can be found in Hoffman and Wolfe (1985), Applegate et al.(2006), and Cook (2011).",339

Improving LP-representations of zero-one linear programs for branch-and-cut,"Karla L Hoffman, Manfred Padberg",1991/5,Journal ORSA Journal on Computing,"We present various techniques for automatically improving the LP-representation of general zero-one linear programming problems. These include detection of redundant rows and blatant infeasibilities, coefficient reduction using the Euclidean algorithm, optimality fixing and variable elimination. Extensions to the case where special-ordered-set constraints are present are discussed as well. A summary of the branch-and-cut approach to general zero-one problems (including flowcharts) is given. We report numerical experiments to test the effect of such preprocessing within a branch-and-cut algorithm for eleven large-scale real-world zero-one linear-programming problems.

A method for globally minimizing concave functions over convex sets,Karla Leigh Hoffman,1981/12,Journal mathematical Programming,"A method is described for globally minimizing concave functions over convex sets whose defining constraints may be nonlinear. The algorithm generates linear programs whose solutions minimize the convex envelope of the original function over successively tighter polytopes enclosing the feasible region. The algorithm does not involve cuts of the feasible region, requires only simplex pivot operations and univariate search computations to be performed, allows the objective function to be lower semicontinuous and nonseparable, and is guaranteed to converge to the global solution. Computational aspects of the algorithm are discussed.",178
"Auctions for the safe, efficient, and equitable allocation of airspace system resources","Michael Ball, George Donohue, Karla Hoffman",2006,Journal Combinatorial auctions,"In this paper, we present evidence of the need for the specification of property rights associated with airport departure and arrival time slots and then provide the rationale and means for using auctions to allocate such property rights. We provide a historical look at slot allocation in the US and the consequences of prior and current practices on both safety and competition. It is shown that the particular characteristics of aviation slot allocation suggest the need for three types of market mechanisms: an auction of longterm leases of arrival and/or departure slots, a market that supports inter-airline exchange of long-term leases and a near-real-time market that allows for the exchange of slots on a particular day of operation. We describe how certain concepts and tools underlying Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) provide a natural basis for developing the nearreal-time market and present a broad overview of the special characteristics of aviation slot auctions and appropriate research topics.",170
Estimating domestic US airline cost of delay based on European model,"John Ferguson, Abdul Qadar Kara, Karla Hoffman, Lance Sherry",2013/8/1,Journal Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,"Researchers are applying more holistic approaches to the feedback control of the air transportation system. Many of these approaches rely on economic feedback, including the cost of delays to the airlines. Establishing an accurate mechanism for estimating the cost of a delays for each portion of a flight (gate costs, taxiing in and out costs, and en-route costs) is useful for many aspects of modeling airline behavior and for better understanding the likely impact of regulations. Cook et al. (2004) developed a rigorous methodology and collected data for estimating the components of airline delay costs for various segments of a scheduled flight. The model, based on confidential information from European airlines for 12 types of aircraft ca. 2003, was not transparent with regards to how each of the major components of cost (crew costs, fuel costs, maintenance, depreciation, etc.) impacted that total.

Modeling the IRS telephone taxpayer information system,"Carl M Harris, Karla L Hoffman, Patsy B Saunders",1987/8,Source Operations Research,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) toll-free, nationwide telephone system provides prompt tax-information assistance. In 1986, the IRS processed 37.8 million calls from taxpayers at 32 answering sites. This paper documents a critical review of the IRS approach to allocating its staff and equipment. We built a simulation-based model to test various allocation policies for deploying IRS resources. The simulation study included detailed sensitivity analysis on key network variables, and showed the feasibility of modeling a typical IRS location as a multiserver loss/delay queue with retrial and reneging. The second phase of this effort therefore centered around developing a prototype probabilistic model for determining the most effective way of providing service at reasonable levels and at minimum cost. The resulting model allows the IRS to determine from tables the best configuration of people and telephone lines for …",85
Market-based alternatives for managing congestion at new york’s laguardia airport,"Michael O Ball, Lawrence M Ausubel, Frank Berardino, Peter Cramton, George Donohue, Mark Hansen, Karla Hoffman",2007,"Publisher AirNeth Annual Conference, The Hague","In the paper, we summarize the results of a project that was motivated by the expiration of the “High Density Rule,” which defined the slot controls employed at New York’s LaGuardia Airport for more than 30 years. The scope of the project included the analysis of several administrative measures, congestion pricing options and slot auctions. The research output includes a congestion pricing procedure and also the specification of a slot auction mechanism. The research results are based in part on two strategic simulations. These were multi-day events that included the participation of airport operators, most notably the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, FAA and DOT executives, airline representatives and other members of the air transportation community. The first simulation placed participants in a stressful, high congestion future scenario and then allowed participants to react and problem solve under various administrative measures and congestion pricing options. The second simulation was a mock slot auction in which participants bid on LGA arrival and departure slots for fictitious airlines.",70
Large-scale 0–1 linear programming on distributed workstations,"Timothy L Cannon, Karla L Hoffman",1990/12,Journal Annals of Operations Research,"We present a methodology which uses a collection of workstations connected by an Ethernet network as a parallel processor for solving large-scale linear programming problems.

Concave minimization via collapsing polytopes,"James E Falk, Karla L Hoffman",1986/12,Journal Operations Research,"We present a procedure for globally minimizing a concave function over a (bounded) polytope by successively minimizing the function over polytopes containing the feasible region, and collapsing to the feasible region.

The method generates a tree whose ultimate terminal nodes coincide with the vertices of the feasible region, and accounts for the vertices of the containing polytopes.",50
OR PRACTICE—The dance of the thirty-ton trucks: Dispatching and scheduling in a dynamic environment,"Martin Durbin, Karla Hoffman",2008/2,Journal Operations research,"We report on the application of operations research to a very complex scheduling and dispatching problem. Scheduling and dispatching are never easy, but the scheduling of concrete deliveries is particularly difficult for several reasons: (1) concrete is an extremely perishable product—it can solidify in the truck if offloading is delayed by a few hours; (2) customer orders are extremely unpredictable and volatile—orders are often canceled or drastically changed at the last minute; (3) the concrete company overbooks by as much as 20% to compensate for customer unpredictability; (4) many orders require synchronized deliveries by multiple trucks; (5) when a truck arrives at a customer site, the customer may not be ready for the delivery, or a storm may negate the ability to use the concrete; and (6) most of the travel takes place in highly congested urban areas, making travel times highly variable.",47
Integer and combinatorial optimization,"Karla L Hoffman, Ted K Ralphs",2013,Journal Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science,"Integer optimization problems are concerned with the efficient allocation of limited resources to meet a desired objective when some of the resources in question can only be divided into discrete parts. In such cases, the divisibility constraints on these resources, which may be people, machines, or other discrete inputs, may restrict the possible alternatives to a finite set. Nevertheless, there are usually too many alternatives to make complete enumeration a viable option for instances of realistic size. For example, an airline may need to determine crew schedules that minimize the total operating cost; an automotive manufacturer may want to determine the optimal mix of models to produce in order to maximize profit; or a flexible manufacturing facility may want to schedule production for a plant without knowing precisely what parts will be needed in future periods. In today’s changing and competitive industrial environment, the difference between ad hoc planning methods and those that use sophisticated mathematical models to determine an optimal course of action can determine whether or not a company survives.",44

Estimation of a caller retrial rate for a telephone information system,"Karla L Hoffman, Carl M Harris",1986/10/1,Journal European Journal of Operational Research,"As part of a continuing study of the usage of its Taxpayer Service Telephone Network, the US Internal Revenue Service wished to determine more accurate methods for demand measurement. It has long been recognized that the total number of calls coming into such a busy telephone system overestimates the actual number of distinct callers. The Service had previously estimated its real demand by adding (1 3) of both the number of blocked or overflow calls and the number of abandonments to the total actually answered. The thrust of this current study then was to develop an accurate statistical method for providing a more objective formula for this true demand, which turns out to be equivalent to estimating the probability of retrial by blocked and abandoned callers. The major result which has come from this effort is that the average daily retrial percentage taken across location and time of year seems to be …",42

Optimum airport capacity utilization under congestion management: A case study of New York LaGuardia airport,"Loan Le, George Donohue, Karla Hoffman, Chun-Hung Chen",2008/2/1,Journal Transportation Planning and Technology,"Abstract In the United States, most airports do not place any limitations on airline schedules. At a few major airports, the current scheduling restrictions (mostly administrative measures) have not been sufficiently strict to avoid consistent delays and have raised debates about both the efficiency and the fairness of the allocations. With a forecast of 1.1 billion yearly air travelers within the US by 2015, airport expansion and technology enhancement alone are not enough to cope with the competition-driven scheduling practices of the airline industry. The policy legacy needs to change to be consistent with airport capacities. Flights on US airlines arrived late more often in the first four months of 2007 than in any other year since the government began tracking delays, and flight cancellations increased 91% over 2006.

Testing linear pricing algorithms for use in ascending combinatorial auctions,"Melissa Dunford, Karla Hoffman, Dinesh Menon, Rudy Sultana, Thomas Wilson",2007,Journal INFORMS Journal on Computing,"In a one-sided ascending combinatorial auction, bidders place bids on packages of items. When values are interdependent, multi-round auctions are employed to allow price discovery. In such designs, bidders desire feedback on the estimated prices of items and packages in each round. In addition, prices are often used to set the minimum acceptable bid amounts for the next round. Due to the combinatorial nature of the winner determination problem, determining the prices of the individual items is not straightforward. The ascending proxy auction (Ausubel-Milgrom, 2001) has been proposed as a design, where the minimum acceptable bid amounts are a very small increment above the previous high bid on an item or package. These translate to nonlinear and non-anonymous (bidder specific) pricing. When agents are substitutes and the buyer sub-modularity condition is satisfied, the ascending proxy design achieves an efficient outcome at minimum competitive equilibrium prices. But the requirement for an infinitesimally small increment size, results in an auction with a very large number of rounds. In this paper, we propose two alternative linearpricing schemes that use the game-theoretic concept of the nucleolus to provide price estimates for each item and to determine minimum acceptable bid amounts. We study the effects of such pricing on the length of the auction, the efficiency of the outcome and the prices paid by the winning bidders. We use the linear pricing schemes in an ascending proxy auction framework and benchmark the results against an ascending proxy auction and a faster-to-compute variant of this algorithm that we label the …",29

Observations and near-direct implementations of the ascending proxy auction,"Karla Hoffman, Dinesh Menon, Susara van den Heever, Thomas Wilson",2006,Journal Combinatorial Auctions,"In Chapter 3, the ascending proxy auction mechanism of Ausubel and Milgrom (2002) is described, and its proven desirable economic properties are presented. However, major obstacles arise in its practical implementation. The primary implementation obstacles are that the mechanism requires a bidder to explicitly enumerate all combinations of interest (for more on communications requirements see Chapter 11), and that the mechanism theoretically assumes very small incremental increases in the minimum acceptable bid prices for each of the proxy rounds. This chapter is concerned with the calculation of the final price calculation without the need to perform all of the calculations associated with a direct implementation of the ascending proxy algorithm, since the number of rounds that would be required to complete such a direct implementation would be very large when a high level of accuracy is desired. For example, using an increment of $1,000 in a simulated auction of only 10 bidders and six licenses where the auction terminated at about $3.5 million (starting at initial prices of $0), the total number of rounds in the ascending proxy auction was often over 3,000.

Analysis of air transportation for the new york metroplex: Summer 2007,"Liya Wang, George Donohue, Karla Hoffman, Lance Sherry, Rosa Oseguera-Lohr",2008/6,Journal International Conference on Research in Air Transportation (ICRAT 2008),"The New York metroplex airports (JFK, LGA, EWR) provide air transportation service to this critical international economic hub. In the summer of 2007 the flights servicing the NYC metroplex airports experienced excessive delays and cancellations that added significant costs to doing business in New York. These delays can be attributed to changes in daily airport capacity (due to weather) and to airline practices, in accordance with regulations, of scheduling in excess of airport capacity. Previous research has demonstrated that maintaining airline seat capacity by increasing aircraft size and reducing frequency is an economically efficient and feasible solution. This paper analyzes the characteristics of the air transportation service to the New York metroplex airports. The metroplex has service to 109 domestic airports. Thirty six percent of airports serve all three New York airports, while 35% serve two of the airports. For the airports that serve all three NY airports, the average number of flights per day is 24 with a maximum of 60. These flights have an average seat size ranging from 41 to 178 with an average of 91 seats per flight. During the summer of 2007, these flights had passenger load factors ranging from 53% to 91% with an average of 71%. This yields an average of 633 unused seats per day on these routes. Additional statistics and discussion of these results on the implications for consolidation of service with larger aircraft and reduced frequency is discussed.",18

A column-generation and branch-and-cut approach to the bandwidth-packing problem,"Christine Villa, Karla Hoffman",2006/3,Journal Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology,"The telecommunications problem of assigning calls with point to point demand to a capacitated network where each call can be assigned to at most one path has been called the Bandwidth-Packing Problem.

Preliminary testing suggests that the use of this tool may significantly simplify bidders’ efforts in generating packages of interest, and thus lead to more efficient auction outcomes.",13

Effects of fuel prices on air transportation performance at New York and San Francisco airports,"John Ferguson, Karla Hoffman, Lance Sherry, Abdul Qadar Kara",2009/5/13,"Conference 2009 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference","Industry strategists, government regulators, and the media have focused on addressing concerns over the performance of the air transportation system with respect to delays. One of the strategies proposed has been to limit the scheduled operations at an airport to a priori feasible capacity limits.

This paper describes a comparison of the behavior of the air transportation system (e.g. markets, economics, and performance) during the recent run-up in fuel prices at slot-controlled New York airports and non-slot controlled San Francisco airports. The results indicate that slot controlled airports yielded improved performance (e.g. less delayed and cancelled flights) through reductions in frequency and de-peaking schedules.

We propose a new, two-sided, multiple-round, combinatorial clock exchange mechanism that enables traders to specify reserve prices and submit consolidated bundle orders on spectrum assets to be bought and sold. Any trader may submit multiple orders over several rounds. A trading agent's order can only be executed when it matches with bids and asks from one or more other agents. Acceptable bid and ask prices are adjusted each round to decrease the spread, and the final, market-clearing trades are executed to maximize the gains from trade. This paper outlines the clock mechanism and presents a new approach for allocation of surplus among the market-clearing agents to maximize incentives for participation.",9

Obtaining minimum-correlation Latin Hypercube Sampling plans using an IP-based heuristic,"Carl M Harris, Karla L Hoffman, Leslie-Ann Yarrow",1995/6,Journal Operations-Research-Spektrum,"The objective of Latin Hypercube Sampling is to determine an effective procedure for sampling from a (possibly correlated) multivariate population to estimate the distribution function (or at least a significant number of moments) of a complicated function of its variables. The typical application involves a computer-based model in which it is largely impossible to find a way (closed form or numerical) to do the necessary transformation of variables and where it is expensive to run in terms of computing resources and time. Classical approaches to hypercube sampling have used sophisticated stratified sampling techniques; but such sampling may provide incorrect measures of the output parameters' variances or covariances due to correlation between the sampling pairs. In this work, we offer a strategy which provides a sampling specification minimizing the sum of the absolute values of the pairwise differences …",9

Efficient solution methods for the cumulative-interference channel assignment problem using integer optimization and constraint programming,"Paul J Nicholas, Karla L Hoffman",2019,"Conference Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research: 16th International Conference, CPAIOR 2019, Thessaloniki, Greece, June 4–7, 2019, Proceedings 16","Interest in the channel assignment problem (CAP) has been growing rapidly with both the spread of wireless data networks and the increasing scarcity of electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The ability to efficiently reuse available EM channels is heavily dependent on co-channel interference, i.e., interference occurring between two radios using the same channel but not communicating on the same network. The vast majority of CAP research considers only the interference between any pair of radios, but many radio systems – including the mobile ad-hoc networks we consider – are sensitive to the effects of cumulative interference. In previous work, we describe the vast computational challenges of considering cumulative interference within a CAP. We present a new method to solve this problem via heuristics, integer optimization, and constraint programming techniques. We apply our methods to realistic data …",3
Using an equilibrium model to forecast airline behavior in response to economic or regulatory changes,"John Ferguson, Karla Hoffman, Lance Sherry, George Donohue, Abdul Qadar Kara, Rosa Oseguera-Lohr",2011/5/10,"Conference 2011 Integrated Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance Conference Proceedings","Government and industry are exploring approaches, such as technology (e.g. SESAR/NextGen) and market-based methods, to address the pervasive delays in the air transportation system.

This study uses delay-cost modeling to explain such behavior. This paper extends our previous analysis of airline delay costs by applying that methodology to new data and examining the sensitivity of the results to such data changes. We examine the sensitivity of airline delay costs to aircraft fuel burn rates, fuel prices, crew and maintenance costs, and airline market shares.

EvidEncE that airport pricing Works,"George L Donohue, Karla Hoffman",2007/11/1,"Journal Policy Brief, Reason Foundation","Congestion pricing as applied to runway allocation would result in the price of an arrival or departure time slot varying by time of day and day of week, and the prices would dynamically change as the demand for operations changes over time. Congestion pricing of transport networks has been common in road traffic. Examples include traditional tolling as well as more dynamic electronic-charges to users such as those used in London [4], in Trondheim, Norway [5], Singapore [6], Toronto’s Highway 407, and SR 91 and I-15 HOT lanes in California. The airlines would find congestion prices that were set at day-of-operations (as in road pricing) difficult to manage, since their schedules are announced 90 days in advance. Thus, unlike individual drivers, airlines should not be encouraged to cancel flights at the last minute due to high arrival costs. For this reason, we considered a congestion management approach whereby the prices are announced 120 days in advance, and the airlines base their schedules on these announced prices (see Daniel [7], Pels [8], Fan [9], and Schank [10], and Berardino [11] for more on runway congestion pricing). An alternative to congestion pricing is the allocation of slots by auction for a much longer period of time. The buyer has, in essence, leased the right to a given takeoff or landing and can use or re-sell that right for any portion of the lease period. The airlines bid for the right to land and/or depart at a given time. Proposals to allocate airport time slots using marketdriven mechanisms such as auctions date back to 1979 with the work of Grether, Issac, and Plot [13] and Rassenti, Smith and Bulfin [14].

We also explore the effect of creating “best-fit” packages at each round. Our preliminary results show that the use of this tool may significantly simplify bidders’ efforts in generating packages of interest and lead to efficient auction outcomes.",2

A Micro-Economic Model of Airline Choice of Airfare and Aircraft Size in the Presence of Changing Energy Costs,"Lance Sherry, George Donohue",2013,"Book 2013 Aviation Technology, Integration, and Operations Conference","INCE deregulation of the US domestic airline marketplace in 1978, the airline firms directly determine the structure of the airline transportation network: the markets served, the frequency of service, the airfare, and the aircraft size (ie number of seats). These decisions directly affect regional and national commerce, and determine the degree of equity in geographic access (eg service to rural communities) and the degree of equity in economic access (eg access across the socio-economic spectrum) provided by the transportation system. Understanding the dynamics of the network structure is critical to decision-making related to transportation policies, climate change and environmental policies, aircraft fleet size manufacturing, airline fleet planning, and aeronautics research.

Comparison of efficiency of slot allocation by congestion pricing and ration by schedule,"Saba Neyshabouri, Vivek Kumar, Lance Sherry, Karla Hoffman",2012/4/24,"Conference 2012 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference","When airport arrival slots are scheduled in excess of the available capacity, the scheduled flights are assigned slots by a rationing scheme. The traditional approach is to ration slots by schedule (RBS) on a first-scheduled/first-assigned basis. This approach, although meeting equity criteria, can result in inefficient use of the arrival slots in terms of passenger throughput and fuel burn; however, it does not reflect the business decisions with respect to the value of a given flight to an airline. An alternative approach is to allocate the slots based on an airlines' willingness-to-pay a congestion fee, set a priori by a regulator, for use of the slot.

The objective is to maximize the revenue that is obtained by routing the chosen calls. If call splitting is allowed, then a multi-commodity flow formulation can be used. However, we are concerned with the situation where call splitting is not allowed, as with video data. Without call splitting, the problem requires that one know the paths upon which the calls are routed. There are many possible paths for each call.

Solution Procedures for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization,Karla L Hoffman,1993/8/31,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA,"Results of research performed under this grant have shown that problems having thousands, and sometimes millions, of variables can be solved using present-day technology based on mathematical results that utilize the structure underlying the problem and that incorporate related advances of the mathematical theory into a general approach called branch-and-cut. The term branch-and-cut and the ideas encompassing it, are the direct result of this research effort. Now the two leading commercial codes for solving integer programming problems, OSL and CpleX both incorporate cutting plane ideas and use the term branch-and-cut in their marketing literature.",

Effects of Fuel Prices and Slot Controls on Air Transportation Performance at New York Airports,Karla Hoffman,"Industry strategists and government regulators have focused on addressing concerns over the performance of the air transportation system with respect to delays. Emphasis has been placed on managing the problems at New York slot controlled airports, since 12% of flight delays have been attributed to flights passing through New York. This paper examines the effect of increased fuel prices on the performance of the air transportation system. Analysis identified that the number of markets served and the flights operated have remained constant in the presence of increased operational costs (+ 59%). Revenue has increased 29% through changes in airfares and the use of smaller aircraft (down 3%), while keeping service to all markets. With aircraft size changes and scheduling adjustments, flight delays have been reduced by 14% in 2008.

An enhancement to the current cooperative decision making process for capacity allocation: Tradable permits,Karla Hoffman,"The current mechanism for allocating scarce runway or airspace capacity on the day of flight depends primarily on the user’s share of the flight plans filed. A carrier with many flight plans at a given airport is granted a larger share of available capacity than one with only a few flight plans. Such an allocation mechanism may be fair, in some sense, but it does not necessarily reflect the users’ willingness-to-pay for priority in times of demand-capacity imbalances. Some higher-valued users may be delayed or face potential cancellations when they would be willing to pay to avoid disruptions in their flight schedules while other airlines may be willing to forego their current priority for compensation. This paper discusses alternatives to the current cooperative decision-making mechanism used by air-traffic control to allocate air space and runway capacity. We recognize the desirable traits of the current system and consider how that system might be enhanced rather than replaced.One remedy to any economic inefficiency in the current system is to implement a market-based traffic flow management scheme. When we speak of “efficiencies”, we are specifically considering the economic meaning of the term, namely that the product (in this case, permission to takeoff) is provided to those that value it the most and are, therefore, likely to use them best. A wide variety of market-based concepts are conceivable. In this research, we evaluate a variety of alternative market-based mechanisms and chose three promising mechanisms to test via computer simulations. The simulations examined how each market-based alternative impacted system-wide delays, average …",Scholar articles An enhancement to the current cooperative decision making process for capacity allocation: Tradable permitsK HoffmanRelated articles All 4 versions ,"The current mechanism for allocating scarce runway or airspace capacity on the day of flight depends primarily on the user’s share of the flight plans filed.
