System and simulation modeling using SysML,"Edward Huang, Randeep Ramamurthy, Leon F McGinnis",2007/12/9,Conference 2007 Winter Simulation Conference,"Simulation languages and the GUIs supporting them may be excellent tools for creating simulation codes, but are not necessarily the best tools to use for creating descriptions of systems, i.e., for modeling. In 2006, OMG published the initial standard specification (OMG 2006) for SysML (Systems Modeling Language), an extension of UML (OMG 2007) designed specifically to support systems engineering. SysML shows great promise for creating object-oriented models of systems that incorporate not only software, but also people, material, and other physical resources, expressing both structure and behavior for such systems. In this paper, we explore the use of SysML both to model a system to be simulated and to support the automatic generation of simulation models.",170

Recent research in simulation optimization and explosive growth in computing power have made it feasible to use simulations to optimize the design and operations of systems directly. Concurrently, ubiquitous sensing, pervasive computing, and unprecedented systems interconnectivity have ushered in a new era of industrialization (the so-called Industrial 4.0/Industrial Internet). In this article, we argue that simulation optimization is a decision-making tool that can be applied to many scenarios to tremendous effect. By capitalizing on an unprecedented integration of sensing, computing, and control, simulation optimization provides the “smart brain” required to drastically improve the efficiency of industrial systems.

MO2TOS: Multi-Fidelity Optimization with Ordinal Transformation and Optimal Sampling,"Jie Xu, Si Zhang, Edward Huang, Chun-Hung Chen, Loo Hay Lee, Nurcin Celik",2016/6/20,Journal Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research,"Simulation optimization can be used to solve many complex optimization problems in automation applications such as job scheduling and inventory control. We propose a new framework to perform efficient simulation optimization when simulation models with different fidelity levels are available. The framework consists of two novel methodologies: ordinal transformation (OT) and optimal sampling (OS). The OT methodology uses the low-fidelity simulations to transform the original solution space into an ordinal space that encapsulates useful information from the low-fidelity model. The OS methodology efficiently uses high-fidelity simulations to sample the transformed space in search of the optimal solution. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate the promising performance of the multi-fidelity optimization with ordinal transformation and optimal sampling (MO2TOS) framework.",87
Optimal inventory control in a multi-period newsvendor problem with non-stationary demand,"Gitae Kim, Kan Wu, Edward Huang",2015/1/1,Journal Advanced Engineering Informatics,"The optimal control of inventory in supply chains plays a key role in the competiveness of a corporation. The inventory cost can account for half of company’s logistics cost. The classical inventory models, e.g., newsvendor and EOQ models, assume either a single or infinite planning periods. However, these models may not be applied to perishable products which usually have a certain shelf life. To optimize the total logistic cost for perishable products, this paper presents a multi-period newsvendor model, and the problem is formulated as a multi-stage stochastic programming model with integer recourse decisions. We extend the progressive hedging method to solve the model efficiently. A numerical example and its sensitivity analysis are demonstrated.",86
Strategic robust supply chain design based on the Pareto-optimal tradeoff between efficiency and risk,"Edward Huang, Marc Goetschalckx",2014/9/1,Journal European Journal of Operational Research,"The strategic design of a robust supply chain has to determine the configuration of the supply chain so that its performance remains of a consistently high quality for all possible future conditions. The current modeling techniques often only consider either the efficiency or the risk of the supply chain. Instead, we define the strategic robust supply chain design as the set of all Pareto-optimal configurations considering simultaneously the efficiency and the risk, where the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the efficiency. We model the problem as the Mean–Standard Deviation Robust Design Problem (MSD-RDP). Since the standard deviation has a square root expression, which makes standard maximization algorithms based on mixed-integer linear programming non-applicable, we show the equivalency to the Mean–Variance Robust Design Problem (MV-RDP).

Efficient multi-fidelity simulation optimization,"Jie Xu, Si Zhang, Edward Huang, Chun-Hung Chen, Loo Hay Lee, Nurcin Celik",2014/12/7,Book Proceedings of the 2014 winter simulation conference,"Simulation models of different fidelity levels are often available for a complex system. High-fidelity simulations are accurate but time-consuming. Therefore, they can only be applied to a small number of solutions. Low-fidelity simulations are faster and can evaluate a large number of solutions. But their results may contain significant bias and variability. We propose an Multi-fidelity Optimization with Ordinal Transformation and Optimal Sampling (MO2TOS) framework to exploit the benefits of high- and low-fidelity simulations to efficiently identify a (near) optimal solution. MO2TOS uses low-fidelity simulations for all solutions and then assigns a fixed budget of high-fidelity simulations to solutions based on low-fidelity simulation results.

Ontologies and simulation: a practical approach,"Leon McGinnis, Edward Huang, Ky Sang Kwon, Volkan Ustun",2011/8/1,Journal Journal of Simulation,"The challenges in cost-effectively deploying simulation technology are well known. Two major challenges are creating an appropriate conceptual model and translating that conceptual model correctly into a computational model. Ontologies have been widely discussed as one mechanism for capturing modelling knowledge in a reusable form, making it effectively available in the conceptual and computational modelling phases. In this paper, we show how ontologies can be effectively deployed in simulation using recent innovations from systems engineering and software engineering. We use OMG SysML™ to create an ontology implementation referred to as a domain-specific language, or DSL, for a class of simulation applications; the DSL is used to create a specific (conceptual) user model for a problem in the domain. We then use model transformation to automate the translation to a computational simulation …",42
Multi-fidelity model integration for engineering design,"Edward Huang, Jie Xu, Si Zhang, Chun-Hung Chen",2015/1/1,Journal Procedia Computer Science,"Systems engineers have long been using analytical and computational models to approximately predict the behaviors of systems and use these models to guide the design of engineered systems. However, until now, systems engineers are still forced to compromise on model fidelity, modeling accuracy, and the optimality of the selected design alternatives through the whole engineering design process. Although high-fidelity models can provide an accurate estimation, running these models is usually time-consuming. On the other hand, low-fidelity models are much faster, but their results may contain significant bias and variability. In this research, we propose a Multi-fidelity Optimization with Ordinal Transformation and Optimal Sampling (MO2TOS) framework to integrate both high- and low-fidelity model to efficiently identify a (near) optimal design.

Verifying SysML activity diagrams using formal transformation to Petri nets,"Edward Huang, Leon F McGinnis, Steven W Mitchell",2020/1,Journal Systems Engineering,"The development of contemporary systems is an extremely complex process. One approach to modeling system behavior uses activity diagrams from Unified Modeling Language (UML)/System Modeling Language (SysML), providing a standard object‐oriented graphical notation and enhancing reusability. However, UML/SysML activity diagrams do not directly support the kind of analysis needed to verify the system behavior, such as might be available with a Petri net (PN) model. We show that a behavior model represented by a set of fUML‐compliant modeling elements in UML/SysML activity diagrams can be transformed into an equivalent PN, so that the analysis capability of PN can be applied. We define a formal mathematical notation for a set of modeling elements in activity diagrams, show the mapping rules between PN and activity diagrams, and propose a formal transformation algorithm.

A multi-objective production planning problem with the consideration of time and cost in clinical trials,"Hui Zhao, Edward Huang, Runliang Dou, Kan Wu",2019/6/15,Journal Expert Systems with Applications,"Under increasingly challenging circumstances, pharmaceutical companies try to reduce the overproduction of clinical drugs, which is commonly seen in the pharmaceutical industry. When the overproduction is simply reduced without an efficient coordination of the inventories in the supply chain, the stock-outs at clinical sites and clinical trial delay can hardly be avoided. In this study, we propose a multi-objective model to optimize the production quantity, where the clinical trial duration and the total production and operational costs are minimized. The problem is formulated as a multi-stage stochastic programming model to capture the dynamic inventory allocation process in the supply chains. Since this problem's solving time and required memory can increase significantly with the increase of the stage and scenario numbers, the progressive hedging algorithm is applied as the solution approach in this paper.

Airport baggage handling system simulation modeling using SysML,"James T Lin, Ping-Hsi Shih, Edward Huang, Chun-Chih Chiu",2015/3/3,Conference 2015 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM),"In recent years, the number of passengers visiting the major international airport, Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TPE), has increased dramatically. The passenger traffic has gone beyond the capacity of the airport as it was constructed for. One important infrastructure in the airport is the baggage handling system which consists of a set of conveyors that transport checked baggage to the baggage unloading zones or the buffer zones. How to efficiently operate the baggage handling system is of critical importance. Simulation models are widely used to evaluate the system performances and to compare alternatives. However, modeling and analyzing the baggage handling system is not straightforward. However, the means of modeling and analyzing the baggage handling system is not in good form.

Trading off supply chain risk and efficiency through supply chain design,"Marc Goetschalckx, Edward Huang, Pratik Mital",2013/1/1,Journal Procedia computer science,"The configuration of complex systems to improve their efficiency (reward), risk, or a combination of both performance measures has long been a goal of systems engineering. This research focuses on designing supply chain systems where a large number of discrete configurations exist. The uncertainty of the future is modeled as a set of scenarios. The risk of the system is modeled as the standard deviation of the profits of the various scenarios, while the efficiency or reward of the system is computed as the expected value of the scenario profits. A configuration for which no other configuration exists that has both higher reward and lower risk is said to be Pareto-optimal. An optimizing algorithm that efficiently identifies all Pareto-optimal configurations of a supply chain is presented.

Improving analytic hierarchy process expert allocation using optimal computing budget allocation,"Edward Huang, Si Zhang, Loo Hay Lee, Ek Peng Chew, Chun-Hung Chen",2015/10/7,"Journal IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been widely applied to multicriteria decision making problems. The AHP aids decision makers to determine the priorities of multiple criteria, and make reasonable decisions. In the AHP, evaluating candidate alternatives requires multiple experts' evaluations to avoid personal subjectivity. Although having more experts can improve selection quality, inviting more experts also results in higher recruitment cost and longer evaluation time. In this paper, we introduce the idea of optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) and propose a method, named the AHP_OCBA method, to improve the efficiency of expert allocation. The proposed method optimizes the allocation of experts to maximize the probability of correctly selecting the best alternative in the AHP. This method also can minimize the required number of experts to meet the probability of correct selection. An illustrative …",20
Toward on-demand wafer fab simulation using formal structure & behavior models,"Edward Huang, Ky Sang Kwon, Leon McGinnis",2008/12/7,Conference 2008 Winter Simulation Conference,"Contemporary factories in capital intensive industries such as semiconductor manufacturing are very complex, with many sources of risk.

Application of multi-fidelity simulation modelling to integrated circuit packaging,"Liam Y Hsieh, Edward Huang, Chun-Hung Chen, Si Zhang, Kuo-Hao Chang",2016,Journal International Journal of Simulation and Process Modelling,"In semiconductor manufacturing, time-to-market is critical to maintain a competitive advantage through achieving customer satisfaction. Inefficient ways of utilising production resources will lead to a long cycle time. Therefore, machine allocation becomes an essential production decision in many practical manufacturing systems, especially for integrated circuit (IC) packaging. IC packaging is the process of encasing the finished die in a package in order to prevent corrosion and physical damage. Advanced IC packaging techniques add even more complexity into the production system, so reliable average cycle time of this complex system becomes difficult to obtain. We propose a new simulation optimisation framework with multi-fidelity models to study an IC packaging case of the machine allocation problem to pursue a minimum average cycle time.

Job dispatch control for production lines with overlapped time window constraints,"Mengchang Wang, Sandeep Srivathsan, Edward Huang, Kan Wu",2018/4/16,Journal IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing,"Semiconductor manufacturing processes often come with stringent requirements for product quality. In order to satisfy these requirements, time window constraints have been imposed. Typically, violation of the time windows can result in a lot being either reworked or scrapped. The presence of overlapped time window constraints renders the control of production lines very challenging as it involves managing the production process of many lots across multiple workstations. We study the performance of a production line with deterministic service times and predetermined, overlapped time windows. We solve the P|rj|Cmax problem to estimate the queue time at each workstation, and develop an algorithm to decide whether a new lot can be released for processing at its first workstation so as to meet all time window constraints.",12
Do Public Subsidies Sell Green Cars?

Discrete event system modeling using SysML and model transformation,Chien-Chung Huang,2011/8/29,Institution Georgia Institute of Technology,"The objective of this dissertation is to introduce a unified framework for modeling and simulating discrete event logistics systems (DELS) by using a formal language, the System Modeling Language (SysML), for conceptual modeling and a corresponding methodology for translating the conceptual model into a simulation model. There are three parts in this research: plant modeling, control modeling, and simulation generation. Part 1:Plant Modeling of Discrete Event Logistics Systems. Contemporary DELS are complex and challenging to design. One challenge is to describe the system in a formal language. We propose a unified framework for modeling DELS using SysML. A SysML subset for plant modeling is identified in this research. We show that any system can be described by using the proposed subset if the system can be modeled using finite state machines or finite state automata. Furthermore, the system modeled by the proposed subset can avoid the state explosion problem, i.e., the number of the system states grows exponentially when the number of the components increases. We also compare this approach to other existing modeling languages. Part 2:Control Modeling of Discrete Event Logistics Systems. The development of contemporary manufacturing control systems is an extremely complex process.

The federal Highway Trust Fund, after being financially independent for more than fifty years, now relies on transfers from the General Fund to stay solvent. As new vehicles become more fuel-efficient, and the costs to build and maintain transportation systems increase, this funding gap will only widen.",6
Taxing for Takeoff: Estimating Airport Tax Incidence through Natural Experiments,"Edward Huang, Adib Kanafani",2010,Journal Available at SSRN 1591312,"We view the different start dates of US airport taxes as replicated natural experiments. In each, a portion of plane tickets are subject to a new tax of $3. We show that airlines, in response, raise nonstop fares by $6.5 and overshift the tax onto their nonstop passengers; however, they keep connecting fares little changed and appear burdened by the tax. The results suggest that airport taxes and other similar taxes encourage airlines to provide more nonstop services, and we argue that these taxes can be redesigned to promote both efficiency and equity.",6
Clinical trial supply chain design based on the Pareto-optimal trade-off between time and cost,"Hui Zhao, Kan Wu, Edward Huang",2018/6/3,Journal IISE Transactions,"Long duration and high cost are two key characteristics of clinical trials. Since the clinical trial duration is part of the limited patent life and determines the time to market, its reduction is of critical importance. Although the duration can be reduced through increasing the number of clinical sites in the supply chain, the total enrollment and operational costs are also increased. Hence, Pareto-optimal supply chain configurations are used to improve clinical trial efficiency. In this study, we propose a multi-objective clinical site selection model that considers the trade-off between time and cost of clinical trials. An efficiency curve representing the Pareto-optimal trade-off is provided for decision makers to design the supply chain. To identify all Pareto-optimal supply chain configurations efficiently, we develop an algorithm based on proposed propositions. The optimality cuts are derived to improve the solving efficiency of this …",4
A study on the optimal inventory allocation for clinical trial supply chains,"Meimei Zheng, Ningxin Du, Hui Zhao, Edward Huang, Kan Wu",2021/10/1,Journal Applied Mathematical Modelling,"With increasing competition in the pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical companies pay more attention to improving the efficiency of clinical trial supply chains to reduce the drug supplying cost, which takes up a considerable part of the total research and development expense. To improve the efficiency of clinical trial supply chains, this study investigates the inventory levels of clinical drugs in each period at a distribution center and clinics considering the reverse replenishment, transshipment, and generalized stockout cost. The inventory allocation problem in clinical trial supply chains is formulated as a rolling horizon-based two-stage stochastic mixed-integer model where the minimal operational cost constitutes the underage cost at the production planning level of clinical trial supply chains. An algorithm extending Benders decomposition is proposed as the solution approach. We also derive several structural …",3
Job scheduling at cascading machines,"Edward Huang, Kan Wu",2017/5/16,Journal IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,"We consider the serial batching scheduling problem in which a group of machines can process multiple jobs continuously to reduce the processing times of the second and subsequent jobs. The maximum batch size is finite. Since all jobs in the same batch are loaded and unloaded simultaneously, a completed job has to wait for the others. We examine how to schedule all jobs to minimize the total completion time. If the batch size is only one, i.e., a single job per batch, the total processing time will be longer, since no reduction in processing time is possible. As a consequence, the total completion time will also be longer. On the other hand, if the batch size is large, the total completion time can be large. Each job has to wait until all jobs in the same batch are completed. We identify several optimality properties of the optimal batching sequence. These properties are used to develop a dynamic programming algorithm …",3
Improving ordinal transformation through optimal combination of multi-model predictions,"Si Zhang, Jie Xu, Edward Huang, Chun-Hung Chen, Siyang Gao",2016/3/14,Conference 2016 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT),"Optimization of large-scale complex systems often involves high-fidelity computational simulation models that are very time-consuming. As a result, the number of objective function evaluations is often very limited and presents a major hurdle for optimization. Previous works on a new framework known as ordinal transformation (OT) provides a method that makes use of a low-fidelity approximate model to speed up optimization. The effectiveness of OT depends crucially on the accuracy of the predictions by the approximate model. In this paper, we study how to improve the quality of the predictions when there are two or more low-fidelity models. We set up an optimization formulation that allows us to identify the optimal linear combination of multiple low-fidelity model outputs to improve the quality of the prediction.

Robust Material Handling System Design Based on The Risk Versus Cost Tradeoff,"Marc Goetschalckx, Edward Huang, Pratik Mital",2012,"Description The design and planning of major material handling systems belongs to the class of systems design problems under uncertainty. The overall structure of the system is decided during the current design stage, while the values of the future conditions and the future planning decisions are not known with certainty. Typically the future uncertainty is modeled through a number of scenarios and each scenario has an individual timediscounted total system cost. The overall performance of the material handling system is characterized by the distribution of these scenario costs. The central tendency of the cost distribution is almost always computed as the expected value of the distribution. Several alternatives can be used for the dispersion of the distribution such as the standard deviation and variance. In this study the standard deviation of the cost distribution is used as the measure of the risk of the system. The goal is to identify all configurations of the material handling system that are Pareto optimal with respect to the trade off between the expected value and the standard deviation of the costs; such Pareto-optimal configurations are also called efficient. The final selection of the material handling system for implementation can then be made based on the Pareto graph and other considerations such as the risk preferences of the system owner.","The design and planning of major material handling systems belongs to the class of systems design problems under uncertainty.

Job scheduling of diffusion furnaces in semiconductor fabrication facilities,"Kan Wu, Edward Huang, Mengchang Wang, Meimei Zheng",2022/8/16,Journal European Journal of Operational Research,"Furnaces are commonly seen in the front-end to the middle portion of the semiconductor process flow and their scheduling plays a key role in semiconductor manufacturing.

An optimization approach for team coordination through information sharing,"Yijie Peng, Edward Huang, Jie Xu, Chun-Hung Chen",2017/8/20,Conference 2017 13th IEEE Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE),"Team coordination and information sharing are important in concurrent engineering (CE), where multiple design teams execute their tasks simultaneously and then share information to update their designs, e.g., through integrated tests. The process then iterates until the global design objective is optimized. When properly controlled and executed, CE can be an effective method to speed up the design process for complex and large-scale projects thanks to its parallel nature. Recently, a coordinate optimization framework is proposed in [1] to model and control the information sharing in CE. It can be shown that under a convexity assumption, CE converges to a globally optimal design. In this paper, we study how the coordinate optimization framework can be applied to CE in a general environment where the objective function is non-convex.

Combating sex trafficking: The role of the hotel—moral and Ethical Questions,"Chu-Chuan Jeng, Edward Huang, Sarah Meo, Louise Shelley",2022/2/2,Journal Religions,"Legitimate companies are key facilitators of human trafficking. These corporate facilitators include not only websites providing advertisements for commercial sex services but also hotels and motels. Analysis of all active federal criminal sex trafficking cases in 2018 and 2019 reveals that in approximately 80% of these cases, victims were exploited at either hotels or motels. This paper studies the prevalence of the hospitality industry in the crime of sex trafficking and the failure of this industry to address this problem until recent civil suits were filed by victims against individual hotels and chains. Drawing on the civil cases filed in federal courts by victims of human trafficking between 2015 and 2021 along the East Coast of the United States, this paper assesses the characteristics of these hotels and the conditions in the hotels that facilitated sex trafficking. The paper then explores the moral and ethical problems posed by the facilitating role of hotel owners/operators in sex trafficking either through collusion or failure to act on and/or report evidence of individual abuse.

A Domain Engineering Framework Based on Probabilistic Ontologies for Automated Selection of Features to Reuse,"Shou Matsumoto, James D Lee, Muhammad Imran, Edward Huang, Kathryn B Laskey, Paulo CG Costa",2019,Conference Systems Engineering in Context: Proceedings of the 16th Annual Conference on Systems Engineering Research,"As the complexity demanded for new systems increases, techniques for reusing existing systems or artifacts become a key factor for achieving both productivity and quality. In such context, domain engineering (aka software product line engineering) is a discipline which focuses on reusing domain knowledge in order to quickly produce a family of systems, especially software-intensive systems. The nature of domain engineering involves developing conceptual models to capture vocabulary and meta-information about some particular domain and to define common and varying characteristics—or features—among systems. Since ontologies are, by definition, formal specifications of knowledge about some domain, they are a natural candidate for representing conceptual models in domain engineering.

A Game‐Theoretical Framework for Coordination in Requirement‐Based Engineering Design,"Soodabeh Yazdani, Edward Huang",2018/7,Journal INCOSE International Symposium,"Requirement‐based engineering design is a common practice that provides a definition of what is the desirable design solution. However, requirements define what constitutes the acceptable design from what is not, and provide a little guidance on the best design solution. Requirement‐based engineering with team coordination, on the other hand, allows design teams to exchange resources to best manage their resources. This may lead to the better design outcome. This paper investigates the benefits of coordination in requirement‐based engineering design. We apply game theory to formulate mathematical models of design problem with and without team coordination and demonstrate the mathematical framework on an illustrative example.

a Framework for the Robust Design of Unit Load Storage Systems,"Marc Goetschalckx, Edward Huang, Pratik Mital",2014,Description The unit load storage assignment problem determines the assignment of a set of unit loads with known arrival and departure times to a set of unit storage locations in a warehouse. The material handling device (s) can carry at most one unit load at the time. In this research it is assumed that each of the storage locations can be accessed directly without load relocations or rearrangements and that the travel times between the storage locations and from and to the warehousing docks can be computed in advance. The objective is to minimize the total travel time of the material handling device for performing a number of storage and retrieval operations. This type of storage system is in widespread use and implemented in both mechanized and automated systems. It is by far one of the most common storage system architectures for unit loads. The formulation of this problem belongs to the class of Assignment Problems (AP) but finding the optimal solution for the most general variant is provably hard for large problem instances. A classification of the different variants of the APs for unit loads will be presented. The size of the instance problem is proportional to the product of the number of loads and the number of locations and the number of periods in the planning horizon and is typically very large for real world problem instances.

Simulating Counterfeit Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Supply Chains During Covid-19,"Layla Hashemi, Chu Chuan Jeng, Ahna Mohiuddin, Edward Huang, Louise Shelley",2022/12/11,Conference 2022 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC),"Increased demand for medical supplies, and specifically respirators and face masks, during the Covid-19 pandemic along with the inability of legitimate suppliers to meet these needs created a window of opportunity for counterfeiters to capitalize on the supply chain disruptions caused by a global health crisis. Both legitimate and illicit businesses began shifting their scope from sectors such as textiles to producing and distributing personal protective equipment (PPE), many of which were counterfeit or unauthentic products and thus unable to properly protect users. To study cost-effective disruption strategies, this study proposes a simulation-optimization framework. The framework is used to model counterfeiters' behavior and analyze the effectiveness of different disruption strategies for counterfeit PPE supply chains during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
Counterfeit PPE: Substandard respirators and their entry into supply chains in major cities,"Layla Hashemi, Edward Huang, Louise Shelley",2022/9/30,Journal Urban Crime. An international Journal,"Over 58 million counterfeit respirators of substandard quality unable to protect individuals from infection have been seized globally since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. These seizures have primarily occurred in urban warehouses and ports around the world according to analysis of public and corporate data shared with the authors. The presence of tens of millions of respirators in storage facilities prior to distribution demonstrates that urban areas are key elements of illicit supply chains. Data suggests that the concept of urban insecurity needs to be reconsidered in light of illicit supply chains for counterfeit respirators and their role in facilitating disease transmission in urban areas. The analysis presented in this article suggests that threats to human life should not be confined narrowly to violent acts or the consumption of drugs. Human life can also be threatened through the massive distribution of counterfeit N95 masks during a pandemic, a problem that has become more acute with more contagious mutations of COVID-19.",

Robust Sampling Budget Allocation Under Deep Uncertainty,"Michael Perry, Jie Xu, Edward Huang, Chun-Hung Chen",2022/1/28,"Journal IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","A novel methodology is introduced for optimally allocating a sampling budget. Sampling budget allocation problems arise frequently in various settings. For example, in the design of complex engineering systems, given both the complexity of these systems and the imperfect information on new technologies, designers often face deep uncertainty as to system performance. Consequently, designers need to sample multiple alternative designs under a limited budget. This article proposes a minimax regret approach to allocate the sampling budget in the presence of deep uncertainty pertaining to system performance. The objective is to maximize the probability of selecting the design with the minimum–maximum regret under a limited sampling budget and imperfect information. To effectively solve the minimax regret problem, an approximation methodology that provides good solutions with quantifiable uncertainty is …",

Production TTR modeling and dynamic buckling analysis,"Hugh Liu, John Wei, Edward Huang",2013,Journal 收藏,"In a typical tension leg platform (TLP) design, the top tension factor (TTF), measuring the top tension of a top tensioned riser (TTR) relative to its submerged weight in water, is one of the most important design parameters that has to be specified properly. While a very small TTF may lead to excessive vortex induced vibration (VIV), clashing issues and possible compression close to seafloor, an unnecessarily high TTF may translate into excessive riser cost and vessel payload, and even has impacts on the TLP sizing and design in general. In the process of a production TTR design, it is found that its outer casing can be subjected to compression in a worst-case scenario with some extreme metocean and hardware conditions. The present paper shows how finite element analysis (FEA) models using beam elements and two different software packages (Flexcom and ABAQUS) are constructed to simulate the TTR properly, and especially the pipe-in-pipe effects. An ABAQUS model with hybrid elements (beam elements globally+ shell elements locally) can be used to investigate how the outer casing behaves under compression. It is shown for the specified TTR design, even with its outer casing being under some local compression in the worst-case scenario, dynamic buckling would not occur; therefore the TTR design is adequate.",

Departments of Radiation/Medical/Surgical Oncology and Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. Purpose: In view of the reluctance to accept surveillance as an alternative to adjuvant radiation therapy in clinical stage I seminoma (due to concerns regarding increased resource utilisation and the potential for late relapse), we analyzed our experience with the two approaches in terms of long term outcome and cost. Materials and Methods: Between January 1981 and December 1994, 470 patients with stage I testicular seminoma were treated at our institution. Of these, 245 patients received post-operative RT (25 Gy …",
Marc Goetschalckx Georgia Institute of Technology Pratik Mital Georgia Institute of Technology,Edward Huang,The unit load storage assignment problem determines the assignment of a set of unit loads with known arrival and departure times to a set of unit storage locations in a warehouse. The material handling device (s) can carry at most one unit load at the time. In this research it is assumed that each of the storage locations can be accessed directly without load relocations or rearrangements and that the travel times between the storage locations and from and to the warehousing docks can be computed in advance. The objective is to minimize the total travel time of the material handling device for performing a number of storage and retrieval operations. This type of storage system is in widespread use and implemented in both mechanized and automated systems. It is by far one of the most common storage system architectures for unit loads. The formulation of this problem belongs to the class of Assignment Problems (AP) but finding the optimal solution for the most general variant is provably hard for large problem instances. A classification of the different variants of the APs for unit loads will be presented. The size of the instance problem is proportional to the product of the number of loads and the number of locations and the number of periods in the planning horizon and is typically very large for real world problem instances. Efficient solutions algorithms only exist for product-based,Scholar articles Marc Goetschalckx Georgia Institute of Technology Pratik Mital Georgia Institute of TechnologyE HuangRelated articles ,The unit load storage assignment problem determines the assignment of a set of unit loads with known arrival and departure times to a set of unit storage locations in a warehouse.
