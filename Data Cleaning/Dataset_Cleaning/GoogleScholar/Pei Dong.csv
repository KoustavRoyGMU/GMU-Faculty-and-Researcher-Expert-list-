Template-free solvothermal preparation of ternary FeNi₂S₄ hollow balloons as RuO₂-like efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction with superior stability,"He Wang, Jianhua Tang, Yinle Li, Hang Chu, Yuancai Ge, Robert Baines, Pei Dong, Pulickel M Ajayan, Jianfeng Shen, Mingxin Ye",2018,"Description Ternary transition metal sulfide hollow structures are promising materials for energy storage and conversion applications. However, their synthetic methods are rather complicated and time-consuming. In this work, for the first time, with FeNi₂S₄ hollow balloons (FNSH) as the quintessential example, a template-free solvothermal method has been developed to synthesize ternary transition metal sulfide hollow balloons. The corresponding formation mechanism is deeply investigated, and the main factors affecting the formation of the hollow balloons are confirmed to be reaction time and temperature. FNSH/graphene aerogel (FNSH/GA) is further fabricated, which has been proven to be a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The FNSH/GA exhibits excellent performance for the OER with a small overpotential of 273 mV at 10 mA cm⁻² in 1.0 M KOH, which is even superior to the typical RuO₂ catalyst. Furthermore, the FNSH/GA maintains the excellent performance for the OER even after a 10 h chronoamperometric test. Moreover, the synthetic method is universal and can be widely extended to other ternary transition metal sulfide hollow balloons.","Ternary transition metal sulfide hollow structures are promising materials for energy storage and conversion applications.

These materials are attracting considerable interest in polymer science research. Polymer layered silicate nanocomposites are an important class of hybrid, organic/inorganic materials with substantially improved mechanical, thermal, and thermomechanical properties in comparison to pristine polymers. In addition, they also show superior ultraviolet (UV) as well as chemical resistance and are widely being investigated for improving gas barrier and flame retardant properties. Hectorite and montmorillonite are among the most commonly used smectite-type layered silicates for the preparation of polymer–clay nanocomposites.
