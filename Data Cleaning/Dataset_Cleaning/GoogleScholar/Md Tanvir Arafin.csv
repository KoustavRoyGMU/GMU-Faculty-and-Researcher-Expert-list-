Voltage over-scaling-based lightweight authentication for IoT security,"Jiliang Zhang, Chaoqun Shen, Haihan Su, Md Tanvir Arafin, Gang Qu",2021/1/6,Journal IEEE Transactions on Computers,"It is a challenging task to deploy lightweight security protocols in resource-constrained IoT applications. A hardware-oriented lightweight authentication protocol based on device signature generated during voltage over-scaling (VOS) was recently proposed to address this issue. VOS-based authentication employs the computation unit such as adders to generate the process variation dependent error, which is combined with secret keys to create a two-factor authentication protocol. In this article, machine learning (ML)-based modeling attacks to break such authentication is presented. We also propose a challenge self-obfuscation structure (CSoS) which employs previous challenges combined with keys or random numbers to obfuscate the current challenge for the VOS-based authentication to resist ML attacks. Experimental results show that ANN, RNN, and CMA-ES can clone the challenge-response behavior of …",60

We address this challenge by proposing a hardware-oriented lightweight authentication protocol based on device signature generated during voltage over-scaling (VOS).

This error can be methodically profiled to extract information about the underlying process variation in the computation unit. We then combine this error profile with security key based authentication schemes to create a two-factor authentication mechanism. To understand the effectiveness of this protocol, we perform detailed security analysis under various attack scenarios.
