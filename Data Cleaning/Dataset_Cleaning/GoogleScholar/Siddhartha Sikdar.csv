Myofascial trigger points then and now: a historical and scientific perspective,"Jay P Shah, Nikki Thaker, Juliana Heimur, Jacqueline V Aredo, Siddhartha Sikdar, Lynn Gerber",2015/7/1,Source PM&R,"The intent of this article is to discuss the evolving role of the myofascial trigger point (MTrP) in myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) from both a historical and scientific perspective. MTrPs are hard, discrete, palpable nodules in a taut band of skeletal muscle that may be spontaneously painful (i.e., active) or painful only on compression (i.e., latent). MPS is a term used to describe a pain condition that can be acute or, more commonly, chronic and involves the muscle and its surrounding connective tissue (e.g. fascia). According to Travell and Simons, MTrPs are central to the syndrome—but are they necessary? Although the clinical study of muscle pain and MTrPs has proliferated over the past two centuries, the scientific literature often seems disjointed and confusing. Unfortunately, much of the terminology, theories, concepts, and diagnostic criteria are inconsistent, incomplete, or controversial. To address these …",424
Fully dense UNet for 2-D sparse photoacoustic tomography artifact removal,"Steven Guan, Amir A Khan, Siddhartha Sikdar, Parag V Chitnis",2019/4/23,Journal IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Photoacoustic imaging is an emerging imaging modality that is based upon the photoacoustic effect. In photoacoustic tomography (PAT), the induced acoustic pressure waves are measured by an array of detectors and used to reconstruct an image of the initial pressure distribution. A common challenge faced in PAT is that the measured acoustic waves can only be sparsely sampled. Reconstructing sparsely sampled data using standard methods results in severe artifacts that obscure information within the image. We propose a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture termed fully dense UNet (FD-UNet) for removing artifacts from two-dimensional PAT images reconstructed from sparse data and compare the proposed CNN with the standard UNet in terms of reconstructed image quality.",273

This assessment is derived from Doppler velocity changes induced by the narrowing lumen of the artery. New research into the mechanisms for plaque rupture and atheroembolic stroke indicates that the degree of narrowing is an imperfect predictor of stroke risk, and that other factors, such as plaque composition and remodeling and biomechanical forces acting on the plaque, can play a role. New advances in ultrasound imaging technology have made it possible to investigate these measures of plaque vulnerability to identify pre-embolic unstable carotid plaques. Efforts have been made to quantify the morphologic appearance of the plaque in B-mode images and to correlate them with histology.

Spring-loaded inverted pendulum goes through two contraction-extension cycles during the single-support phase of walking,"Gabriel Antoniak, Tirthabir Biswas, Nelson Cortes, Siddhartha Sikdar, Chanwoo Chun, Vikas Bhandawat",2019/6/15,Journal Biology open,"Despite the overall complexity of legged locomotion, the motion of the center of mass (COM) itself is relatively simple, and can be qualitatively described by simple mechanical models.

However, SLIP has many limitations and is unlikely to serve as a quantitative model. As a first step to obtaining a quantitative model for walking, we explored the ability of SLIP to model the single-support phase of walking, and found that SLIP has two limitations. First, it predicts larger horizontal ground reaction forces (GRFs) than empirically observed. A new model – angular and radial spring-loaded inverted pendulum (ARSLIP) – can overcome this deficit.

Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is associated with cerebral hypoperfusion,"Amir A Khan, Jigar Patel, Sarasijhaa Desikan, Matthew Chrencik, Janice Martinez-Delcid, Brian Caraballo, John Yokemick, Vicki L Gray, John D Sorkin, Juan Cebral, Siddhartha Sikdar, Brajesh K Lal",2021/5/1,Journal Journal of vascular surgery,"We have shown that almost 50% of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) will demonstrate cognitive impairment. Recent evidence has suggested that cerebral hypoperfusion is an important cause of cognitive impairment. Carotid stenosis can restrict blood flow to the brain, with consequent cerebral hypoperfusion. In contrast, cross-hemispheric collateral compensation through the Circle of Willis, and cerebrovascular vasodilation can also mitigate the effects of flow restriction. It is, therefore, critical to develop a clinically relevant measure of net brain perfusion in patients with ACS that could help in risk stratification and in determining the appropriate treatment. To determine whether ACS results in cerebral hypoperfusion, we developed a novel approach to quantify interhemispheric cerebral perfusion differences, measured as the time to peak (TTP) and mean transit time (MTT) delays using …",14
Noninvasive characterization of carotid plaque strain,"Amir A Khan, Siddhartha Sikdar, Thomas Hatsukami, Juan Cebral, Michael Jones, John Huston, George Howard, Brajesh K Lal",2017/6/1,Journal Journal of vascular surgery,Current risk stratification of internal carotid artery plaques based on diameter-reducing percentage stenosis may be unreliable because ischemic stroke results from plaque disruption with atheroembolization. Biomechanical forces acting on the plaque may render it vulnerable to rupture. The feasibility of ultrasound-based quantification of plaque displacement and strain induced by hemodynamic forces and their relationship to high-risk plaques have not been determined. We studied the feasibility and reliability of carotid plaque strain measurement from clinical B-mode ultrasound images and the relationship of strain to high-risk plaque morphology.,13
A novel application of musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging,"Avinash Eranki, Nelson Cortes, Zrinka Gregurić Ferenček, Siddhartha Sikdar",2013/9/17,Journal JoVE (Journal of Visualized Experiments),"Ultrasound is an attractive modality for imaging muscle and tendon  motion during dynamic tasks and can provide a complementary methodological  approach for biomechanical studies in a clinical or laboratory setting.

Approximately 30% of ischemic strokes are due to plaque rupture in the carotid arteries. The most popular diagnostic method uses Doppler ultrasound to find the percent stenosis. However, other factors, such as the hemodynamics around the plaque may play a larger role in identifying the risk of plaque rupture. It has been shown previously in simulations that non-collateral flow in the circle of Willis (COW) could cause an increase of the intraluminal velocity around carotid plaque. This added strain may increase the vulnerability of the plaque to rupture.

Adaptive clutter rejection for 3D color Doppler imaging: preliminary clinical study,"Yang Mo Yoo, Siddhartha Sikdar, Kerem Karadayi, Orpheus Kolokythas, Yongmin Kim",2008/8/1,Journal Ultrasound in medicine & biology,"In three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound color Doppler imaging (CDI), effective rejection of flash artifacts caused by tissue motion (clutter) is important for improving sensitivity in visualizing blood flow in vessels. Since clutter characteristics can vary significantly during volume acquisition, a clutter rejection technique that can adapt to the underlying clutter conditions is desirable for 3D CDI. We have previously developed an adaptive clutter rejection (ACR) method, in which an optimum filter is dynamically selected from a set of predesigned clutter filters based on the measured clutter characteristics. In this article, we evaluated the ACR method with 3D in vivo data acquired from 37 kidney transplant patients clinically indicated for a duplex ultrasound examination.

Critical signals were situations in which the simulated aircraft were on a potential collision course. Findings show that overall signal detection and CBFV both declined over time. While performance was more stable over time in the KR condition, performance declined in the no-KR condition. In addition, the initial level and temporal decline in CBFV were both greater for the KR condition than the no-KR condition.

Sonomyography, or ultrasound-based sensing of muscle deformation, avoids some of the problems of electromyography and enables classification of multiple motion patterns in individuals with upper limb loss. Because sonomyography has been previously studied only in individuals with transradial limb loss, the purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of an individual with transhumeral limb loss using this modality for motion classification. A secondary aim was to compare motion classification performance between electromyography and sonomyography. A single individual with transhumeral limb loss created two datasets containing 11 motions each (individual flexion of each finger, thumb abduction, power grasp, key grasp, tripod, point, pinch, wrist pronation). Electromyography or sonomyography signals associated with every motion were acquired and cross-validation accuracy was computed for each dataset. While all motions were usually predicted successfully with both electromyography and sonomyography, the cross-validation accuracies were typically higher for sonomyography. Although this was an exploratory study, the results suggest that controlling an upper limb prosthesis using sonomyography may be feasible for individuals with transhumeral limb loss.",3

In order to effectively allocate resources and identify policy solutions to reduce the number of overdoses, it is important to understand the geographical differences in opioid overdose rates and their causes. In this study, we utilized data on emergency department opioid overdose (EDOOD) visits to explore the county-level spatio-temporal distribution of opioid overdose rates within the state of Virginia and their association with aggregate socio-ecological factors. The analyses were performed using a combination of techniques including Moran’s I and multilevel modeling. Using data from 2016–2021, we found that Virginia counties had notable differences in their EDOOD visit rates with significant neighborhood-level associations: many counties in the southwestern region were consistently identified as the hotspots (areas with a higher concentration of EDOOD visits) whereas many counties in the northern region were consistently identified as the coldspots (areas with a lower concentration of EDOOD visits). In most Virginia counties, EDOOD visit rates declined from 2017 to 2018. In more recent years (since 2019), the visit rates showed an increasing trend. The multilevel modeling revealed that the change in clinical care factors (i.e., access to care and quality of care) and socio-economic factors (i.e., levels of education, employment, income, family and social support, and community safety) were significantly associated with the change in the EDOOD visit rates.

Spring-loaded inverted pendulum goes through two contraction-extension cycles during the single stance phase of walking,"Gabriel Antoniak, Tirthabir Biswas, Nelson Cortes, Siddhartha Sikdar, Chanwoo Chun, Vikas Bhandawat",2019/1/2,Journal bioRxiv,"Despite the overall complexity of legged locomotion, the motion of the center of mass (COM) itself is relatively simple, and can be qualitatively described by simple mechanical models. The spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) is one such model, and describes both the COM motion and the ground reaction forces (GRFs) during running. Similarly, walking can be modeled by two SLIP-like legs (double SLIP or DSLIP). However, DSLIP has many limitations and is unlikely to serve as a quantitative model for walking. As a first step to obtaining a quantitative model for walking, we explored the ability of SLIP to model the single stance phase of walking across the entire range of walking speeds. We show that SLIP can be employed to quantitatively model the single stance phase except for two exceptions: first, it predicts larger horizontal GRFs than empirically observed. A new model - angular and radial spring-loaded inverted pendulum (ARSLIP) can overcome this deficit. Second, even the single stance phase has active elements, and therefore a quantitative model of locomotion would require active elements. Surprisingly, the leg spring undergoes a contraction-extension-contraction-extension (CECE) during walking; this cycling is partly responsible for the M-shaped GRFs produced during walking. The CECE cycle also lengthens the stance duration allowing the COM to travel passively for a longer time, and decreases the velocity redirection between the beginning and end of a step. A combination of ARSLIP along with active mechanisms during transition from one step to the next is necessary to describe walking.",1

In particular, we introduce a framework that uses a combination of univariate and multivariate frequency tables from a given target geographical location in combination with frequency tables from other auxiliary locations to generate synthetic microdata for individuals in the target location. Our method combines the estimation of a dependency graph and conditional probabilities from the target location with the use of a Gaussian copula to leverage the available information from the auxiliary locations. We perform extensive testing on two real-world datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior approaches in preserving the overall dependency structure of the data while also satisfying the constraints defined on the different variables.",
SonoMyoNet: A Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting Isometric Force From Highly Sparse Ultrasound Images,"Anne Tryphosa Kamatham, Meena Alzamani, Allison Dockum, Siddhartha Sikdar, Biswarup Mukherjee",2022/6/12,Journal bioRxiv,"Ultrasound imaging or sonomyography has been found to be a robust modality for sensing muscle activity due to its ability to directly image deep-seated muscles while providing superior spatiotemporal specificity compared to surface electromyography-based techniques. Quantifying the morphological changes during muscle activity involves computationally expensive approaches to track muscle anatomical structures or extracting features from B-mode images and A-mode signals. In this paper an offline regression convolutional neural network (CNN) called SonoMyoNet for estimating continuous isometric force from sparse ultrasound scanlines has been presented. SonoMyoNet learns features from a few equispaced scanlines selected from B-mode images and utilizes the learned features to accurately estimate continuous isometric force. The performance of SonoMyoNet was evaluated by varying the number of scanlines to simulate the placement of multiple single element ultrasound transducers in a wearable system. Results showed that SonoMyoNet could accurately predict isometric force with just four scanlines and is immune to speckle noise and shifts in the scanline location. Thus, the proposed network reduces the computational load involved in feature tracking algorithms and estimates muscle force from global features of sparse ultrasound images.",

SMG overcomes several limitations inherent to EMG such as poor signal to noise ratio, muscle crosstalk, and limited spatiotemporal resolution. These shortcomings of EMG limit their utility and ability to provide dexterous control of modern multiarticulated biomechatronic devices such as prosthetic arms, and exoskeletons. Sonomyography is sensitive to detect muscle activity from deep seated muscles in real-time, enabling robust and intuitive modality for human machine interfacing.

Towards real-time muscle fatigue and recovery markers using a wearable continuous wave Doppler ultrasound system,"Joseph Majdi, Parag V Chitnis, Siddhartha Sikdar",2020/10,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is commonly used in physical rehabilitation, bypassing the central nervous system to activate motor neurons directly. However, the unnatural muscle recruitment pattern induced by FES causes rapid muscle fatigue, greatly reducing the muscle's ability to generate force. Currently there exists no reliable, real time indicator for FES-induced muscle fatigue. We believe that signs of muscle fatigue can be inferred from medical ultrasound. Previously we investigated tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) to study muscle physiology associated with muscle potentiation and fatigue. Here, we expand on that research using continuous wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound to create a wearable, low power muscle fatigue monitor.

Cerebral perfusion deficit could be an important contributor to cognitive impairment. The relationship between carotid stenosis and cerebral perfusion deficit is not established. If established, this could lead to a more informed selection of ACS patients likely to benefit from carotid revascularization. Perfusion-weighted MR imaging (PWI) is a clinically viable non-invasive technique to quantify cerebral perfusion. However, its impact is limited due to lack of efficient clinical tools to analyze PWI data in different brain regions for characterizing interhemispheric perfusion asymmetry. Development of automated approaches to characterize clinically relevant perfusion deficits is therefore required.

It is A Multi-stage, Multi-resolution, and Multi-volumes-of-interest Volume Registration Method. A single region registration is optimized first for a close initial alignment to avoid convergence to a locally optimal solution. Multiple sub-volumes of interest can then be selected as target alignment regions to achieve confident consistency across the volume. Finally, a multi-resolution rigid registration is performed on these sub-volumes associated with different weights in the cost function. We applied the method on 3D endovaginal ultrasound image data acquired from patients during biopsy procedure of the pelvic floor muscle. Systematic assessment of our proposed method through cross validation demonstrated its accuracy and robustness. The algorithm can also be applied on medical imaging data of other modalities for which the traditional rigid registration methods would fail.",

Measuring tendon velocities using vector tissue Doppler imaging.,"Avinash Eranki, Siddhartha Sikdar, Christopher Stanley, Laura Prosser, Lindsey Bellini, Daniel Bland, Katharine Alter, Diane Damiano",2010/10,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,We have developed a vector tissue Doppler imaging (vTDI) method to quantify the magnitude and direction of tissue motion. The goal of this study was to quantify the repeatability of vTDI in measuring the contraction velocity of the tibialis anterior (TA) tendon in patients with cerebral palsy and foot drop (impaired dorsiflexion). vTDI was implemented on Ultrasonix Sonix Touch ultrasound system with a 5–14‐MHz linear array transducer. The array was electronically split into two transmit and two receive apertures to estimate velocity vectors. Transmit and receive beams were steered by ±15 deg. We conducted 42 trials on 7 subjects. Our preliminary results show that TA tendon velocities measured using vTDI have a strong linear correlation with the joint angular velocity estimated using a conventional 3‐D motion capture system. We observed a peak velocity of 5.20±1.58 cm/s during dorsiflexion and 8.45±2.06 cm/s …,

Ultrasonic Doppler Vibrometry: Novel Method for Detection of Left Ventricular Wall Vibrations Caused by Poststenotic...,"Siddhartha Sikdar, Xue-Qiao Zhao, Kirk Beach",2008/1,Journal Echocardiography,"Background: A diastolic coronary flow murmur has been reported for patients with coronary stenoses, yet is rarely appreciated during routine auscultation. We hypothesized that an ultrasonic Doppler method can detect the epicardial vibrations associated with this murmur. Ultrasonic Doppler vibrometry is a pulsed wave echocardiography phase demodulation technique designed for detecting vibrations. We correlated the vibration characteristics measured using vibrometry with the angiographic severity of coronary artery stenosis.",

Ultrasonic image is useful for plaque diagnosis because IMT (Intimal-Media Thickness) which is estimated from the thickness of inner membrane of vessels is one of the important values for plaque evaluation. However the image quality of inner membrane is not enough to estimate IMT. We have investigated a Motion-compensated Frame-accumulation Method (MFM) which is based on accumulating multiple subsequent frames acquired from the US scanner. By applying MFM to B-mode image of carotid arteries, inner membrane could be clearly imaged and IMT could be easily estimated. Additionally, we optimized several parameters of MFM for real time performance using MAP processor. The highest frame rate using single MAP processor was estimated to be 24 per second.",
Ultrasonic imaging of myocardial vibrations associated with coronary artery disease,"S Sikdar, KW Beach, SL Goldberg, TR Zwink, LI Baughman, Y Kim",2006/1/17,Conference 2005 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology 27th Annual Conference,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of mortality in the western world. Although progress has been made in recent years for the noninvasive diagnosis of CAD, a widely available, inexpensive and effective diagnostic solution remains elusive. We have developed a novel ultrasound-based technology to detect and analyze the myocardial vibrations associated with diastolic murmurs produced by CAD. Conventional ultrasound imaging systems suppress these vibrations. We have developed algorithms to process the raw ultrasound data and isolate these vibrations and integrated them into a programmable ultrasound system for real-time vibration imaging. In preliminary results from clinical studies of patients with CAD, we have observed localized areas of vibrations in the neighborhood of the stenosed coronary artery. The vibrations are narrowband with frequency >200 Hz, and appear to have harmonic …",
Ultrasonic characterization of soft tissue vibrations based on the two‐dimensional Fourier transform,"Siddhartha Sikdar, Yongmin Kim, Kirk W Beach",2005/9,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"It has recently been demonstrated that soft tissue vibrations in the body, traditionally associated with vascular bruits and cardiac murmurs, can potentially be used for the ultrasonic diagnosis of coronary artery disease and vascular trauma. In this paper, the ultrasonic spectrum of soft tissue vibrations is formulated using the two‐dimensional Fourier transform, making full use of the information present in the backscattered ultrasound echoes from vibrating tissue. Parametric simulation studies show that vibrations with amplitude 1 μm may be detected even with tissue velocity of 20 cm/s and acceleration of 5 m/s2, e.g., during peak cardiac motion. Vibrations with amplitude as low as 0.1 μm may be detected when the tissue acceleration is negligible, e.g., during mid‐diastole. Also, it was found that tissue vibrations in a direction transverse to the ultrasound beam can be detected. In vivo examples of cardiac wall …",
Ultrasonic imaging of flow-induced vibrations in tissue,Siddhartha Sikdar,2005,Institution University of Washington,"The invention of the stethoscope marked the beginning of the era of modern clinical diagnosis. Clinicians learned to recognize disease by listening for sounds known as bruits and murmurs caused by abnormal blood flow in the heart and the circulatory system. Even after two centuries, these sounds continue to be important early indicators of diseases such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, valvular disease, renovascular hypertension, aneurysms, peripheral artery disease and vascular trauma. Modern medical imaging technology has provided the ability to noninvasively image the anatomic and blood flow characteristics associated with various diseases. However, the vascular sounds that were the traditional cornerstone of diagnosis have largely been ignored in medical imaging thus far.",
Media processor programming interface to increase the portability of media processor software,"Michael S Grow, Siddhartha Sikdar, Donglok Kim, Yongmin Kim",2001/3/29,Conference Media Processors 2001,"The architecture of mediaprocessors has become increasingly sophisticated to accommodate the need for more performance in processing various media data. However, due to the inability of mediaprocessor compilers to fully detect the parallelism available in a program and maximize the utilization of the mediaprocessor's on-chip resources, C intrinsics, which are hints to the compiler on which assembly instructions to use, have been employed to achieve better performance. Nonetheless, these intrinsics are mediaprocessor-dependent, thus limiting the portability of mediaprocessor software. To help increase the portability of mediaprocessor software, we have developed a Mediaprocessor Programming Interface (MPI), which translates one set of C intrinsics into another. In many cases, the translated code for the target mediaprocessor has similar performance to the code developed with native intrinsics. We …",

P1E-8 Ultrasonic Doppler Measurement of Tissue Vibrations: Opportunities and Limitations,"Y Kim, KW Beach, S Sikdar, B Zhuang, M Zaccardi, D Leotta",2006/10/2,Conference 2006 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium,"Doppler measurement of tissue vibrations (ultrasonic vibrometry) can provide clinical information about vascular pathology that may be otherwise difficult to obtain using conventional duplex ultrasound. Vibrometry can provide improved sensitivity, since the scattering strength from tissue is significantly higher than that from blood. In addition, detection of tissue vibrations has reduced angle dependency and does not require visualization of the vessel lumen, making the exam less dependent on operator skill and less time-consuming. The fundamental sources of error that can affect the measurement accuracy of the vibration characteristics are Doppler spectral broadening and tissue acceleration. Parametric simulation studies analyzing the effect of these sources of error and their implications are presented. We also present preliminary results from renal artery stenosis (RAS), demonstrating that a diagnosis based on …",2

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether MTI is applicable to power Doppler and B-mode imaging. It was found that image qualities improved in each case. The motion artifact of a power Doppler image of rabbit kidney was reduced without blurring the image. Also, in the B-mode image of a human carotid artery, the inner membrane was clearly imaged, which is not possible with conventional imaging.

Analysis and classification of individual digit movements in ultrasound images,"E Eastlake, J Devanathan, A Shin, H Rangwala, S Sikdar","Materials and Methods: A single-element ultrasound transducer (Interson Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) that connects to a computer via a USB interface was used for imaging. The transducer was attached to the arm of ten healthy subjects using a cuff to keep the transducer in place. Subjects were asked to contract each individual digit in a fast flexion (24 contractions/min), a slow flexion (20 contractions/min), and at large and small angles. In addition, complex finger movements, such as pinching, grasping, and clenching were also recorded. The data collection, on ten healthy subjects, yielded records of 33 different types of movements, with an average of 6-7 instances of each movement per patient. In total, 2,084 movements, distributed across 33 types and 10 patients, were recorded and processed (Fig. 1).A data-mining approach using a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm was developed to identify ‘novel’movements based on a database of existing ones. The nearest neighbor algorithm classifies movements based on the k closest training examples in the database. Nearest-neighbor pair-wise similarity was computed between the images of movement patterns. We experimented with using a correlation coefficient and a warping-based correlation approach. The algorithm was implemented in MATLAB.","Scholar articles Analysis and classification of individual digit movements in ultrasound imagesE Eastlake, J Devanathan, A Shin, H Rangwala…","Materials and Methods: A single-element ultrasound transducer (Interson Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) that connects to a computer via a USB interface was used for imaging.

Wireless Doppler Ultrasound Instrument for Quantifying Muscle Kinematics,"AS Gunda, JJ Esquivel, S Mohammed, B Wooley, S Sikdar","Materials and Methods: An 8MHz continuous-wave vascular Doppler probe (Bistos Co., Ltd, Seongnam, Republic of Korea) was used. The received modulated RF signal was fed into a custom built I/Q demodulator circuit to detect positive and negative phase Doppler shifts. The output of the demodulator was sampled using an Atmel Atmega128rfa1 microcontroller and the data were sent wirelessly to a local host computer hooked up to a receiving microcontroller unit. The receiving microcontroller communicates with MATLAB on the host computer via an RS232 serial connection and transfers recorded data in real time. The Doppler probe and demodulator unit were tested on an experimental Doppler phantom (JJ&A Instruments, Duvall, WA) consisting of a string moving at calibrated velocities. The recorded Doppler shift was extracted at 4 different string speeds. A spectrogram of the received Doppler signal was computed on MATLAB to test the accuracy of the recordings. This system can be extended to include multiple Doppler probes for multi-dimensional velocity estimation. Two Doppler probes were separately housed on a wearable cuff (as seen in Fig 1D) for preliminary in vivo experiments.Results and Discussion: The accuracy of the wireless unit is dependent on the distance between the two MCUs. The data transmission error was< 5% for a distance of 5ft. In the string Phantom tests, Doppler shifts were visible in both the forward and reverse string directions.

The long term goal of this project is to develop subjectspecific biomechanical models informed by dynamic imaging and electromyographic (EMG) data to understand why specific regions of the neck muscles are vulnerable to local injury and to abnormal stretching during activities of daily living, and whether such injuries can cause biomechanical changes that perpetuate asymmetric loading of the neck muscles.Our research group has been investigating the pathogenesis and pathophyiological mechanisms of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in the upper trapezius muscle. MTrPs appear as firm tender nodules on palpation and have been associated with myofascial pain syndrome [1]. In order to understand the mechanical causes and consequences of MTrPs, we design experiments to collect kinematic, muscle EMG, ultrasound imaging, and clinical data from controlled subjects and patients with neck pain who have symptomatic MTrPs. We develop subject-specific musculoskeletal models based on the acquired data which can predict muscle and joint forces during various movements. Through computational simulation and quantitative analysis, we can then investigate whether there is difference (1) in muscle activities,(2) muscle actions, and (3) joint loads between two groups of subjects and whether there is any correlation between these parameters and asymmetric cervical range of motion observed from neck pain patients.
