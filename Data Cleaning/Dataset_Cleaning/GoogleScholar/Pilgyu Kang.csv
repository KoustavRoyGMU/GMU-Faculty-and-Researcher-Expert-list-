"Mechanically self-assembled, three-dimensional graphene–gold hybrid nanostructures for advanced nanoplasmonic sensors","Juyoung Leem, Michael Cai Wang, Pilgyu Kang, SungWoo Nam",2015/11/11,Journal Nano letters,"Hybrid structures of graphene and metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been actively investigated as higher quality surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates. Compared with SERS substrates, which only contain metal NPs, the additional graphene layer provides structural, chemical, and optical advantages. However, the two-dimensional (2D) nature of graphene limits the fabrication of the hybrid structure of graphene and NPs to 2D. Introducing three-dimensionality to the hybrid structure would allow higher detection sensitivity of target analytes by utilizing the three-dimensional (3D) focal volume. Here, we report a mechanical self-assembly strategy to enable a new class of 3D crumpled graphene–gold (Au) NPs hybrid nanoplasmonic structures for SERS applications.

However, CPCs' response to strain is difficult to quantify without the use of optical spectroscopy. Integration of flexible electrical readout of CPCs' color change is a challenge due to a lack of flexible/stretchable electrical transducers. This work details a colorimetric strain sensor with optoelectrical quantification based on an integrated system of CPCs over a crumpled graphene phototransducer, which optoelectrically quantifies CPCs, response to strain. The hybrid system enables direct visual perception of strain, while strain quantification via electrical measurement of the hybrid system outperforms that of crumpled graphene strain sensors by more than 100 times.

Nanophotonic detection of freely interacting molecules on a single influenza virus,"Pilgyu Kang, Perry Schein, Xavier Serey, Dakota O’Dell, David Erickson",2015/7/10,Journal Scientific Reports,"Biomolecular interactions, such as antibody-antigen binding, are fundamental to many biological processes. At present, most techniques for analyzing these interactions require immobilizing one or both of the interacting molecules on an assay plate or a sensor surface. This is convenient experimentally but can constrain the natural binding affinity and capacity of the molecules, resulting in data that can deviate from the natural free-solution behavior. Here we demonstrate a label-free method for analyzing free-solution interactions between a single influenza virus and specific antibodies at the single particle level using near-field optical trapping and light-scattering techniques. We determine the number of specific antibodies binding to an optically trapped influenza virus by analyzing the change of the Brownian fluctuations of the virus.

Here we show that the strain-resilient electrical performance of thin-film metal electrodes under multimodal deformation can be enhanced by using a two-dimensional interlayer. Insertion of atomically thin interlayers—graphene, molybdenum disulfide or hexagonal boron nitride—induces continuous in-plane crack deflection in thin-film metal electrodes.
