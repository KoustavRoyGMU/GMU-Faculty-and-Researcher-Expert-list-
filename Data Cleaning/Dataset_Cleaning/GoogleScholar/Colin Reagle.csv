Measuring the coefficient of restitution of high speed microparticle impacts using a PTV and CFD hybrid technique,"Colin J Reagle, Jacob M Delimont, Wing F Ng, Srinath V Ekkad, VP Rajendran",2013/9/4,Journal Measurement science and technology,"A novel particle tracking velocimetry (PTV)/computational fluid dynamics (CFD) hybrid method for measuring coefficient of restitution (COR) has been developed which is relatively simple, cost-effective, and robust. A laser and camera system is used in the Virginia Tech Aerothermal Rig to measure velocity trajectories of microparticles. The method solves for particle impact velocity at the impact surface using a CFD solution and Lagrangian particle tracking. The methodology presented here attempts to characterize a difficult problem by a combination of established techniques, PTV and CFD, which have not been used in this capacity before. Erosion and deposition are functions of particle/wall interactions and COR is a fundamental property of these interactions. COR depends on impact velocity, angle of impact, temperature, particle composition, and wall material. Two sizes of Arizona road dust and one size of glass …",36
Study of microparticle rebound characteristics under high temperature conditions,"Colin J Reagle, Jacob M Delimont, Wing F Ng, SV Ekkad",2014/1/1,Journal Journal of engineering for gas turbines and power,"Large amounts of tiny microparticles are ingested into gas turbines over their operating life, resulting in unexpected wear and tear. Knowledge of such microparticle behavior at gas turbine operating temperatures is limited in published literature. In this study, Arizona road dust (ARD) is injected into a hot flow field to measure the effects of high temperature and velocity on particle rebound from a polished 304 stainless steel (SS) coupon. The results are compared with baseline (27 m/s) measurements at ambient (300 K) temperature made in the Virginia Tech Aerothermal Rig, as well as previously published literature. Mean coefficient of restitution (COR) was shown to decrease with the increased temperature/velocity conditions in the VT Aerothermal Rig. The effects of increasing temperature and velocity led to a 12% average reduction in COR at 533 K (47 m/s), 15% average reduction in COR at 866 K (77 m/s …",26
Sand transport in a two pass internal cooling duct with rib turbulators,"Sukhjinder Singh, Danesh Tafti, Colin Reagle, Jacob Delimont, Wing Ng, Srinath Ekkad",2014/4/1,Journal International journal of heat and fluid flow,"Jet engines often operate under dirty conditions where large amounts of particulate matter can be ingested, especially, sand, ash and dirt. Particulate matter in different engine components can lead to degradation in performance. The focus of this study is to investigate the sand transport and deposition in the internal cooling passages of turbine blades.",25

An experimental investigation of showerhead film cooling performance in a transonic vane cascade at low and high freestream turbulence,"T Bolchoz, S Nasir, C Reagle, W Ng, HK Moon",2009/1/1,"Conference Turbo Expo: Power for Land, Sea, and Air","This experiment investigates the effects of blowing ratio on the film cooling performance of a showerhead-cooled first-stage turbine vane at low freestream turbulence (Tu = 2%) and an integral length scale normalized by vane pitch (Λx/P) of 0.05. The exit Reynolds number based on vane true chord is 1.1 × 106. The effect of freestream turbulence at high Mach number (Mex = 0.76) and blowing ratio (BR = 0, 1.5, 2.0) is also explored by comparing results with high freestream turbulence measurements (Tu = 16%) previously performed in the same cascade. To characterize film cooling performance, platinum thin-film gauges were used to measure Nusselt number and film cooling effectiveness distributions at the midspan of the vane. Net heat flux reduction is also addressed. The primary effects of coolant injection were augmentation of Nusselt number and reduction of adiabatic wall temperature on the vane surface. In …",10
From idea to prototype: introducing students to entrepreneurship,"Colin Reagle, Viviana Maggioni, Mihai Boicu, Massimiliano Albanese, Mahesh Joshi, Dann Sklarew, Nathalia Peixoto",2017/3/11,Conference 2017 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),"We describe results from a semester-long class taught by seven faculty at George Mason University, aimed at providing resources to engage students in idea generation, design cycle development, and finally elaboration of a business plan. This is intended to alleviate a perceived lack of access for students to commercialize their ideas. Undergraduate and graduate students are often left with unfinished class projects that do not turn into prototypes or products. Here we aim to avoid this outcome (often referred to as the “Valley of Death”). We recruited students with ideas for products as well as students with varied expertise. We have then formalized their engagement by offering a seminar class that met once every other week over a 15 week semester. After the class each team underwent a one-week intensive boot camp for a final demonstration and presentation of their product and business plan. Throughout the …",7
A novel optical technique for measuring the coefficient of restitution of microparticle impacts in a forced flowfield,"CJ Reagle, JM Delimont, WF Ng, SV Ekkad, VP Rajendran",2012/6/11,"Conference Turbo Expo: Power for Land, Sea, and Air","Erosion and deposition in gas turbine engines are functions of particle/wall interactions and Coefficient of Restitution (COR) is a fundamental property of these interactions. COR depends on impact velocity, angle of impact, temperature, particle composition, and wall material. The current study attempts to characterize the fundamental behavior of sand at different impact angles. A PIV system is used in the Virginia Tech Aerothermal Rig to measure velocity trajectories of microparticles. A novel method is used that solves for impact velocity in a forced flowfield by numerical methods. Two sizes of Arizona Test Dust and one of Glass beads are impacted into a 304 Stainless Steel coupon. Free jet velocity is 27m/s at room temperature. Impact angle varies from almost 90 to 25 degrees depending on particle. Mean results compare favorably with trends established in literature. This utilization of this technique to measure …",4
A Transient Infrared Technique for Measuring Surface and Endwall heat Transfer in a Transonic Turbine Cascade,"C Reagle, A Newman, S Xue, W Ng, S Ekkad, HK Moon, L Zhang",2010/10/10,"Conference Turbo Expo: Power for Land, Sea, and Air","This paper describes a method for obtaining surface and endwall heat transfer in an uncooled transonic cascade facility using infrared thermography measurements. Midspan heat transfer coefficient results are first presented for an engine representative first stage nozzle guide vane at exit Mach number of 0.77, Reynolds number of 1.05×106 and freestream turbulence intensity of 16%. The results obtained from infrared thermography are compared with previously published results using thin film gauges in the same facility on the same geometry. There is generally good agreement between the two measurement techniques in both trend and overall level of heat transfer coefficient over the vane surface.

Heat Transfer Measurements Using Thin Film Gauges and Infrared Thermography on a Film Cooled Transonic Vane,Colin James Reagle,2009/5/4,Institution Virginia Tech,"This work presents a comparison of thin film gauge (TFG) and infrared (IR) thermography measurement techniques to simultaneously determine heat transfer coefficient and film cooling effectiveness.  The first comparison was with an uncooled vane where heat transfer coefficient was measured at Mex=0.77 and Tu=16%.  Relatively good agreement was found between the results of the two methods and the effect of recovery temperature and data reduction time was analyzed.  Improvements were made to the experimental set up for the next comparison, a showerhead film cooled vane. This geometry was tested at BR=0, 2.0, Mex=0.76 and Tu=16%.  The TFG and IR results did not compare well for heat transfer coefficient or film cooling effectiveness.  The effects of measured and calculated recovery temperature were analyzed as well as the respective data reduction methods, though the analysis could not account for the effectiveness trend seen on the suction surface.  Finally, a vane with showerhead and shaped film cooling holes were presented at BR=0, 1.7, 2.0, 2.8, Mex=0.85, and Tu=13% to assess a new film cooling geometry measured with the IR technique.  Similarities on the suction surface trend between the different film cooled geometries tested with IR indicate a flaw in the experiment that will require further analysis, changes and testing to complete the comparison with TFG.",2
Teaching in a World of Ubiquitous Data Access,"Rebecca Ericson, Jonathan Goldman, T Mills Kelly, Star Muir, Colin Reagle",2016/7/15,Journal Innovations in Teaching & Learning Conference Proceedings,"TodayÃ¢ â¬ â¢ s students are Ã¢ â¬ Ådigital nativesÃ¢ â¬ Â, having grown up with ready access to the internet and thus to a world of information. Do we still expect our students to memorize facts and formulae in this new era or should we be exploring new ways to prepare them for their chosen professions and to function in our participatory democracy? What should be taught Ã¢ â¬ â dates, names, workplace skills, ways of thinking, learning skills Ã¢ â¬ â and how? And how can we better assess that learning? A panel of four faculty members, representing the sciences, history, communication, and engineering, will discuss how their teaching and assessment methodologies have changed in response to technological advances affecting students.

QUALITATIVE STUDY OF PARTICLE IMPACT PATTERNS WITHIN TURBINE BLADE COOLING PASSAGES,"Adam Shoemaker, M Fertall, C Reagle, J Delimont, W Ng","Gas turbine engines feature a large combination of precisely machined interacting components. Likewise, the stability and efficiency of gas turbines is directly dependent on the condition of these components within the engine. As particles such as dust, sand, ash, etc. enter into the engine, a series of erosive and depositional processes occur. Often unavoidable, these occurrences directly influence many of the engine’s components, causing mechanical breakdown. In the event of breakdown, the ability of the engine to operate can be drastically influenced. In mild cases, the efficiency will be lowered causing excessive fuel usage, whereas in the most extreme cases total engine failure may result in a compromise to safety. Previous work at Virginia Tech has yielded Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models predicting the behavior of particles flowing within a two pass blade cooling channel. This paper presents work done in qualitative experiments aimed at reproducing the results of the CFD models. It will start with a background that details relative events as well as particular research in this area. From this background, the team developed an appropriate experiment to validate the CFD models which will be used for comparison at a later date.","Scholar articles QUALITATIVE STUDY OF PARTICLE IMPACT PATTERNS WITHIN TURBINE BLADE COOLING PASSAGESA Shoemaker, M Fertall, C Reagle, J Delimont, W Ng","Gas turbine engines feature a large combination of precisely machined interacting components.
