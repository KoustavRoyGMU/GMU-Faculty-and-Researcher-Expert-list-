18205,18205,hoda hassan,the everincreasing dependence on the internet is challenged by several factors impeding the smooth transition to the nomadic and ubiquitous future communications these hindering factors are primarily attributed to the topdown approach in designing computer networks that resulted in adopting a layered architecture for abstracting network functionalities as well as for engineering protocols a methodology that proved to be neither adaptable nor evolvable in response to changes in network operational requirements and technological advancements this paper presents a bottomup strategy for designing computer networks through i the formalization of network design core principles ii the derivation of a conceptual framework for network concerns and a structural model for network building elements inspired by natural complex systems thus introducing the network cell which is the network elementary building block intrinsically capable of specialization adaptation and evolution and iii finally a cellbased network realization cellbased network adaptation capabilities are evaluated through simulations results show the awareness of hdp and tcp to path delays and the possibility of tweaking their operation accordingly,cellnet a bottomup approach to network design,1-Dec-09,N/A,N/A,LinkedIn Publication
18206,18206,hoda hassan,the layered internet architecture that had long guided network design and protocol engineering was an interconnection architecture defining a framework for interconnecting networks rather than a model for generic network structuring and engineering we claim that the approach of abstracting the network in terms of an internetwork hinders the thorough understanding of the network salient characteristics and emergent behavior resulting in impeding design evolution required to address extreme scale heterogeneity and complexity this paper reports on our work in progress that aims to 1 investigate the problem space in terms of the factors and decisions that influenced the design and development of computer networks 2 sketch the core principles for designing complex computer networks and 3 propose a model and related framework for building evolvable adaptable and self organizing networks we will adopt a bottom up strategy primarily focusing on the building unit of the network model which we call the network cell the model is inspired by natural complex systems a network cell is intrinsically capable of specialization adaptation and evolution subsequently we propose cellnet a framework for evolvable network design we outline scenarios for using the cellnet framework to enhance legacy internet protocol stack,towards a framework for evolvable network design,1-Nov-09,N/A,N/A,LinkedIn Publication
18207,18207,hoda hassan,the layered architecture that guided the design of the internet is deemed inadequate as a reference model for engineering protocols for ngn layered protocol suites impose a strict sequential order on protocol execution conflicting with the efficient engineering of end systems as well as failing to express vertical functional integration the separation of control and data planes and the distributed nature of network functions furthermore protocols developed according to the layered architecture are implemented as monolithic blocks with undefined or implicit dependencies lacking flexibility to adapt to changing application requirements we claim that ngn architecture design should be dual faceted along a vertical and a horizontal dimension the vertical dimension addresses complexity at a network node by abstracting the communication functionality into several components and defining component interactions while the horizontal dimension addresses the distributed nature of the network abstracting network links into communication paths and defining procedures for creating maintaining as well as exchanging data between different network components along these paths we propose a preliminary network architecture based on component federation we focus on the vertical decomposition of the communication functions and their interactions considering the distributed consequences of these interactions along the horizontal dimension of the network,towards a federated network architecture,1-Apr-08,N/A,N/A,LinkedIn Publication
