nanobotbased treatments for pulmonary infections before joining the george mason university i was a senior research fellow for two years at the the centre for excellence in nanoelectronics theranostic devices centd indian institute of technology guwahati india i worked on synthesis of biomedical microrobots for anticancer therapy i earned my phd nanotechnology at the indian institute of technology guwahati in 2018 and my doctoral research was on designing micronanobots for applications in medicine energy and water treatment being the first generation of student in a startup lab i got a rare opportunity to set up the lab to develop establish new protocols for micronanobots fabrication from my phd i have the proven ability to deliver impactful innovative results which led to high impact publications through collaboration with other labs i have succeeded in material characterization using dls uv afm sem ftir raman xrd vsm tem techniques i have proven experience in managing projects and meeting critical deadlines to ensure project completion i am highly skilled in mentorship of new undergraduates and postgraduates in their final year projectsthesis i have received multiple awards including gandhian young technological innovation sristigyti award 2019 and dstserb international travel grant award 2016prior to my doctoral studies i completed my masters and bachelors in biotechnology from heritage institute of technology india i am familiar with analytical techniques like dna cloning dna purification dna gel analysis dnarna blotting enzymatic assays gram staining microscopy antibiotic assay solid and liquid cultures bacterial growth curve biochemical characterization of bacteria bioinformatics i possess strong written and oral communication skills have a keen attention to detail and the ability to work autonomously as well as in collaborative environments apart from conducting experiments and analyzing data i am an ardent illustrator and sketch artist a
