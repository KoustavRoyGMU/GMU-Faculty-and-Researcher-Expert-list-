 ",703-993-4078,"Engineering solutions for deadly conditions: According to the American Heart Association, about 1.5 to 5% of the general population has or will develop a cerebral aneurysm. That means that about 3-5 million people in the US have cerebral aneurysms, but most produce no symptoms. However, as people age or experience lifestyle changes, the structure of the aneurysm can stretch, burst, or tear, causing dangerous bleeding. Juan R. Cebral works diligently researching advances in image-based patient-specific computational modeling of cerebral blood flow in order for clinicians to better diagnose and address urgently life-threatening conditions. As a PhD alumnus of George Mason University in Computational Sciences and Informatics, Cebral embodies the vision of “Farther, Faster.” Originally from the Patagonia region of Argentina, Cebral collaborates with medical clinicians at Fairfax INOVA Hospitals, and with hospitals and institutions around the world. The National Institutes of Health, the American Heart Association, the Whitaker Foundation, as well as industrial partners such as Philips Healthcare and Boston Scientific have funded his research.
