0,Alok Berry,"Associate Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering and Computing",703-993-1606," When Alok Berry earned his MS in physics in 1969, the evolution of circuitry computing was picking up speed as it moved beyond individual chips to more complex microprocessors. To this day, key areas of interest for Berry are semiconductors and new electronic materials. Berry engages this knowledge with students in courses covering electromagnetic theory, linear electronics, and circuit analysis. He has been a teaching fellow and research assistant at the University of Missouri, and a lecturer in Physics at the University of Delhi. Berry joined George Mason University in fall 1985 as an assistant professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and became an associate professor in 1991. The National Science Foundation awarded Berry $239K in 2012. His project, the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP), works to improve diversity demographics among minority STEM participation. In August 2017,  Berry received additional funding from NSF for $309,950.00 for the third five-year phase of the LSAMP program.  ","Electronics,","PhD, Electrical Engineerint,  University of Missouri

4,Krzysztof Gaj,Professor and Associate Chair for Graduate Studies,703-993-1575," Krzysztof (Kris) Gaj received the MSc and PhD in Electrical Engineering from Warsaw University of Technology. He is a professor in the ECE Department at Mason, where he currently co-directs the Cryptographic Engineering Research Group – CERG - one of the largest and most widely recognized applied-cryptography groups in the United States. His major research projects have been devoted to the evaluation of cryptographic algorithms competing to become new American and international standards. Gaj and his team compare these ciphers from the point of view of their performance in hardware and embedded systems. His work was instrumental in selecting Rijndael as a new Advanced Encryption Standard - AES, and Keccak as a new cryptographic hash function standard – SHA-3. He also played a major role in performing and coordinating benchmarking of over 25 authenticated ciphers competing in the CAESAR contest. He is currently involved in evaluating candidates for two new U.S. federal standards in the areas of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Lightweight Cryptography (LWC). The former of these two standards is related to the rise of quantum computers, which may one day wipe out the majority of modern cryptography as we know it. As a result, researchers, such as Gaj, are working right now to find a suitable replacement. In his college years, Gaj wrote a book on the German Enigma machine and the techniques and machines used to break Hitler's code before and during World War II. Although his research interests shifted afterward to modern cryptography, he still incorporates Enigma's story into his classes on encryption and codebreaking. Gaj leads students to greater understanding and acuity in cryptographic engineering, advanced digital system design, software/hardware codesign, and electronic design automation in a variety of senior and graduate courses. Beyond the classroom, Gaj interacts with numerous international professionals and academic communities in his field of research.

A good example is to imagine a single human operator trying to control a swarm of 1000 robots. It is impossible for the human to send individual commands to each robot, but rather the human should send a high level command to the entire swarm. It is then up to the individual robots in the swarm to determine how to locally move within the swarm to ensure completion of the global task. A large motivation for the specific challenges he is interested in include minimizing energy or wireless communication, efficient computation of control strategies or decisions, and the use of sparse sensing and/or control.
