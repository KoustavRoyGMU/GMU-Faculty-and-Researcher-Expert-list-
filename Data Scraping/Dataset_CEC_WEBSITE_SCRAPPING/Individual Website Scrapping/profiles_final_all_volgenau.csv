He is a professor in the ECE Department at Mason, where he currently co-directs the Cryptographic Engineering Research Group – CERG - one of the largest and most widely recognized applied-cryptography groups in the United States. His major research projects have been devoted to the evaluation of cryptographic algorithms competing to become new American and international standards. Gaj and his team compare these ciphers from the point of view of their performance in hardware and embedded systems. His work was instrumental in selecting Rijndael as a new Advanced Encryption Standard - AES, and Keccak as a new cryptographic hash function standard – SHA-3. He also played a major role in performing and coordinating benchmarking of over 25 authenticated ciphers competing in the CAESAR contest. He is currently involved in evaluating candidates for two new U.S. federal standards in the areas of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Lightweight Cryptography (LWC). The former of these two standards is related to the rise of quantum computers, which may one day wipe out the majority of modern cryptography as we know it. As a result, researchers, such as Gaj, are working right now to find a suitable replacement. In his college years, Gaj wrote a book on the German Enigma machine and the techniques and machines used to break Hitler's code before and during World War II. Although his research interests shifted afterward to modern cryptography, he still incorporates Enigma's story into his classes on encryption and codebreaking. Gaj leads students to greater understanding and acuity in cryptographic engineering, advanced digital system design, software/hardware codesign, and electronic design automation in a variety of senior and graduate courses. Beyond the classroom, Gaj interacts with numerous international professionals and academic communities in his field of research.

28,Rajesh Ganesan,"Associate Professor, Systems Engineering and Operations Research, College of Engineering and Computing",703-993-1693," Operations research deals with the application of advanced mathematics and computational methods to help make better decisions involving large and complex systems. There are many uses for operations research, but one of the most difficult problems that Rajesh Ganesan investigates is the sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. His operations research applications include decision making in cybersecurity, defense, health care and air traffic management. Ganesan focuses his research at the Center for Secure Information Systems on dynamic allocation of cybersecurity analyst resource to detect intrusions and maintain a desirable level of operational effectiveness. In one of his recent papers, he provided a framework for establishing and maintaining an effective cybersecurity analyst workforce to minimize cybersecurity risk.  His health care research work addresses a very important public policy and ethical problem: who, among those waiting, should be selected for a liver transplant, not only minimizing geographical disparity in access to livers but also extending organ life.   In a recent paper, Ganesan explored the use of a fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) model for determining convoy schedules and route clearance assignments in light of attack dangers faced by transportation networks where improvised explosive device (IED) attacks are common. There is an exigent need for a timely solution to this dangerous and enduring problem faced by US military personnel. Ganesan’s research has offered opportunities for meaningful improvements to the safety of convoys using RL algorithms; the same research could one day be applied to other safety and risk management processes in the civilian environment. At the Center for Air Transportation Systems Research (CATSR), Ganesan’s research is focused on air traffic management issues such as minimizing taxi waiting-time in busy airports. This work is very important due to the huge economic impact of delayed and cancelled flights on all stakeholders of the air transportation industry. Mason’s CATSR was founded in 2003. Its Air Transportaion Laboratory provides a program of cutting-edge research, development, and education in the area of modern air transportation management.

Most recently he was a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University. Previous to this he was a Research Mechanical Engineer at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C., where he was head of the Fluid Dynamics Section in the Remote Sensing Division. Throughout his career Dr. Handler has been actively involved in the study of turbulent fluid flows. His main achievement in this area was to uncover the fundamental structure of turbulent flows near the surfaces of ships or jet aircraft. The puzzling phenomenon of drag reduction associated with the injection of small amounts of polymer into turbulent flows of liquids has been a major focus of his work. He and his collaborators were the first to simulate this phenomenon using advanced computational methods. This knowledge might be used in the future to design optimal drag reducing agents, resulting in significant energy savings. In general, Dr. Handler gets his greatest pleasure by trying to understand phenomena which are currently poorly understood and counterintuitive. Along these lines, he has recently received an NSF grant to study the very puzzling phenomenon of fluid turbulence appearing in low speed flows caused by fluid elasticity.

A good example is to imagine a single human operator trying to control a swarm of 1000 robots. It is impossible for the human to send individual commands to each robot, but rather the human should send a high level command to the entire swarm. It is then up to the individual robots in the swarm to determine how to locally move within the swarm to ensure completion of the global task. A large motivation for the specific challenges he is interested in include minimizing energy or wireless communication, efficient computation of control strategies or decisions, and the use of sparse sensing and/or control.
