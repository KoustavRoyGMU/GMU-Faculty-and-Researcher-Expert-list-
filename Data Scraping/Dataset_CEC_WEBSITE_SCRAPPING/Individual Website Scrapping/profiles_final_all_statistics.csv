7,Ilhan Izmirli,"Associate Professor
 ",703-993-5168," Ilhan Izmirli grew up surrounded by books and a profound sense of deference for education, a practice, which, according to Oscar Wilde (1854 – 1900), “makes one rogue cleverer than another.” To Izmirli, the pursuit of knowledge is at once esoteric and abstract for the sole purpose of attaining intellectual maturity, cultural sensitivity, and social consciousness. As he continued academic study, he was equally attracted to literature, mathematics, music, and physics and was having a hard time deciding which one of these disciplines to study in college. Before graduating from high school, Izmirli was exposed to the vast universality of mathematics. The infiniteness that arose from relatively simple situations left him enthralled with serious computation. Inspired by his first encounter with tessellation of planar mathematics and its application in natural studies, Izmirli has devoted his research to mathematics and statistics education; philosophy of mathematics; philosophy of science; history of mathematics; relations between mathematics and other disciplines such as physics, philosophy, and music; and chaos theory. He has presented numerous papers on these and related topics in international conferences throughout the world.
