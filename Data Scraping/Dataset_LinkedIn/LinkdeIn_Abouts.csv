14,Niloofar Ramezani,"   I hold a PhD and a master's degree in applied statistics (and research methods), as well as a bachelor's degree in statistics (minor in mathematics). I am interested in conducting statistical and interdisciplinary research and teaching courses in statistics, research methods, and data analytics. I have over a decade of experience as a senior statistician, consultant, and biostatistician, working with multiple state agencies. I currently serve as co-investigator and co-PI on multiple projects, funded by NIH and other grant agencies, focusing on developing and applying statistical methodology, and machine learning techniques, to improve quality of life, mainly among vulnerable populations. My recent applied studies focus on mental health, justice and policy, and different areas of biomedicine. My main areas of methodological interest are power analysis, longitudinal and correlated studies, joint models, survival and recurrent event analysis, and their application in health, social, and educational data. I am a two-time recipient of SAS Ambassador Award for innovative use of statistical analysis software, as well as junior faculty SAS award, and have earned over two dozen competitive academic awards through SAS, APHA, ASA, and others, for my research in statistical modeling including developing two new power estimation techniques for longitudinal data. I am passionate in handling missing data, efficiently modeling correlated and multilevel data, and extending generalized estimating equations to capture higher response variation. Such methods are highly applicable in biomedical, social, health, engineering, business, education, and econometric fields. I believe in giving back to the community and have volunteered with nonprofit organizations for multiple years writing grants, evaluating intervention programs, and designing studies and look forward to more volunteer activities.I have over ten years of experience teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in statistics and data analytics, designing courses, and developing curriculum for in-person, hybrid, and fully online courses. My teaching philosophy is to impart my passion for statistics on my students to enable them to solve real-world problems using statistics.

We understand times are challenging for everyone but we believe it is during these times that we must come even closer together to shine some light into this current uncertain reality. That is why we are humbly asking you for help in this endeavor as we tackle world hunger.

I worked on synthesis of biomedical microrobots for anti-cancer therapy. I earned my Ph.D. (Nanotechnology) at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati in 2018 and my doctoral research was on designing micro/nanobots for applications in medicine, energy and water treatment. Being the first generation of student in a start-up lab, I got a rare opportunity to set up the lab & to develop, establish new protocols for micro/nanobots fabrication. From my PhD, I have the proven ability to deliver impactful, innovative results which led to high impact publications. Through collaboration with other labs, I have succeeded in material characterization using DLS, UV, AFM, SEM, FTIR, RAMAN, XRD, VSM, & TEM techniques. I have proven experience in managing projects and meeting critical deadlines to ensure project completion. I am highly skilled in mentorship of new undergraduates and postgraduates in their final year projects/thesis. I have received multiple awards, including Gandhian Young Technological Innovation (SRISTI-GYTI) Award 2019 and DST-SERB International Travel Grant Award 2016.Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my Masters and Bachelors in Biotechnology from Heritage Institute of Technology, India.
