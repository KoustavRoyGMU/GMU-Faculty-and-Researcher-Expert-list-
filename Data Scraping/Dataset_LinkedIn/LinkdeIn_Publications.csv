4,David Rosenblum,Cascading Verification: An Integrated Method for Domain-Specific Model Checking,"Model checking is an established formal method for verifying the desired behavioral properties of system models. But popular model checkers tend to support low-level modeling languages that require intricate models to represent even the simplest systems. Modeling complexity arises in part from the need to encode domain knowledge, including domain objects and concepts, and their relationships, at relatively low levels of abstraction. We will demonstrate that, once formalized, domain knowledge can be reused to enhance the abstraction level of model and property specifications, and the effectiveness of probabilistic model checking.

This paper describes a novel method for domain-specific model checking called cascading verification. The method uses composite reasoning over high-level system specifications and formalized domain knowledge to synthesize both low-level system models and the behavioral properties that need to be verified with respect to those models. In particular, model builders use a high-level domain-specific language (DSL) to encode system specifications that can be analyzed with model checking. Domain knowledge is encoded in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and Prolog, which are combined to overcome their individual limitations. Synthesized models and properties are analyzed with the probabilistic model checker PRISM. Cascading verification is illustrated with a prototype system that verifies the correctness of uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) mission plans. An evaluation of this prototype reveals non-trivial reductions in the size and complexity of input system specifications compared to the artifacts synthesized for PRISM.",1-Aug-13

7,David Rosenblum,Context-aware adaptive applications: fault patterns and their automated identification,"Applications running on mobile devices are intensely context-aware and adaptive. Streams of context values continuously drive these applications, making them very powerful but, at the same time, susceptible to undesired configurations. Such configurations are not easily exposed by existing validation techniques, thereby leading to new analysis and testing challenges. In this paper, we address some of these challenges by defining and applying a new model of adaptive behavior called an Adaptation Finite-State Machine (A-FSM) to enable the detection of faults caused by both erroneous adaptation logic and asynchronous updating of context information, with the latter leading to inconsistencies between the external physical context and its internal representation within an application. We identify a number of adaptation fault patterns, each describing a class of faulty behaviors. Finally, we describe three classes of algorithms to detect such faults automatically via analysis of the A-FSM. We evaluate our approach and the trade-offs between the classes of algorithms on a set of synthetically generated Context-Aware Adaptive Applications (CAAAs) and on a simple but realistic application in which a cell phone's configuration profile changes automatically as a result of changes to the user's location, speed, and surrounding environment.

The architecture of CAAAs is typically layered and incorporates a context-awareness component to support processing of context values and triggering of adaptive changes. While this layered architecture is very natural for the design and implementation of CAAAs, it exhibits new kinds of failures that arise as a result of faults that are specific to the choice of technology for specific layers. In this paper we investigate the occurrence of such faults and failures that manifest across architectural layers, and we describe samples of such failures in four CAAAs.",30-Jun-10

In this paper we present how techniques similar to the ones used in symbolic model checking can be applied to the verification of context-aware and adaptive applications.

The concept of “attack surface” has emerged in recent years as a measure of such vulnerabilities, however systematically quantifying the attack surfaces of networked systems remains an open challenge. In this work we propose a methodology
to both quantify the attack surface and visually represent semantically different components (or resources) of such systems by identifying their dependencies. To illustrate the efficacy of our methodology, we examine two real Internet standards (the X.509 CA verification system and DANE)
as case studies. We believe this work represents a first step towards systemically modeling dependencies of (and interdependencies between) networked systems, and shows the usability benefits from leveraging existing services. ",21-Oct-14
3,Eric Osterweil,Measuring IPv6 Adoption,"The Internet is on the verge of its first fundamentally-disruptive transition—one which will impose extensive change throughout the network. On February 3, 2011 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocated the last unallocated blocks of IPv4 address space to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), accelerating pressure for migration to the next version of the Internet protocol, IPv6. This inflection point offers a unique opportunity to study the adoption of new technologies at an unprecedented scale. In this paper, we provide measurement of this significant transition. Unlike existing studies, which are limited to specific IPv6 characteristics or time scales, our goal is to create a comprehensive and longitudinal picture of IPv6 adoption. Using large, global-scale datasets, we assemble measurements encompassing the important aspects of adoption, including both new and previously-proposed measures. Spanning a period of almost ten years, these metrics include numerous notable adoption milestones, such as the recent World IPv6 Launch event in June of 2012 and the European RIR’s IPv4 address exhaustion in September of that year.",12-Aug-14
4,Eric Osterweil,Verifying Keys through Publicity and Communities of Trust: Quantifying Off-Axis Corroboration,"The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) arguably make DNS the first core Internet system to be protected using public key cryptography. The success of DNSSEC not only protects the DNS, but has generated interest in using this secured global database for new services such as those proposed by the IETF DANE working group. However, continued success is only possible if several important operational issues can be addressed. For example, .gov and .arpa have already suffered misconfigurations where DNS continued to function properly, but DNSSEC failed (thus, orphaning their entire subtrees in DNSSEC). Internet-scale verification systems must tolerate this type of chaos, but what kind of verification can one derive for systems with dynamism like this? In this paper, we propose to achieve robust verification with a new theoretical model, called Public Data, which treats operational deployments as Communities of Trust (CoTs) and makes them the verification substrate. Using a realization of the above idea, called Vantages, we quantitatively show that using a reasonable DNSSEC deployment model and a typical choice of a CoT, an adversary would need to be able to have visibility into and perform on-path Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks on arbitrary traffic into and out of up to 90 percent of the all of the Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet before having even a 10 percent chance of spoofing a DNSKEY. Further, our limited deployment of Vantages has outperformed the verifiability of DNSSEC and has properly validated its data up to 99.5 percent of the time.",1-Feb-14

The attackers hijacked clicks and ad impressions on victim machines infected by a DNS changer malware to earn ad revenue fraudulently. We experimented with the attack infrastructure when it was in operation and present a detailed account of the attackers' modus operandi. We also study the impact of this attack on real-world users and find that 37 subscriber lines were impacted in our data set.

This study uses gTLD data to characterize the DNS resolver population and profile DNS query types. The results show a small and relatively stable set of resolvers (i.e. the top-talkers) constitute 90% of the overall traffic. The results provide a basis for understanding for this critical Internet service, insights on typical resolver behaviors and the use of IPv6 in DNS, and provides a foundation for further study of DNS behavior.",1-Mar-12
8,Eric Osterweil,Reducing the X.509 Attack Surface with DNSSEC's DANE,"For the last decade, perhaps the most commonly used type of end-user security has been the HTTP Secure (HTTPS) protocol employed by web browsers (which runs over the Secure Sockets Layer, SSL or its successor, TLS). In HTTPS, any service (such as a website) may create its own cryptographic certificate to secure its communication channel, and clients use this certificate to verify data from, and transmit data to the server. This model has helped to secure online banking transactions, eCommerce websites, social networking websites, and more. However, two inherent complications to this approach are that clients must have a secure way to learn the authentic certificate for each website before they begin using this protocol, and they must be able to determine if they can trust the named entity that the certificate belongs to. These complications are conflated in today’s security model, which is based on a list of prespecified trusted X.509 Certificate
Authorities (CAs) that every client must know a priori, and a very ad-hoc approach to determining which of this list of CAs will vouch for any keys discovered.

In this paper we first outline some of the fundamental problems that exist with today’s CA model, problems that arise from its conflation of the two inherent complications, and some of the implications and attack vectors that these problems present to the security of this model’s users. Then we introduce some of the relative benefits that can be gained from a new approach being standardized in the IETF called DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE), in which certificate credentials are verified by DNSSEC-enabled zones, rather than the CA model used today. We illustrate that
the DNSSEC-verification model reduces the attack surface that users currently inherit, and show that this model opens avenues that have previously remained elusive (such as a usable S/MIME verification infrastructure).",1-Mar-12

This paper argues that one cannot and should not try to regulate who sells addresses and at what price, but one does need to provide some proof of ownership in the form of resource certification. In this paper we identify key requirements of resource certification, gained from both theoretical analysis and operational history. We further argue these requirements
can be achieved by making use of the existing reverse DNS hierarchy, enhanced with DNS Security. Our analysis compares reverse DNS entries and BGP routing tables and shows this is both feasible and achievable today; an essential requirement as the grey market is also emerging today and solutions are needed now, not years in the future.",1-Nov-11

11,Eric Osterweil,Cross-Modal Vulnerabilities: An Illusive form of Hijacking,"Content, connection, and other types of hijacking are a common occurrence in todayÂ’s Internet. One can broadly classify various types of hijacks as being locally scoped to an administrative domain, or pushed externally; where one administrative domain (intentionally or unintentionally) hijacks users in other domains. Current work in identifying and reacting to various types of Internet hijacking has focused on the network control plane and has not included cross-modal hijacks that involve both the control plane and the data plane of the Internet. In this work we introduce the idea that cross-modal threats exist in the Internet and form a highly illusive, but serious threat. Further, we detail an actual instance of Internet-scale cross-modal hijacking whose behavior depends on both network control data and data plane such as the order in which users request connections. Based on anecdotal evidence gleaned from several websites, it appears that this hijack existed for many months (and possibly years) before its recent detection.",1-Mar-10
12,Eric Osterweil,Deploying Cryptography in Internet-Scale Systems: A Case Study on DNSSEC,"The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are among the first attempts to deploy cryptographic protections in an Internet-scale operational system. DNSSEC applies well-established public key cryptography to ensure data integrity and origin authenticity in the DNS system. While the cryptographic design of DNSSEC is sound and seemingly simple, its development has taken the IETF over a decade and several protocol revisions, and even today its deployment is still in the early stage of rolling out. In this paper, we provide the first systematic examination of the design, deployment, and operational challenges encountered by DNSSEC over the years. Our study reveals a fundamental gap between cryptographic designs and operational Internet systems. To be deployed in the global Internet, a cryptographic protocol must possess several critical properties including scalability, flexibility, incremental deployability, and ability to function in face of imperfect operations. We believe that the insights gained from this study can offer valuable inputs to future cryptographic designs for other Internet-scale systems.",1-Jan-10

We analyze the data collected from the initial DNSSEC deployment which started over 2 years ago, and identify three critical metrics to gauge the deployment: availability, verifiability, and validity. Our results provide the first comprehensive look at DNSSEC’s deployment and reveal a number of challenges that were not anticipated in the design but have become evident in the deployment. First, obstacles such as middle-boxes (firewalls, NATs, etc.) that exist in today’s Internet infrastructure have proven to be problematic and have resulted in unforeseen availability problems. Second, the public-key delegation system of DNSSEC has not evolved as it was hoped and it currently leaves over 97% of DNSSEC zones isolated and unverifiable, unless some external key authentication mechanism is added. Furthermore, our results show that cryptographic verification is not equivalent to validation; a piece of verified data can still contain the wrong value. Finally, our results demonstrate the essential role of monitoring and measurement in the DNSSEC deployment. We believe that the observations and lessons from the DNSSEC deployment can provide insights into measuring future Internet-scale cryptographic systems.",10-Oct-08
17,Eric Osterweil,Limiting Replay Vulnerabilities in DNSSEC,"The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) added public key cryptography to the DNS, but problems remain in selecting signature lifetimes. A zone’s master server distributes signatures to secondary servers. The signatures lifetimes should be long so that a secondary server can still operate if the master fails. However, DNSSEC lacks revocation. Signed data can be replayed until the signature expires and thus zones should select a short signature lifetime. Operators must choose between reduced robustness or long replay vulnerability windows.

This paper introduces a revised DNSSEC signature that allows secondary servers to operate even if the master has failed while simultaneously limiting replay windows to twice the TTL. Each secondary server constructs a hash chain and relays the hash chain anchor to the master server. The signature produced by the master server ensures the authenticity of the hash anchor and the DNS data. A secondary server includes both the signature and a hash chain value used by resolvers to limit signature replay. Our implementation shows the added costs are minimal compared to DNSSEC and ensures robustness against long-term master server failures. At the same time, we limit replay to twice the record TTL value.",1-Oct-08

ZSR enables zones to explicitly revoke keys using self-certifying certificates, and enables DNS name-servers to opportunistically inform distributed caching resolvers of key revocations via lightweight control messages. Further, ZSR allows resolvers to distinguish between legitimate key changes and potential attacks when authentication chains are broken. ZSR is designed to work well with global-scale DNS operations, where millions of caches may need to be informed of a revocation, and where time is critical.",1-Aug-07
20,Eric Osterweil,Security Through Publicity,"Current large-scale authentication and non-repudiation systems offer various security measures, but do not meet the needs of today’s Internet-scale applications. Though several designs exist, there have been no significant deployments of Internet-scale security infrastructures. In this paper we propose a novel concept called the public-space that makes complete information of digital entities’ actions publicly available to every user. It is a structured framework that maintains a large number of entities, their actions, relationships, and histories. Posting such information in public does not endorse the information’s correctness, but it does provide users with a quantifiable set of information that enables them to detect faults and make informed security decisions. Combined with traditional cryptographic techniques, the public-space system can support the intrinsic heterogeneity of user security requirements in Internet-scale infrastructures and applications.",1-Jul-06
21,Eric Osterweil,Lightweight Temporal Compression of Microclimate Datasets,"Since the inception of sensor networks, in-network processing has been touted as the enabling technology for long-lived deployments. Radio communication is the overriding consumer of energy in such networks. There- fore, data reduction before transmission, either by compression or feature extraction, will directly and significantly increase network lifetime.

In many cases, it is premature to begin implementing feature extraction techniques. Users do not yet under- stand in what forms interesting data will appear and consequently can’t risk automatically discarding what they presume to be uninteresting. Moreover, computer scientists are only beginning to develop algorithms to collect spatially distributed features in situ.

Even for the many application where all of the data must be transported out of the network, data may be com- pressed before transport, so long as the chosen compression technique can operate under the stringent resource constraints of low-power nodes and induces only tolerable errors. This paper evaluates a simple temporal compression scheme designed specifically to be used by mica motes for the compaction of microclimate data. The algorithm makes use of the observation that over a small enough window of time, samples of microclimate data are linear. It finds such windows and generates a series of line segments that accurately represent the data. It compresses data up to 20-to-1 while introducing error on the order of the sensor hardware’s specified margin of error. Further-
more it is simple, consumes little CPU and requires very little storage when compared to other compression techniques. This paper describes the technique and results using a dataset from a one-year microclimate deployment.",1-Nov-04

Due to the lack of women in technology, many efforts are being made to expose girls to computer programming at an early age. Code camp organizers are using the all-girl model to help put participants more at ease and boost their computing confidence. High computer self-efficacy leads to studying computer science, while the stereotypical views of coding as a male subject and lack of ability in girls hinder women from pursuing CS degrees. For this study, a local Northern Virginia University offered two Java programming summer code camps in the summer of 2016, one course as an all-girl class and the other as a co-ed environment. A total of 19 girls participated and submitted post-workshop survey responses. In this paper, we explore the questionnaire differences in response between the girls within the two groups. The implications of introducing computer science to girls in a single-sex setting and its effect on girls' view of CS and computer self-efficacy is also discussed.",11-Mar-17

The vendor diversity on the market accentuates the need to make these systems interoperable, i.e., able to compare fingerprints collected using different devices with comparable high accuracy.
In this paper, we propose a learning-based scheme for enhancing interoperability between optical fingerprint sensors. Different features (i.e. image quality, texture) and signal domains (space and frequency) are utilized to compensate for the variations in cross-sensor recognition performance of a commercial matcher.
Specifically, we consider Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF) and characteristics derived from the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).
DWT is able to preserve spatial information of an image when performing frequency analysis while BSIF has shown to be an effective local descriptor for images with unusual characteristics. Experiments are carried out on a data set consisting of fingerprints obtained from 494 users acquired using four different optical devices. Results show a significant reduction in error rates compared to the baseline as well as improved performance compared to previous research.",The 15th International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group BIOSIG 2016

In this study, we examine Big (Social) Data consisting of nearly fourteen million tweets collected from the Twitter platform over a period of ten months to analyze public opinion regarding GBV, highlighting the nature of tweeting practices by geographical location and gender. The exploitation of Big Data requires the techniques of Computational Social Science to mine insight from the corpus while accounting for the influence of both transient events and sociocultural factors.

1,Hemant Purohit,Intent Classification of Short-text Social Media,"Social media platforms facilitate the emergence of citizen communities that discuss real-world events, and generate/share content with a variety of intent ranging from social good (e.g., volunteering to help) to commercial interest (e.g., criticizing product features). Hence, mining intent from social data can aid in filtering social media to support organizations, such as an emergency management unit for resource planning. However, effective intent mining is inherently challenging due to ambiguity in interpretation, and sparsity of relevant behaviors in social data. In this research, we address the problem of multiclass classification of intent with a use-case of social data generated during crisis events. Our novel interdisciplinary method exploits a hybrid feature representation created by combining top-down processing using knowledge-guided patterns with bottom-up processing using a bag-of-tokens model.

2,Hemant Purohit,Assisting Coordination during Crisis: A Domain Ontology based Approach to Infer Resource Needs from Tweets,"Ubiquitous social media during crises provides citizen reports on the situation, needs and supplies. Previous research extracts resource needs directly from the text (e.g. “Power cut to Coney Island and Brighton beach” indicates a power need). This approach assumes that citizens derive and write about specific needs from their observations, properly specified for the emergency response system, an assumption that is not consistent with general conversational behavior. In our study, Twitter messages (tweets) from Hurricane Sandy in 2012 clearly indicate power blackouts, but not their probable implications (e.g. loss of power to hospital life support systems). We use a domain model to capture such interdependencies between resources and needs. We represent these dependencies in an ontology that specifies the functional association between resources. Accurate interpretation of resource need/supply also depends on the location of a message. We show how inference based on a domain model combined with location detection and interpretation in the social data can enhance situational awareness, e.g., predicting a medical emergency before it is reported as critical.",1-Jun-14

These hindering factors are primarily attributed to the top-down approach in designing computer networks that resulted in adopting a layered architecture for abstracting network functionalities as well as for engineering protocols; a methodology that proved to be neither adaptable nor evolvable in response to changes in network operational requirements and technological advancements. This paper presents a bottom-up strategy for designing computer networks through i) the formalization of network design core principles, ii) the derivation of a conceptual framework for network concerns and a structural model for network building elements inspired by natural complex systems, thus introducing the network cell which is the network elementary building block intrinsically capable of specialization, adaptation and evolution, and iii) finally, a cell-based network realization. Cell-based network adaptation capabilities are evaluated through simulations. Results show the awareness of HDP and TCP to path delays and the possibility of tweaking their operation accordingly.",1-Dec-09
5,Hoda Hassan,Towards a Framework for Evolvable Network Design,"The layered Internet architecture that had long guided network design and protocol engineering was an “interconnection architecture” defining a framework for interconnecting networks rather than a model for generic network structuring and engineering.

This paper reports on our work in progress that aims to: 1) Investigate the problem space in terms of the factors and decisions that influenced the design and development of computer networks; 2) Sketch the core principles for designing complex computer networks; and 3) Propose a model and related framework for building evolvable, adaptable and self organizing networks We will adopt a bottom up strategy primarily focusing on the building unit of the network model, which we call the “network cell”.

6,Hoda Hassan,Towards a Federated Network Architecture,"The layered architecture that guided the design of the Internet is deemed inadequate as a reference model for engineering protocols for NGN. Layered protocol suites impose a strict sequential order on protocol execution conflicting with the efficient engineering of end systems, as well as failing to express vertical functional integration, the separation of control and data planes, and the distributed nature of network functions. Furthermore, protocols developed according to the layered architecture are implemented as monolithic blocks with undefined or implicit dependencies lacking flexibility to adapt to changing application requirements. We claim that NGN architecture design should be dual faceted along a vertical and a horizontal dimension. The vertical dimension addresses complexity at a network node by abstracting the communication functionality into several components and defining component interactions, while the horizontal dimension addresses the distributed nature of the network, abstracting network links into communication paths, and defining procedures for creating, maintaining, as well as exchanging data between different network components along these paths. We propose a preliminary network architecture based on component federation.

7,Hoda Hassan,Securing the AODV Protocol Using Specification-Based Intrusion Detection,This paper presents an implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aiming to secure the AODV protocol designed for MANET. The IDS is designed as multiple static agents that run on a subset of the nodes in the network and executes a monitoring protocol that observes the process of route establishment. The monitoring protocol uses specification based intrusion detection to identify misuses to the routing messages. The IDS design is a correlation of previous work done in the field of MANET security. The IDS is implemented using ns-2 simulator and its ability to detect attacks was tested using previously devised attack scripts. Detailed specification for the runtime behavior of the AODV protocol was derived in the process of implementation,1-Oct-06

0,Massimiliano Albanese,Biometric multi-factor authentication: On the usability of the FingerPIN scheme,"Fingerprint-based authentication has been successfully adopted in a wide range of applications, including law enforcement and immigration, due to its numerous advantages over traditional password-based authentication. Despite the usability and accuracy of this technology, some significant concerns still exist, which can potentially hinder its further adoption. For instance, a fingerprint is permanently associated with an individual and, once stolen, cannot be replaced, thus compromising biometric-based authentication. To mitigate this concern, we previously designed a multi-factor authentication approach that integrates Type-1 and Type-3 authentication factors into a fingerprint-based personal identification number (PIN). To authenticate, a subject is required to present a sequence of fingerprints corresponding to the digits of the PIN, based on a predefined secret mapping between digits and fingers. We conducted a preliminary vulnerability analysis and demonstrated that this approach is robust to the compromise of one or more of the subject's fingerprints. The objective of the work presented in this paper is to identify any usability issues for this FingerPIN scheme, collect qualitative and quantitative data through a user study, and determine the participants' satisfaction with the authentication mechanism. We carried out systematic usability tests, designed suitable performance metrics for assessing authentication usability on an initial cohort of 100 individuals, and performed a comparative analysis of the FingerPIN scheme against traditional sequential multi-factor authentication schemes.",10-Nov-22
1,Massimiliano Albanese,Poster: Securing Distributed System Configuration through Optimization and Reasoning on Graphs,"Complex distributed systems are inherently difficult to secure due to the many interdependencies amongst their components, vulnerabilities, and configuration parameters. To address this problem, we present an approach for improving the security posture of distributed systems by examining the security impact of configuration changes across their interdependent components. We construct a graph-based model of the system and its vulnerabilities and use it to analyze the attack surface and the impact of attacks. We show how the model can be optimized using SMT solvers to derive configurations that minimize the impact of attacks while preserving system functionality.",24-Feb-19
2,Massimiliano Albanese,DeBot: A Novel Network-based Mechanism to Detect Exfiltration by Architectural Stealthy Botnets,"Malicious actors use networks of compromised and remotely controlled hosts, known as botnets, to execute different classes of cyberattacks, including exfiltration of sensitive data. Recently, we have observed a trend toward more resilient botnet architectures, departing from traditional centralized architectures and enabling botnets to evade detection and persist in a system indefinitely. Botnets can achieve resilience through architectural stealth, by establishing overlay networks that minimize exposure of malicious traffic to detectors. To address this problem, we propose a novel network‐based detection scheme, called DeBot, which identifies traffic flows associated with exfiltration attempts. The proposed solution intercepts traffic from different monitoring points and leverages differences in the network behavior of botnets and benign users to identify suspicious flows. To this aim, we first develop a mechanism to identify monitoring points that are likely to intercept a significant volume of malicious traffic. Then, we analyze flow characteristics to identify suspicious hosts and use periodogram analysis to identify malicious flows originating from those hosts. We evaluate the proposed approach against different botnets in the CyberVAN testbed and compare its performance against state‐of‐the‐art detection techniques. The results indicate that DeBot is effective in detecting botnet activity, thus enabling the identification and removal of bots.",5-Dec-18
3,Massimiliano Albanese,From Cyber Situational Awareness to Adaptive Cyber Defense: Leveling the Cyber Playing Field,"In the cyber security landscape, the asymmetric relationship between defender and attacker tends to favor the attacker: while the defender needs to protect a system against all possible ways of breaching it, the attacker needs to identify and exploit only one vulnerable entry point in order to succeed. In this chapter, we show how we can effectively reverse such intrinsic asymmetry in favor of the defender by concurrently pursuing two complementary objectives: increasing the defender’s understanding of multiple facets of the cyber landscape – referred to as Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) – and creating uncertainty for the attacker through Moving Target Defense (MTD) or Adaptive Cyber Defense (ACD) techniques. This chapter provides a brief overview of contributions in these areas, and discusses future research directions.",30-Nov-18
4,Massimiliano Albanese,A Quantitative Framework to Model Advanced Persistent Threats,"In recent years, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have emerged as increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, often waged by state actors or other hostile organizations against high-profile targets. APT actors employ a diversified set of sophisticated tools and advanced capabilities to penetrate target systems, evade detection, and maintain a foothold within compromised systems for extended periods of time. Stealth and persistence enable APT actors to conduct long-term espionage and sabotage operations. Despite significant efforts to develop APT detection and mitigation capabilities, the stealthy nature of APTs poses significant challenges, and defending from such threats is still an open research problem. In particular, quantitative models to capture how APTs may create and maintain a foothold within a target system are lacking. To address this gap, we propose a quantitative framework to (i) assess the cost incurred by APT actors to compromise and persist within a target system; (ii) estimate the value they gain over time by persisting in the system; (iii) simulate how the footprint of an APT evolves over time when, to maintain stealth, attackers have constraints on the volume of potentially detectable activity they can engage in. We also propose a preliminary defender model, and results from the evaluation show that our approach is promising, thus encouraging further research in this direction. ",26-Jul-18
5,Massimiliano Albanese,Defending from Stealthy Botnets Using Moving Target Defenses,"In today’s IT landscape, organizations are increasingly exposed to an array of novel and sophisticated threats—including advanced persistent threats (APTs) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks—which can bypass traditional defenses and persist in target systems indefinitely. Threat actors often rely on networks of compromised and remotely controlled hosts, known as botnets, to execute a number of different cyberattacks and engage in criminal or unauthorized activities. Protecting sensitive and mission-critical data from competitors, state actors, and organized crime has become increasingly critical for the well-being of many organizations. A promising approach to botnet detection and mitigation relies on moving target defense (MTD), a novel and game-changing approach to cyber defense. MTD creates asymmetric uncertainty, providing the defender with a tactical advantage over the attacker. MTD techniques are designed to continuously change or shift a system’s attack surface, thus increasing cost and complexity for the threat actors. We show how the botnet detection and mitigation problem can be decomposed in three related and relatively simpler challenges, and how these challenges can be effectively tackled adopting an MTD approach, ultimately limiting the ability of a botnet to persist within a target system.",6-Feb-18
6,Massimiliano Albanese,A Graphical Model to Assess the Impact of Multi-Step Attacks,"In the last several decades, networked systems have grown in complexity and sophistication, introducing complex interdependencies amongst their numerous and diverse components. Attackers can leverage such interdependencies to penetrate seemingly well-guarded networks through sophisticated multi-step attacks. Research has shown that explicit and implicit interdependencies exist at various layers of the hardware and software architecture. In particular, dependencies between vulnerabilities and dependencies between applications and services are critical for assessing the impact of multi-step attacks. These two classes of interdependencies have been traditionally studied using attack and dependency graphs respectively. Although significant work has been done in the area of both attack and dependency graphs, we demonstrate that neither of these models can provide an accurate assessment of an attack’s impact, when used in isolation. To address this limitation, we take a mission-centric approach and present a solution to integrate these two powerful models into a unified framework that enables us to accurately assess the impact of multi-step attacks and identify high-impact attack paths within a network. This analysis can ultimately generate effective hardening recommendations, and can be seen as one phase of a continuous process that iteratively cycles through impact analysis and vulnerability remediation stages.",1-Jan-18
7,Massimiliano Albanese,Performance Modeling of Moving Target Defenses,"In recent years, Moving Target Defense (MTD) has emerged as a potential game changer in the security landscape, due to its potential to create asymmetric uncertainty  that favors the defender. Many  different MTD techniques have then been proposed, each addressing an often very specific set of attack vectors. Despite the huge progress made in this area, there are still some critical gaps with respect to the analysis and quantification of the cost and benefits of deploying MTD techniques. In fact, common metrics to assess the performance of these techniques are still lacking and most of them tend to assess their performance in different and often incompatible ways. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a quantitative analytic model for assessing the resource availability and performance of MTDs, and a method for the determination of the highest possible reconfiguration rate, and thus smallest probability of attacker's success, that meets performance and stability constraints. Finally, we present an experimental validation of the proposed approach.",30-Oct-17

Despite the significant work done in this area and the many different techniques that have been proposed, MTD has not yet gained widespread adoption due to several limitations. Specifically, interactions between multiple techniques have not been studied yet and a unified framework for quantifying and comparing very diverse techniques is still lacking. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework to model how different MTD techniques can affect the information an attacker needs to exploit a system’s vulnerabilities, so as to introduce uncertainty and reduce the likelihood of successful attacks. We illustrate how this framework can be used to compare two sets of MTDs, and to select an optimal set of MTDs that maximize security within a given budget. Experimental results show that our approach is effective.",4-May-17
12,Massimiliano Albanese,From Idea to Prototype: Introducing Students to Entrepreneurship,"We describe results from a semester-long class taught by seven faculty at George Mason University, aimed at providing resources to engage students in idea generation, design cycle development, and finally elaboration of a business plan. This is intended to alleviate a perceived lack of access for students to commercialize their ideas. Undergraduate and graduate students are often left with unfinished class projects that do not turn into prototypes or products. Here we aim to avoid this outcome (often referred to as the “Valley of Death”). We recruited students with ideas for products as well as students with varied expertise. We have then formalized their engagement by offering a seminar class that met once every other week over a 15 week semester. After the class each team underwent a one-week intensive boot camp for a final demonstration and presentation of their product and business plan. Throughout the semester the teams solicited and received micro-grants, then used the financial support to acquire materials to prototype several iterations of their ideas. In this paper we present data from our preliminary analysis of two successful teams. Out of five teams who took the class, three completed, and two continued with their products beyond the class. We also discuss strategies to engage students, to form viable teams, to provide technical support, and to deliver content in a nontraditional environment, with students from different backgrounds (e.g., sociology, civil engineering, computer science) enrolled both in undergraduate and graduate programs.",11-Mar-17
13,Massimiliano Albanese,Moving Target Defense against DDoS Attacks: An Empirical Game-Theoretic Analysis,"Distributed denial-of-service attacks are an increasing problem facing web applications, for which many defense techniques have been proposed, including several moving-target strategies. These strategies typically work by relocating targeted services over time, increasing uncertainty for the attacker, while trying not to disrupt legitimate users or incur excessive costs. Prior work has not shown, however, whether and how a rational defender would choose a moving-target method against an adaptive attacker, and under what conditions. We formulate a denial-of-service scenario as a two-player game, and solve a restricted-strategy version of the game using the methods of empirical game-theoretic analysis. Using agent-based simulation, we evaluate the performance of strategies from prior literature under a variety of attacks and environmental conditions. We find evidence for the strategic stability of various proposed strategies, such as proactive server movement, delayed attack timing, and suspected insider blocking, along with guidelines for when each is likely to be most effective.",10-Oct-16
14,Massimiliano Albanese,A Moving Target Defense Approach to Disrupting Stealthy Botnets,"Botnets are increasingly being used for exfiltrating sensitive data from mission-critical systems. Research has shown that botnets have become extremely sophisticated and can operate in stealth mode by minimizing their host and network footprint. In order to defeat exfiltration by modern botnets,
we propose a moving target defense approach for dynamically deploying detectors across a network. Specifically, we propose several strategies based on centrality measures to periodically change the placement of detectors. Our objective is to increase the attacker's effort and likelihood of detection by creating uncertainty about the location of detectors and forcing botmasters to perform additional
actions in an attempt to create detector-free paths through the network. We present metrics to evaluate the proposed strategies and an algorithm to compute a lower bound on the detection probability. We validate our approach through simulations, and results conrm that the proposed solution effectively reduces the likelihood of successful exfiltration campaigns.",10-Oct-16

integration can be applied to the design of the next generation of safety devices for saving the life of children inadvertently left into parked vehicles. In the United States alone, an average 38 children die from heatstroke after being left into parked vehicles by their caregivers. To be effective, next-generation safety devices will need to have the capability of sensing the environment in and around the vehicle, integrating and processing data from an array of different sensors, assessing the risk in real time, and triggering appropriate corrective actions aimed
at removing or mitigating the risk factors for the child. ",14-Aug-14
16,Massimiliano Albanese,Automated Coding of Decision Support Variables,"With the enormous amount of textual information now available online, there is an increasing demand – especially in the national security community – for tools capable of automatically extracting certain types of information from massive amounts of raw data. In the last several years, ad-hoc Information Extraction (IE) systems have been developed to help address this need [6]. However, there are applications where the types of questions that need to be answered are far more complex than those that traditional IE systems can handle, and require to integrate information from several sources. For instance, political scientists need to monitor political organizations and conflicts, while defense and security analysts need to monitor terrorist groups. Typically, political scientists and analysts define a long list of variables – referred to as “codebook” – that they want to monitor over time for a number of groups. Currently, in most such efforts, the task of finding the right value for each variable – denoted as “coding” – is performed manually by human coders, and is extremely time consuming. Thus, the need for automation is enormous.

Injection of concentrated free chlorine stock solutions into wastewaters containing low levels of ammonia can promote NDMA formation because the high chlorine:ammonia ratio at the point of chlorine injection fosters dichloramine formation during mixing. This study combined chemical kinetic modeling, laboratory mixing studies using deionized water and authentic wastewater effluents, and a pilot-scale disinfectant contactor at a wastewater reuse facility to demonstrate that the distribution of the injection of concentrated hypochlorite stock solutions can reduce the level of NDMA formation by ≤50% compared to injection at a single location.

However, free chlorine exposures must be optimized to maximize pathogen inactivation while minimizing the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that are challenging to remove in the advanced treatment train. The results of this study indicate that sequential chlorination can be used to optimize the benefits of free chlorine (virus and NDMA control) and chloramine disinfection (THM, HAA, and coliform control).",31-May-18

0,Yang Shen,A novel sensitivity analysis of commercial building hybrid energy-structure performance,"AEC community is highly focused on designing buildings that can improve energy efficiency while maintaining adequate structural behavior (termed herein as energy-structure performance). To enhance the study of energy-structure performance, a novel framework of sensitivity analysis, including initial studies and global sensitivity analysis, was developed based on a general and automated platform of multi-physics simulation. This platform meets the requirements of object-orientation and provides compatibility with parametrical representation, including geometric/non-geometric parameters and detailed modeling. A systematic methodology of sensitivity analysis considering sensitivity auditing and a Scaled Morris Method is developed within the context of hybrid building energy-structure performance. The refined global screening sensitivity analysis (Scaled Morris Method) is proposed to deal with different types of data inputs and multiple-output sensitivity index comparison problems. A building case study was part of the research, which included two types of façades totaling 15 input factors. More than 2000 simulations were conducted producing the yearly/peak energy performance indicators over four climate zones along with static/dynamic structural performance indicators. The results from the initial studies and global sensitivity analysis provided varying/sensitivity effects of building topology/layout, structural/nonstructural components, and inherited features, which were compared quantitatively. For the curtain wall building, the absolute mean (sensitivity indices) input factors were up to 2.3 for energy indicators and 3.0 for structural indicators. The precast concrete panel wall building exhibited the absolute mean of input factors up to 2.8 for energy indicators and 2.4 for structural indicators. Overall, the results indicate this new framework, methodology, and sensitivity analysis can be used for commercial hybrid building energy-structure performance analysis.",5-Jun-21

0,Nathalia Peixoto,Dynamic steering of in vitro cortical neurons using field stimulation.,"Neurological disorders are often characterized by abnormal neuronal activity. In the case of epilepsy, this can manifest itself in the form of uncontrolled synchronous activity often in the form of bursting. Pattern steering is the ability to apply stimulation to a network that effectively changes its dynamical firing pattern. In an epileptic network, the stimulation would be used to move the seizing network from its abnormal state to a normal state. This idea is explored here in cultured networks of cortical neurons plated on microelectrode arrays. Stimulation was applied to the bath resulting in an electric field generated throughout the network. This field was verified as sub-threshold in strength using a finite element model simulation. Stimulated networks showed a significant suppression in the number of bursts and increase in the interburst interval as compared to control networks. This observed burst suppression suggests that the sub-threshold stimulating field moved networks from a state of high frequency bursting to a state of low frequency bursting.",9-Jan-15
1,Nathalia Peixoto,Voice controlled wheelchairs: Fine control by humming,"People without disabilities seamlessly control devices with their hands. Interestingly, their hands can perform coarse and fine control. Implementing smooth control for computerized systems is not straightforward and most of the time it is not intuitive either. Here we offer a solution to that problem: smooth control through humming. Voice commands have become ubiquitous in modern technology. Speech-to-text applications abound. Smooth control, on the other hand, has not been tackled yet. Here we design and implement a humming control technique, and demonstrate a hardware implementation with a powered wheelchair. Once actuated, the speed with which the chair moves will depend on the subtle variation on the fundamental frequency of the user's humming, acquired through an accelerometer measuring vocal cord vibration. We also discuss two signal processing techniques that handle commonly encountered issues when trying to resolve frequencies in real time data. The hardware implementation shows performance of 80% and higher in speech recognition for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 8 dB and 100% in smooth control and frequency detection for all tested SNRs. We also discuss potential applications of smooth humming control to other assistive technology.

In this paper, we present an improved contention-resolving MPC design. We propose a new branch cost formulation for the decision tree that is  constructed by contention-resolving MPC to handle the case where a vehicle is delayed multiple times before being allowed access to the intersection. All possible priority combinations are dynamically generated when constructing the decision tree. Based on the priority assignments, we design a decentralized control law to control vehicle speeds, which we show enjoys optimality properties under a specific priority assignment. We verify the effectiveness of our method through a simulation and a comparison with the First-Come-First-Serve scheduling strategy.",11-Dec-19
1,Ningshi Yao,Avoiding Chatter in an Online Co-Learning Algorithm Predicting Human Intention,"Chatter can happen when an online learning algorithm is used by a robot to predict human intention while interacting with a human subject. When chatter happens, the learning algorithm continually changes its prediction, without reaching  a constant prediction of human intention. Using the Rescorla-Wagner model for human learning, we analyze an expert based online learning algorithm and identify an invariant set in the state and parameter space where chatter will occur. Based on the chatter analysis, we also propose an improved expert based learning algorithm where the invariant set does not exist so that chatter can be avoided. ",11-Dec-19
2,Ningshi Yao,Autonomous flying blimp interaction with human in an indoor space,"We present the Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimp (GT-MAB), which is designed to support human-robot interaction experiments in an indoor space for up to two hours. GT-MAB is safe while flying in close proximity to humans. It is able to detect the face of a human subject, follow the human, and recognize hand gestures. GT-MAB employs a deep neural network based on the single shot multibox detector to jointly detect a human user’s face and hands in a real-time video stream collected by the onboard camera. A human-robot interaction procedure is designed and tested with various human users. The learning algorithms recognize two hand waving gestures. The human user does not need to wear any additional tracking device when interacting with the flying blimp. Vision-based feedback controllers are designed to control the blimp to follow the human and fly in one of two distinguishable patterns in response to each of the two hand gestures. The blimp communicates its intentions to the human user by displaying visual symbols. The collected experimental data show that the visual feedback from the blimp in reaction to the human user significantly improves the interactive experience between blimp and human. The demonstrated success of this procedure indicates that GT-MAB could serve as a flying robot that is able to collect human data safely in an indoor environment.",8-Jan-19

We formulate the intersection scheduling problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem which co-designs the priority and traveling speed for each vehicle. The co-design aims to minimize the vehicle waiting time at the intersection area, under a set of safety constraints. To solve the problem, we present a contention-resolving Model Predictive Control (MPC) method to dynamically assign priorities and compute the optimal speed for each vehicle based on the assigned priorities. The optimal priority assignment can be determined using a sampling based approach. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulation and shows reductions in traveling time.",21-Aug-18

We establish rigorous mathematical expressions for electric loads and battery banks in the micro-grid by considering their characteristics and constraints. Based on these mathematical models, we propose a novel real-time scheduling analysis method for priority-based energy management in micro-grid, named significant moments analysis (SMA). SMA pinpoints all the crucial moments when electrical operations are requested among the micro-grid and establishes a dynamic model to describe the scheduling behavior of electric loads. Using SMA, we can check the scheduling feasibility and predict whether the micro-grid can generate enough power to support the execution of electric loads. In the case where the power is insufficient to supply load demands, SMA can provide accurate information about the amount of insufficient power and the time when the insufficiency happens. Simulated results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed analysis method.",1-Sep-17
5,Ningshi Yao,Monocular vision-based human following on miniature robotic blimp,"We present an approach that allows the Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimp (GT-MAB) to detect and follow a human. This accomplishment is the first Human Robot Interaction (HRI) demonstration between an uninstrumented human and a robotic blimp. GT-MAB is an ideal platform for HRI missions because it is safe to humans and can support sufficient flight time for HRI experiments. However, due to complex aerodynamic influence on the blimp, the human following task for GT-MAB with a single on-board camera is a challenging problem. We integrate Haar face detector and KLT feature tracker to achieve robust human tracking. After a human face is detected in the real-time video stream, we estimated the 3D positions of the human with respect to GT-MAB. Visionbased PID controllers are designed based on estimated relative position and the motion primitives of GT-MAB such that it can achieve stable and continuous human following behavior. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the human following capability on GT-MAB.",29-May-17

Such scheduling strategies inevitably introduce time delays into controls. Considering the coupling between priority assignment and control, this paper proposes a novel method to co-design priority assignments and controls for each control loop in NCSs. The co-design aims to minimize the performance degradation caused by time delays. The priority assignment is determined by a path planning approach to search for optimal priority assignments. Model predictive controllers are designed based on optimizing priority assignments to compute optimal controls. Simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",24-May-17

This model allows us to mimic the effect of nanoparticles on the transmembrane potential, by decreasing the permeability of potassium ion channels. We show that our model agrees with the trends observed in our experiments. However, it also exhibits opposing trends under certain conditions, which were not seen in the experiments. This indicates that the membrane potential can be bistable. We analyze the cellular conditions which may cause this apparent bistability. The effects of adding nanoparticles on sodium and chloride ion channels are also studied using the proposed model. We hypothesize that nanoparticles may also block the sodium and chloride ion channels but the extent of blockage of these ion channels may differ from that of potassium ion channels.",6-Jul-16

We analyze the properties of the various models, prove that a performance measure based on a Risk Adjusted version of the Mean Gini Ratio (RAMGR) is coherent, and establish the equivalence between maximizing this performance measure and solving for the maximal Mean-Gini ratio. We propose a linearization approach for the fractional programming formulation of the MGR model. We also conduct a thorough evaluation of the various Mean-Gini models based on four data sets that represent combinations of bullish and bearish scenarios in the in-sample and out-of-sample phases. The performance is (i) analyzed with respect to eight return, risk, and risk-adjusted criteria, (ii) benchmarked with the S&P500 index, and (iii) compared with their Mean-Variance counterparts for varying risk aversion levels and with the Minimal CVaR and Minimal Semi-Deviation models. For the data sets used in our study, our results suggest that the various Mean-Gini models almost always result in solutions that outperform the S&P500 benchmark index with respect to the out-of-sample cumulative return. Further, particular instances of Mean-Gini models result in solutions that are as good or better (for example, MinG in bullish in-sample scenarios, and MGR in bearish out-of-sample scenarios) than the solutions obtained with their counterparts in Mean-Variance, Minimal CVaR and Minimal Semi-Deviation models.",Annals of Operations Research
1,Ran Ji,Risk-budgeting multi-portfolio optimization with portfolio and marginal risk constraints,"Multi-portfolio optimization problems and the incorporation of marginal risk contribution constraints have recently received a sustained interest from academia and financial practitioners. We propose a class of new stochastic risk budgeting multi-portfolio optimization models that impose portfolio as well as marginal risk constraints. The models permit the simultaneous and integrated optimization of multiple sub-portfolios in which the marginal risk contribution of each individual security is accounted for. A risk budget defined with a downside risk measure is allocated to each security. We consider the two cases in which the asset universes of the sub-portfolios are either disjoint (diversification of style) or overlap (diversification of judgment). The proposed models take the form of stochastic programming problems and include each a probabilistic constraint with multi-row random technology matrix. We expand a combinatorial modeling framework to represent the feasible set of the chance constraints first as a set of mixed-integer linear inequalities. The new reformulation proposed in this paper is much sparser than previously presented reformulations and allows the efficient solution of problem instances that could not be solved otherwise. We evaluate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed method that is general enough to be applied to general chance-constrained optimization problems. We conduct a cross-validation study via a rolling-horizon procedure to assess the performance of the models, and understand the impact of the parameters and diversification types on the portfolios.",Annals of Operations Research

1,Paulo Costa,Probabilistic Ontology and Knowledge Fusion for Procurement Fraud Detection in Brazil,"To cope with citizens’ demand for transparency and corruption prevention, the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General (CGU) has carried out a number of actions, including: awareness campaigns aimed at the private sector; campaigns to educate the public; research initiatives; and regular inspections and audits of municipalities and states. Although CGU has collected information from hundreds of different sources - Revenue Agency, Federal Police, and others - the process of fusing all this data has not been efficient enough to meet the needs of CGU’s decision makers. Therefore, it is natural to change the focus from data fusion to knowledge fusion. As a consequence, traditional syntactic methods should be augmented with techniques that represent and reason with the semantics of databases. However, commonly used approaches, such as Semantic Web technologies, fail to deal with uncertainty, a dominant characteristic in corruption prevention. This paper presents the use of probabilistic ontologies built with Probabilistic OWL (PR-OWL) to design and test a model that performs information fusion to detect possible frauds in procurements involving Federal money in Brazil. To design this model, a recently developed tool for creating PR-OWL ontologies was used with support from PR-OWL specialists and careful guidance from a fraud detection specialist from CGU. At present, the task of procurement fraud detection is done manually by an auditor. The number of suspicious cases that can be analyzed by a single person is small. The experimental results obtained with the presented approach are preliminary, but show the viability of developing a tool based on PR-OWL ontologies to automatize this task. This paper also examplifies how to use PR-OWL 2.0 to provide a link between the deterministic and probabilistic parts of the ontology.",1-Jan-13
2,Paulo Costa,Issues of uncertainty analysis in high-level information fusion,"High-Level Information Fusion (HLIF) utilizes techniques from Low-Level Information Fusion (LLIF) to support situation/impact assessment, user involvement, and mission and resource management (SUM). Given the unbounded analysis of situations, events, users, resources, and missions; it is obvious that uncertainty is manifested by the nature of application requirements. In this panel, we seek discussions on methods and techniques to intelligently assess the problem of HLIF uncertainty analysis to alleviate high-performance statistical computational optimizations, unrealizable mathematical assumptions, or rigorous modeling and problem scoping which lead to time delays, brittleness, and rigidity, respectively. Given the various methods of LLIF and the complexity of HLIF, an interest to the ISIF community is to utilize diverse methods (such as those from other communities) that bridge the LLIF-HLIF gap of uncertainty analysis. To get a qualified and diverse viewpoint, we present a summary of HLIF uncertainty processes towards developing a multisource ontology of uncertainty to support HLIF modeling, methods, and management and systems design.",12-Jul-12

Both involve various types of uncertainty and require a sound automated inferential process. Probabilistic ontologies support uncertainty management in semantically aware systems, and facilitate modular, interoperable systems. This paper describes the process of developing a probabilistic ontology for a Maritime Domain Awareness application. The ontology was created to support identification of ships behaving suspiciously enough to be declared ships of interest. The original model was expanded in two ways: to provide reasons for declaring a ship as being of interest, and to include individual crew member associations. The latter is achieved by supporting inferences about a person's close relations, group associations, communications, and background influences to assess his likelihood of having terrorist links.",5-Jul-11

6,Paulo Costa,Evaluating uncertainty representation and reasoning in HLF systems,"High-level fusion of hard and soft information from diverse sensor types still depends heavily on human cognition. This results in a scalability conundrum that current technologies are incapable of solving. Although there is widespread acknowledgement that an HLF framework must support automated knowledge representation and reasoning with uncertainty, there is no consensus on the most appropriate technology to satisfy this requirement. Further, the debate among proponents of the various approaches is laden with miscommunication and ill-supported assumptions, which inhibits advancement of HLF research as a whole. A clearly defined, scientifically rigorous evaluation framework is needed to help information fusion researchers assess the suitability of various approaches and tools to their applications. This paper describes requirements for such a framework and describes a use case in HLF evaluation.",1-Jan-11

achieved as yet, primarily due to several key issues not fully addressed in the original work. This paper describes several important issues of compatibility between PR-OWL and OWL, and suggests approaches to deal with them. To illustrate the issues and how they can be addressed, we use procurement fraud as an example application domain [2]. First, we describe the lack of mapping between PR-OWL random variables (RVs)
and the concepts defined in OWL, and then show how this mapping can be done. Second, we describe PR-OWL's lack of compatibility with existing types already present in OWL, and then show how every type defined in PR-OWL can be directly mapped to concepts already present in OWL.",1-Jul-10

This paper argues that just as the problem space demands interoperability of diverse technologies, so must the solution space. In other words, not only are new approaches needed, but they must also come together as a seamlessly interoperable technological tool set. This can be accomplished only via a consistent multidisciplinary approach. 
In this paper, we present some of the major requirements of today’s Predictive Situation Awareness Systems (PSAW), propose our approach as a coordinated mix between state-of-the-art research efforts, and present the architecture for enabling our approach.",1-Jan-10

Continuous advances in microscopic imaging and tracing software have provided an increasingly abundant availability of 3D reconstructions of arborizing dendrites, axons, and processes, allowing their detailed study. However, efficient, large-scale methods to rank neural morphologies by similarity to an archetype are still lacking. Using the NeuroMorpho.Org database, we present a similarity search software enabling fast morphological comparison of hundreds of thousands of neural reconstructions from any species, brain regions, cell types, and preparation protocols. We compared the performance of different morphological measurements: 1) summary morphometrics calculated by L-Measure, 2) persistence vectors, a vectorized descriptor of branching structure, 3) the combination of the two. In all cases, we also investigated the impact of applying dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). We assessed qualitative performance by gauging the ability to rank neurons in order of visual similarity. Moreover, we quantified information content by examining explained variance and benchmarked the ability to identify occasional duplicate reconstructions of the same specimen. We also compared two different methods for selecting the number of principal components using this benchmark. The results indicate that combining summary morphometrics and persistence vectors with applied PCA using maximum likelihood based automatic dimensionality selection provides an information rich characterization that enables efficient and precise comparison of neural morphology. We have deployed the similarity search as open-source online software both through a user-friendly graphical interface and as an API for programmatic access.",14-May-22
1,Bengt Ljungquist,Efficient metadata mining of web-accessible neural morphologies,"Advancements in neuroscience research have led to steadily accelerating data production and sharing. The online community repository of neural reconstructions NeuroMorpho.Org grew from fewer than 1000 digitally traced neurons in 2006 to more than 140,000 cells today, including glia that now constitute 10.1% of the content. Every reconstruction consists of a detailed 3D representation of branch geometry and connectivity in a standardized format, from which a collection of morphometric features is extracted and stored. Moreover, each entry in the database is accompanied by rich metadata annotation describing the animal subject, anatomy, and experimental details. The rapid expansion of this resource in the past decade was accompanied by a parallel rise in the complexity of the available information, creating both opportunities and challenges for knowledge mining. Here, we introduce a new summary reporting functionality, allowing NeuroMorpho.Org users to efficiently download digests of metadata and morphometrics from multiple groups of similar cells for further analysis. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tool for both glia and neurons and present an illustrative statistical analysis of the resulting data.",19-May-21

Extrapolating these developments we here set out to construct a scalable software architecture that would enable near-future massive parallel recording, organization and analysis of neurophysiological data on a standard computer. To this end we combined, for the first time in the present context, bit-encoding of spike data with a specific communication format for real time transfer and storage of neuronal data, synchronized by a common time base across all unit sources. We demonstrate that our architecture can simultaneously handle data from more than one million neurons and provide, in real time (< 25 ms), feedback based on analysis of previously recorded data. In addition to managing recordings from very large numbers of neurons in real time, it also has the capacity to handle the extensive periods of recording time necessary in certain scientific and clinical applications. Furthermore, the bit-encoding proposed has the additional advantage of allowing an extremely fast analysis of spatiotemporal spike patterns in a large number of neurons. Thus, we conclude that this architecture is well suited to support current and near-future Brain Machine Interface requirements.",5-Mar-18

6,Bengt Ljungquist,A distributed light-weight database for the organization of electrophysiological data.,"When sharing neural data, both electrophysiological and image data as well as other forms of data, there are some requirements which should be met: 1) Different acquisitions system have different data formats for offline and real time data, which needs to be accessed and processed in a common way by applications; 2) Data need to be stored in a database system directly in connection with the recording facility in order to facilitate data organization and sharing; 3) Data must be accessible for data-intensive applications. In this work, we present a distributed database system which allows for storing and analysis of electrophysiological data in real time simultaneously across multiple locations, addressing the problems identified above. The database is light-weight as it stores only the electrophysiological data itself, and may be complemented by databases of meta data, whose format is more likely to change from experiment to experiment and may not be easily standardized across labs. We also present a case study which shows how data both from simulations and experiments, the latter taken form multiple types of acquisition systems, can reside in the same data base and be shared in real time, thus allowing for direct and parallel computational analysis of electrophysiological data.",1-Jan-12

8,Bengt Ljungquist,Spike feature stability during long-term recordings.,"Non-stationary variations in the shape and amplitude of extracellularly recorded neuronal action potentials may cause serious problems in analysis of neuronal responses over time. Such non-stationarity may be caused by many different mechanisms such as: dislocation of electrodes in tissue, tissue responses like microglial invasion or proliferation of astrocytes displacing neurons from the electrodes or by neuronal properties changing over time as a result of plasticity or changing states of the neuronal network. Even if a successful spike sorting is performed, it may therefore be difficult to judge if the identified units are produced by the same or by different neurons during discontinuous recording sessions. Thus, by for example analyzing the unit distribution in the principal component space, the same neuron may be smeared out in this feature space.
In this work, we have developed software that utilizes a subset of features that is stable over time for tracking single units during discontinuous recordings from cortical or striatal neurons. We have also implemented classification software using these features, which allows automatic tracking of neurons.
In conclusion, our new “neuron tracking” software is likely to prove useful in studies of long term changes in neuronal responses during for instance learning. It may also provide a valuable tool by which different electrode designs can be tested.",1-Jan-10

Although estimates exist for the total neuronal populations in different species, the number and definition of each specific neuron type are still intensively investigated. Hippocampome.org is an open-source knowledge base with morphological, physiological and molecular information for 122 neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation. While such framework identifies all known neuron types in this system, their relative abundances remain largely unknown. This work quantitatively estimates the counts of all Hippocampome.org neuron types by literature mining and numerical optimization. We report the number of neurons in each type identified by main neurotransmitter (glutamate or GABA) and axonal-dendritic patterns throughout 26 subregions and layers of the dentate gyrus, Ammon's horn, subiculum and entorhinal cortex. We produce by sensitivity analysis reliable numerical ranges for each type and summarize the amounts across broad neuronal families defined by biomarkers expression and firing dynamics.

2,Diek Wheeler,A Method for Estimating the Potential Synaptic Connections Between Axons and Dendrites From 2D Neuronal Images,"Computational neuroscience aims to model, reproduce, and predict network dynamics for different neuronal ensembles by distilling knowledge derived from electrophysiological and morphological evidence. However, analyses and simulations often remain critically limited by the sparsity of direct experimental constraints on essential parameters, such as electron microscopy and electrophysiology pair/multiple recording evidence of connectivity statistics. Notably, available data are particularly scarce regarding quantitative information on synaptic connections among identified neuronal types. Here, we present a user-friendly data-driven pipeline to estimate connection probabilities, number of contacts per connected pair, and distances from the pre- and postsynaptic somas along the axonal and dendritic paths from commonly available two-dimensional tracings and other broadly accessible measurements. The described procedure does not require any computational background and is accessible to all neuroscientists. This protocol therefore fills the important gap from neuronal morphology to circuit organization and can be applied to many different neural systems, brain regions, animal species, and data sources.

3,Diek Wheeler,An update to Hippocampome.org by integrating single-cell phenotypes with circuit function in vivo,"Understanding brain operation demands linking basic behavioral traits to cell-type specific dynamics of different brain-wide subcircuits. This requires a system to classify the basic operational modes of neurons and circuits. Single-cell phenotyping of firing behavior during ongoing oscillations in vivo has provided a large body of evidence on entorhinal–hippocampal function, but data are dispersed and diverse. Here, we mined literature to search for information regarding the phase-timing dynamics of over 100 hippocampal/entorhinal neuron types defined in Hippocampome.org. We identified missing and unresolved pieces of knowledge (e.g., the preferred theta phase for a specific neuron type) and complemented the dataset with our own new data. By confronting the effect of brain state and recording methods, we highlight the equivalences and differences across conditions and offer a number of novel observations. We show how a heuristic approach based on oscillatory features of morphologically identified neurons can aid in classifying extracellular recordings of single cells and discuss future opportunities and challenges towards integrating single-cell phenotypes with circuit function.",6-May-21
4,Diek Wheeler,Comprehensive estimates of potential synaptic connections in local circuits of the rodent hippocampal formation by axonal-dendritic overlap,"A quantitative description of the hippocampal formation synaptic architecture is essential for understanding the neural mechanisms of episodic memory. Yet the existing knowledge of connectivity statistics between different neuron types in the rodent hippocampus only captures a mere 5% of this circuitry. We present a systematic pipeline to produce first-approximation estimates for most of the missing information. Leveraging the www.Hippocampome.org knowledge base, we derive local connection parameters between distinct pairs of morphologically identified neuron types based on their axonal-dendritic overlap within every layer and subregion of the hippocampal formation. Specifically, we adapt modern image analysis technology to determine the parcel-specific neurite lengths of every neuron type from representative morphologic reconstructions obtained from either sex. We then compute the average number of synapses per neuron pair using relevant anatomic volumes from the mouse brain atlas and ultrastructurally established interaction distances. Hence, we estimate connection probabilities and number of contacts for >1900 neuron type pairs, increasing the available quantitative assessments more than 11-fold. Connectivity statistics thus remain unknown for only a minority of potential synapses in the hippocampal formation, including those involving long-range (23%) or perisomatic (6%) connections and neuron types without morphologic tracings (7%). The described approach also yields approximate measurements of synaptic distances from the soma along the dendritic and axonal paths, which may affect signal attenuation and delay. Overall, this dataset fills a substantial gap in quantitatively describing hippocampal circuits and provides useful model specifications for biologically realistic neural network simulations, until further direct experimental data become available.",24-Feb-21
5,Diek Wheeler,Molecular expression profiles of morphologically defined hippocampal neuron types: Empirical evidence and relational inferences,"Gene and protein expressions are key determinants of cellular function. Neurons are the building blocks of brain circuits, yet the relationship between their molecular identity and the spatial distribution of their dendritic inputs and axonal outputs remains incompletely understood. The open-source knowledge base Hippocampome.org amasses such transcriptomic data from the scientific literature for morphologically defined neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation: dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Positive, negative, or mixed expression reports were initially obtained from published articles directly connecting molecular evidence to neurons with known axonal and dendritic patterns across hippocampal layers. Here, we supplement this information by collating, formalizing, and leveraging relational expression inferences that link a gene or protein expression or lack thereof to that of another molecule or to an anatomical location. With these additional interpretations, we freely release online a comprehensive human- and machine-readable molecular profile for more than 100 neuron types in Hippocampome.org. Analysis of these data ascertains the ability to distinguish unequivocally most neuron types in each of the major subdivisions of the hippocampus based on currently known biochemical markers. Moreover, grouping neuron types by expression similarity reveals eight superfamilies characterized by a few defining molecules.",1-May-20
6,Diek Wheeler,Quantitative firing pattern phenotyping of hippocampal neuron types,"Systematically organizing the anatomical, molecular, and physiological properties of cortical neurons is important for understanding their computational functions. Hippocampome.org defines 122 neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation based on their somatic, axonal, and dendritic locations, putative excitatory/inhibitory outputs, molecular marker expression, and biophysical properties. We augmented the electrophysiological data of this knowledge base by collecting, quantifying, and analyzing the firing responses to depolarizing current injections for every hippocampal neuron type from published experiments. We designed and implemented objective protocols to classify firing patterns based on 5 transients (delay, adapting spiking, rapidly adapting spiking, transient stuttering, and transient slow-wave bursting) and 4 steady states (non-adapting spiking, persistent stuttering, persistent slow-wave bursting, and silence). This automated approach revealed 9 unique (plus one spurious) families of firing pattern phenotypes while distinguishing potential new neuronal subtypes. Novel statistical associations emerged between firing responses and other electrophysiological properties, morphological features, and molecular marker expression. The firing pattern parameters, experimental conditions, spike times, references to the original empirical evidences, and analysis scripts are released open-source through Hippocampome.org for all neuron types, greatly enhancing the existing search and browse capabilities. This information, collated online in human- and machine-accessible form, will help design and interpret both experiments and model simulations.",29-Nov-19
7,Diek Wheeler,Simple models of quantitative firing phenotypes in hippocampal neurons: Comprehensive coverage of intrinsic diversity,"Patterns of periodic voltage spikes elicited by a neuron help define its dynamical identity. Experimentally recorded spike trains from various neurons show qualitatively distinguishable features such as delayed spiking, spiking with or without frequency adaptation, and intrinsic bursting. Moreover, the input-dependent responses of a neuron not only show different quantitative features, such as higher spike frequency for a stronger input current injection, but can also exhibit qualitatively different responses, such as spiking and bursting under different input conditions, thus forming a complex phenotype of responses. In previous work, the comprehensive knowledge base of hippocampal neuron types Hippocampome.org systematically characterized various spike pattern phenotypes experimentally identified from 120 neuron types/subtypes. In this paper, we present a complete set of simple phenomenological models that quantitatively reproduce the diverse and complex phenotypes of hippocampal neurons. In addition to point-neuron models, we created compact multi-compartment models with up to four compartments, which will allow spatial segregation of synaptic integration in network simulations. Electrotonic compartmentalization observed in our compact multi-compartment models is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. The models were created using an automated pipeline based on evolutionary algorithms. This work maps 120 neuron types/subtypes in the rodent hippocampus to a low-dimensional model space and adds another dimension to the knowledge accumulated in Hippocampome.org. Computationally efficient representations of intrinsic dynamics, along with other pieces of knowledge available in Hippocampome.org, provide a biologically realistic platform to explore the large-scale interactions of various neuron types at the mesoscopic level.",28-Oct-19
8,Diek Wheeler,Molecular fingerprinting of principal neurons in the rodent hippocampus: A neuroinformatics approach,"Neurons are often classified by their morphological and molecular properties. The online knowledge base Hippocampome.org primarily defines neuron types from the rodent hippocampal formation based on their main neurotransmitter (glutamate or GABA) and the spatial distributions of their axons and dendrites. For each neuron type, this open-access resource reports any and all published information regarding the presence or absence of known molecular markers, including calcium-binding proteins, neuropeptides, receptors, channels, transcription factors, and other molecules of biomedical relevance. The resulting chemical profile is relatively sparse: even for the best studied neuron types, the expression or lack thereof of fewer than 70 molecules has been firmly established to date. The mouse genome-wide in situ hybridization mapping of the Allen Brain Atlas provides a wealth of data that, when appropriately analyzed, can substantially augment the molecular marker knowledge in Hippocampome.org. Here we focus on the principal cell layers of dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, CA2, and CA1, which together contain approximately 90% of hippocampal neurons. These four anatomical parcels are densely packed with somata of mostly excitatory projection neurons. Thus, gene expression data for those layers can be justifiably linked to the respective principal neuron types: granule cells in DG and pyramidal cells in CA3, CA2, and CA1. In order to enable consistent interpretation across genes and regions, we screened the whole-genome dataset against known molecular markers of those neuron types. The resulting threshold values allow over 6000 very-high confidence (>99.5%) expressed/not-expressed assignments, expanding the biochemical information content of Hippocampome.org more than five-fold. Many of these newly identified molecular markers are potential pharmacological targets for major neurological and psychiatric conditions. Furthermore, our approach yields reasonable expression/non-express...",10-Sep-17
9,Diek Wheeler,Name-calling in the hippocampus (and beyond): coming to terms with neuron types and properties,"Widely spread naming inconsistencies in neuroscience pose a vexing obstacle to effective communication within and across areas of expertise. This problem is particularly acute when identifying neuron types and their properties. Hippocampome.org is a web-accessible neuroinformatics resource that organizes existing data about essential properties of all known neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation. Hippocampome.org links evidence supporting the assignment of a property to a type with direct pointers to quotes and figures. Mining this knowledge from peer-reviewed reports reveals the troubling extent of terminological ambiguity and undefined terms. Examples span simple cases of using multiple synonyms and acronyms for the same molecular biomarkers (or other property) to more complex cases of neuronal naming. New publications often use different terms without mapping them to previous terms. As a result, neurons of the same type are assigned disparate names, while neurons of different types are bestowed the same name. Furthermore, non-unique properties are frequently used as names, and several neuron types are not named at all. In order to alleviate this nomenclature confusion regarding hippocampal neuron types and properties, we introduce a new functionality of Hippocampome.org: a fully searchable, curated catalog of human and machine-readable definitions, each linked to the corresponding neuron and property terms. Furthermore, we extend our robust approach to providing each neuron type with an informative name and unique identifier by mapping all encountered synonyms and homonyms.",1-Mar-17
10,Diek Wheeler,Graph theoretic and motif analyses of the hippocampal neuron type potential connectome,"We computed the potential connectivity map of all known neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation by supplementing scantly available synaptic data with spatial distributions of axons and dendrites from the open-access knowledge base Hippocampome.org. The network that results from this endeavor, the broadest and most complete for a mammalian cortical region at the neuron-type level to date, contains more than 3200 connections among 122 neuron types across six subregions. Analyses of these data using graph theory metrics unveil the fundamental architectural principles of the hippocampal circuit. Globally, we identify a highly specialized topology minimizing communication cost; a modular structure underscoring the prominence of the trisynaptic loop; a core set of neuron types serving as information-processing hubs as well as a distinct group of particular antihub neurons; a nested, two-tier rich club managing much of the network traffic; and an innate resilience to random perturbations. At the local level, we uncover the basic building blocks, or connectivity patterns, that combine to produce complex global functionality, and we benchmark their utilization in the circuit relative to random networks. Taken together, these results provide a comprehensive connectivity profile of the hippocampus, yielding novel insights on its functional operations at the computationally crucial level of neuron types.",1-Nov-16
11,Diek Wheeler,In search of a periodic table of the neurons: Axonal-dendritic circuitry as the organizing principle: Patterns of axons and dendrites within distinct anatomical parcels provide the blueprint for circuit-based neuronal classification,"No one knows yet how to organize, in a simple yet predictive form, the knowledge concerning the anatomical, biophysical, and molecular properties of neurons that are accumulating in thousands of publications every year. The situation is not dissimilar to the state of Chemistry prior to Mendeleev's tabulation of the elements. We propose that the patterns of presence or absence of axons and dendrites within known anatomical parcels may serve as the key principle to define neuron types. Just as the positions of the elements in the periodic table indicate their potential to combine into molecules, axonal and dendritic distributions provide the blueprint for network connectivity. Furthermore, among the features commonly employed to describe neurons, morphology is considerably robust to experimental conditions. At the same time, this core classification scheme is suitable for aggregating biochemical, physiological, and synaptic information.",1-Oct-16
12,Diek Wheeler,Hippocampome.org: a knowledge base of neuron types in the rodent hippocampus,"The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped region of the brain that is responsible for learning, emotions, and memory. Like other regions of the brain, it contains many types of neurons that send information to each other by releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters across junctions known as synapses. Identifying all the different neuron types in the hippocampus is an important step towards understanding in detail how this brain region works.

Thousands of articles have been published that attempt to characterize the neurons in the hippocampus, but many of these studies report only some of the properties of a new neuron type. It is also often difficult to compare the results of different studies, as many different approaches have been used to investigate neuron types, and different studies often use different terms to describe similar features.

Wheeler et al. have now created a resource called Hippocampome.org that combines approximately 14,000 pieces of experimental evidence about neuron types in the rat hippocampus into a unified database. Analyzing these data has revealed about 3700 different neuron properties. By primarily considering the pattern formed by the branched axons and dendrites, the outputs and inputs that extend out of a neuron, Wheeler et al. have identified over a hundred different neuron types. This classification system also considers how selectively the neuron forms synapses with other cells and the identity of the neurotransmitter released by the neuron. In the future, other features of the neurons will also be incorporated into the system to help refine the classifications.

All of this information is online and freely available at Hippocampome.org. This resource is expected to provide a solid basis for analyzing how the hippocampus works, by helping researchers to design and interpret experiments and simulations. ",24-Sep-15
13,Diek Wheeler,Bivariate and multivariate NeuroXidence: a robust and reliable method to detect modulations of spike–spike synchronization across experimental conditions,"Synchronous neuronal firing has been proposed as a potential neuronal code. To determine whether synchronous firing is really involved in different forms of information processing, one needs to directly compare the amount of synchronous firing due to various factors, such as different experimental or behavioral conditions. In order to address this issue, we present an extended version of the previously published method, NeuroXidence. The improved method incorporates bi- and multivariate testing to determine whether different factors result in synchronous firing occurring above the chance level. We demonstrate through the use of simulated data sets that bi- and multivariate NeuroXidence reliably and robustly detects joint-spike-events across different factors.",19-Aug-11
14,Diek Wheeler,NeuroXidence: reliable and efficient analysis of an excess or deficiency of joint-spike events,"We present a non-parametric and computationally efficient method named NeuroXidence that detects coordinated firing of two or more neurons and tests whether the observed level of coordinated firing is significantly different from that expected by chance. The method considers the full auto-structure of the data, including the changes in the rate responses and the history dependencies in the spiking activity. Also, the method accounts for trial-by-trial variability in the dataset, such as the variability of the rate responses and their latencies. NeuroXidence can be applied to short data windows lasting only tens of milliseconds, which enables the tracking of transient neuronal states correlated to information processing. We demonstrate, on both simulated data and single-unit activity recorded in cat visual cortex, that NeuroXidence discriminates reliably between significant and spurious events that occur by chance.",1-Aug-08
15,Diek Wheeler,Behavioral performance modulates spike field coherence in monkey prefrontal cortex,"To investigate neuronal processing during short-term memory, we analyzed behavior-related modulations of coupling between signals on two spatial scales: first, very local multiunit activity and second, local field potentials. Coupling was assessed by spike field coherence using a new approach to overcome limitations in cases of low firing rates. We demonstrate the reliability of our approach with simulated data. Application to recordings in prefrontal cortex of two monkeys revealed that locking of spikes was differentially modulated with two different frequency bands depending on behavioral performance.",22-Jan-08
16,Diek Wheeler,Brightness induction: rate enhancement and neuronal synchronization as complementary codes,"In cat visual cortex, we investigated with parallel recordings from multiple units the neuronal correlates of perceived brightness. The perceived brightness of a center grating was changed by varying the orientation or the relative spatial phase of a surrounding grating. Brightness enhancement by orientation contrast is associated with an increase of discharge rates of responses to the center grating but not with changes in spike synchronization. In contrast, if brightness enhancement is induced by phase offset, discharge rates are unchanged but synchronization increases between neurons responding to the center grating. The changes in synchronization correlate well with changes in perceived brightness that were assessed in parallel in human subjects using the same stimuli. These results indicate that in cerebral cortex the modulation of synchronicity of responses is used as a mechanism complementary to rate changes to enhance the saliency of neuronal responses.",21-Dec-06

Our simulation studies show how relatively small, recurrent microcircuits can interact with populations of neurons, achieving spontaneous memory/recall effects. Here, context modulation can play an important part in the conditioned recall. The emphasis is on the dynamical self-sustained activity of the recurrent microcircuit viewed as a"" mental state"" which can be interpreted by a target output population and controlled by external waves of activity (mainly external inhibitory waves). We also consider the problem of selforganization and dynamical interaction between neuronal populations, which could have a key role in inference, memory and behavior.",1-May-05
18,Diek Wheeler,Estimating use-dependent synaptic gain in autonomic ganglia by computational simulation and dynamic-clamp analysis,"Biological gain mechanisms regulate the sensitivity and dynamics of signaling pathways at the systemic, cellular, and molecular levels. In the sympathetic nervous system, gain in sensory-motor feedback loops is essential for homeostatic regulation of blood pressure and body temperature. This study shows how synaptic convergence and plasticity can interact to generate synaptic gain in autonomic ganglia and thereby enhance homeostatic control. Using a conductance-based computational model of an idealized sympathetic neuron, we simulated the postganglionic response to noisy patterns of presynaptic activity and found that a threefold amplification in postsynaptic spike output can arise in ganglia, depending on the number and strength of nicotinic synapses, the presynaptic firing rate, the extent of presynaptic facilitation, and the expression of muscarinic and peptidergic excitation. The simulations also showed that postsynaptic refractory periods serve to limit synaptic gain and alter postsynaptic spike timing. Synaptic gain was measured by stimulating dissociated bullfrog sympathetic neurons with 1–10 virtual synapses using a dynamic clamp. As in simulations, the threshold synaptic conductance for nicotinic excitation of firing was typically 10–15 nS, and synaptic gain increased with higher levels of nicotinic convergence. Unlike the model, gain in neurons sometimes declined during stimulation. This postsynaptic effect was partially blocked by 10 μM Cd2+, which inhibits voltage-dependent calcium currents. These results support a general model in which the circuit variations observed in parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglia, as well as other neural relays, can enable functional subsets of neurons to behave either as 1:1 relays, variable amplifiers, or switches.",1-Nov-04
19,Diek Wheeler,Implementation of a fast 16-bit dynamic clamp using LabVIEW-RT,"The dynamic-clamp method provides a powerful electrophysiological tool for creating virtual ionic conductances in living cells and studying their influence on membrane potential. Here we describe G-clamp, a new way to implement a dynamic clamp using the real-time version of the Lab-VIEW programming environment together with a Windows host, an embedded microprocessor that runs a real-time operating system and a multifunction data-acquisition board. The software includes descriptions of a fast voltage-dependent sodium conductance, delayed rectifier, M-type and A-type potassium conductances, and a leak conductance. The system can also read synaptic conductance waveforms from preassembled data files. These virtual conductances can be reliably implemented at speeds ≤43 kHz while simultaneously saving two channels of data with 16-bit precision. G-clamp also includes utilities for measuring current-voltage relations, synaptic strength, and synaptic gain. Taking an approach built on a commercially available software/hardware platform has resulted in a system that is easy to assemble and upgrade. In addition, the graphical programming structure of LabVIEW should make it relatively easy for others to adapt G-clamp for new experimental applications.",1-Jan-04

0,Parag Chitnis,Correlation of rupture dynamics to the nonlinear backscatter response from polymer-shelled ultrasound contrast agents," Polymer-shelled ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) may expel their encapsulated gas subject to ultrasound- induced shell buckling or rupture. Nonlinear oscillations of this gas bubble can produce a subharmonic component in the ultrasound backscatter. This study investigated the relationship between this gas-release mechanism and shell-thickness??? to???radius ratios (STRRs) of polymer-shelled UCAs. Three types of polylactide-shelled UCAs with STRRs of 7.5, 40, and 100 nm/??m were studied. Each UCA population had a nominal mean diameter of 2 ??m. UCAs were subjected to increasing static overpressure ranging from 2 to 330 kPa over a duration of 2 h in a custom-designed test chamber while being imaged using a 200?? magnification video microscope at a frame rate of 5 frames/s. Digitized video images were binarized and processed to obtain the cross-sectional area of individual UCAs. Integration of the normalized cross-sectional area over normalized time, defined as buckling factor (Bf), provided a dimensionless parameter for quantifying and comparing the degree of pre-rupture buckling exhibited by the UCAs of different STRRs in response to overpressure. The UCAs with an STRR of 7.5 nm/??m exhibited a distinct shell-buckling phase before shell rupture (Bf < 1), whereas the UCAs with higher STRRs (40 and 100 nm/??m) did not undergo significant prerupture buckling (Bf ??? 1). The difference in the overpressure response was correlated with the subharmonic response produced by these UCAs. When excited using 20-MHz ultrasound, individual UCAs (N = 3000) in populations that did not exhibit a buckling phase produced a subharmonic response that was an order of magnitude greater than the UCA population with a prominent pre-rupture buckling phase. These results indicate the mechanism of gas expulsion from these UCAs might be a relevant factor in determining the level of subharmonic response in response to high-frequency ultrasound ",1-Mar-15

0,Shani Ross,Chronic monitoring of lower urinary tract activity via a sacral dorsal root ganglia interface,"Objective. Our goal is to develop an interface that integrates chronic monitoring of lower urinary tract (LUT) activity with stimulation of peripheral pathways. Approach. Penetrating microelectrodes were implanted in sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of adult male felines. Peripheral electrodes were placed on or in the pudendal nerve, bladder neck and near the external urethral sphincter. Supra-pubic bladder catheters were implanted for saline infusion and pressure monitoring. Electrode and catheter leads were enclosed in an external housing on the back. Neural signals from microelectrodes and bladder pressure of sedated or awake-behaving felines were recorded under various test conditions in weekly sessions. Electrodes were also stimulated to drive activity. Main results. LUT single- and multi-unit activity was recorded for 4–11 weeks in four felines. As many as 18 unique bladder pressure single-units were identified in each experiment. Some channels consistently recorded bladder afferent activity for up to 41 d, and we tracked individual single-units for up to 23 d continuously. Distension-evoked and stimulation-driven (DRG and pudendal) bladder emptying was observed, during which LUT sensory activity was recorded. Significance. This chronic implant animal model allows for behavioral studies of LUT neurophysiology and will allow for continued development of a closed-loop neuroprosthesis for bladder control.",4-May-17
1,Shani Ross,Hysteretic behavior of bladder afferent neurons in response to changes in bladder pressure,"Background
Mechanosensitive afferents innervating the bladder increase their firing rate as the bladder fills and pressure rises. However, the relationship between afferent firing rates and intravesical pressure is not a simple linear one. Firing rate responses to pressure can differ depending on prior activity, demonstrating hysteresis in the system. Though this hysteresis has been commented on in published literature, it has not been quantified.

Results
Sixty-six bladder afferents recorded from sacral dorsal root ganglia in five alpha-chloralose anesthetized felines were identified based on their characteristic responses to pressure (correlation coefficient ≥ 0.2) during saline infusion (2 ml/min). For saline infusion trials, we calculated a maximum hysteresis ratio between the firing rate difference at each pressure and the overall firing rate range (or Hmax) of 0.86 ± 0.09 (mean ± standard deviation) and mean hysteresis ratio (or Hmean) of 0.52 ± 0.13 (n = 46 afferents).

2,Shani Ross,Deep Brain Stimulation in the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala Decreases “Wanting” and “Liking” of Food Reward,"We investigated the potential of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in rats to modulate functional reward mechanisms. The CeA is the major output of the amygdala with direct connections to the hypothalamus and gustatory brainstem, and indirect connections with the nucleus accumbens. Further, the CeA has been shown to be involved in learning, emotional integration, reward processing, and regulation of feeding. We hypothesized that DBS, which is used to treat movement disorders and other brain dysfunctions, might block reward motivation. In rats performing a lever-pressing task to obtain sugar pellet rewards, we stimulated the CeA and control structures, and compared stimulation parameters. During CeA stimulation, animals stopped working for rewards and rejected freely available rewards. Taste reactivity testing during DBS exposed aversive reactions to normally liked sucrose tastes and even more aversive taste reactions to normally disliked quinine tastes. Interestingly, given the opportunity, animals implanted in the CeA would self-stimulate with 500 ms trains of stimulation at the same frequency and current parameters as continuous stimulation that would stop reward acquisition. Neural recordings during DBS showed that CeA neurons were still active and uncovered inhibitory-excitatory patterns after each stimulus pulse indicating possible entrainment of the neural firing with DBS. In summary, DBS modulation of CeA may effectively usurp normal neural activity patterns to create an ‘information lesion’ that not only decreased motivational ‘wanting’ of food rewards, but also blocked ‘liking’ of rewards.",5-Aug-16

Two hundred and sixty cases totaling more than 5,000 images have been scanned with a high resolution Kodak LS85 laser scanner. The database system and web-based search engine were developed using MySQL and PHP. The database has been evaluated by medical professionals, and the experimental results obtained so far are promising with high image quality and fast access time. We have also developed an image viewing system, D-Viewer, to display these digitized mammograms. This viewer is coded in Microsoft Visual C# and is intended to help medical professionals view and retrieve large data sets in near real time. Finally, we are currently developing an image content-based retrieval function for the database system to provide improved search capability for the medical professionals.",29-Mar-07
4,Shani Ross,Laminar Analysis of Movement Direction Information in Local Field Potentials of the Rat Motor Cortex,"Local field potentials (LFPs) have been proposed for use in controlling neural prosthetic devices because they can provide reliable motor and sensory-related information, and can easily be recorded over long periods of time. While studies have shown that directional information about motor movements can be inferred from LFPs, it is not known at what depth these signals should be recorded from in order to maximize the amount of movement information. Towards this end, we used a directional motor task in Long Evans rats, while sampling LFPs with an electrode consisting of 16 vertical recording sites that were evenly-spaced 100 microm apart. This allowed for simultaneous recording of all layers of the motor cortex. The frequency components of LFPs were then analyzed using k-means clustering to determine directional information as a function of depth. Here we report our initial findings that superficial layers (II/III) of motor cortex may provide more information about movement directions then deeper layers (V).",30-Aug-06

In this direction, intelligent micromachines may serve as active mechanical means to dislodge such deleterious bacterial communities. Herein, we have designed biocompatible micromotors from tea buds, namely, T-Budbots, which shows the capacity to be magnetically driven on a biofilm matrix and remove or fragment biofilms with precision, as a part of the proposed non-invasive “Kill-n-Clean” strategy. In a way, we present a bactericidal robotic platform decorated with magnetite nanoparticles aimed at clearing in vitro biofilms present on the surfaces. We have also shown that the smart porous T-Budbots can integrate antibiotic ciprofloxacin due to electrostatic interaction on their surface to increase their antibacterial efficacy against dreadful pathogenic bacterial communities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. It is noteworthy that the release of this drug can be controlled by tuning the surrounding pH of the T-Budbots. For example, while the acidic environment of the biofilm facilitates the release of antibiotics from the porous T-Budbots, the drug release was rather minimal at higher pH. The work represents a first step in the involvement of a plant-based microbot exhibiting magneto-robotic therapeutic properties, providing a non-invasive and safe approach to dismantle harmful biofilm infections.",31-Aug-20
1,Amit Kumar Singh,Magnetotactic Curcumin iButtonbots as Efficient Bactericidal Agents,"The microbial contamination of drinking water is one of the most major concerns of community health in the developing world. Numerous water-borne pathogens are rapidly evolving and becoming resistant to traditional antibiotics. To get an efficacious bactericidal response, an assembly of several antibiotics or increased dosage are being administered, which may produce adverse side effects after prolonged use. Here, we describe a proficient method for disinfecting water-borne coliform bacterial strains of Escherichia coli DH5α from contaminated water samples using magnetic microbots decorated with curcumin (CU) conjugates. These magnetic microbots, namely, iButtonbots were composed of soft Agaricus bisporus (button mushroom) microcapsules with inherit antimicrobial properties. The locomotives were coated with magnetite nanoparticles for their remote guidance towards cells and collection along with CU for more enhanced bactericidal response. CU, a major active constituent of the Indian dietary spice turmeric and edible button mushrooms are known to exhibit antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacterial species. The synergic antibacterial effect of CU and mushroom constituents, imparts a profound bactericidal property to these magnetic microbots. We have demonstrated that microbots are capable of efficiently killing majority of bacterial cells in contaminated water samples. After extermination of bacteria, magnetic properties of embedded magnetite nanoparticles in porous mushroom matrix, allows collection of microbots from water samples. The presented biocompatible microbots offer an innovative method for rapid decontamination of bacteria-laden drinking water samples.",20-Apr-20
2,Amit Kumar Singh,Magnetically Actuated Carbon Soot Nanoparticle-based Catalytic CARBOts Coated with Ni/Pt Nanofilms for Water Detoxification and Oil-Spill Recovery,"Multifunctional chemically powered micromotors were fabricated from the airborne contaminant carbon soot (CS) for environmental remediation following two approaches: first, by physical deposition of catalytic platinum (Pt) and magnetic nickel (Ni) nanoscale films of ∼110 nm and ∼100 nm, respectively, on CS (CARBOts) and second, by the chemical deposition of magneto-catalytic iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) of ∼30 nm or less in size on the CS surface (iCARBOts). The chemical synthesis of magneto-catalytic iron nanoparticle (FeNPs)-based iCARBOts provides an economical alternative to the synthesis of CARBOts by a physical method. The hydrophobic soot contained agglomerates of high-density carbon nanospheres of ∼40 nm or less in size, generated from the incomplete combustion of a hydrocarbon source. The catalytic component (Pt nanofilm or FeNPs) on the nanostructures on the CS surface allowed the rapid catalytic decomposition of aqueous peroxide fuel (H2O2) to generate chemical propulsion. These magneto-catalytic micromotors demonstrated the efficient catalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye in the presence of 10% (v/v) H2O2 fuel under ambient conditions. The CARBOts completely decolorized the nonbiodegradable MB dye pollutant within 40 min of treatment. The magnetic sensitivity of motors facilitated the ease of retrieval and reusability after the execution of the remediation tasks, thereby increasing the feasibility of the water detoxification process. In addition, with the help of remote magnetic guidance, micromotors were employed for the removal of freely floating and surfactant-stabilized oil droplets in seawater without any further surface modification.

3,Amit Kumar Singh,Acoustic Propulsion of Vitamin C Loaded Teabots for Targeted Oxidative Stress and Amyloid Therapeutics,"We report the fabrication of ascorbic acid (AA) template nanomotors using buds of Camelia sinensis, undergoing fuel-free propulsion. The motors, namely, Teabots, display propulsion by converting the sound energy from the acoustic field into a mechanical one. The mesh-like structures of the anionic Teabots facilitate superior adsorption of ascorbic acid (AA-Teabots) undergoing a controlled release. The motors show antioxidant properties at the physiological pH range by scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, the percentage release of ascorbic acid is significantly higher under the influence of ultrasound exposure, as compared to the normal pH-dependent release. The motors were also efficient in the degradation of artificially synthesized toxic amyloid fibrils. The acoustic delivery of AA-Teabots could protect HEK-293 cells from oxidative injuries alongside preventing protein-aggregation derived diseases. Soon, such acoustic powered biocompatible AA-Teabots are envisioned to provide an attractive approach in proficient delivery and controlled release of therapeutic payloads at targeted zones.",17-Sep-19
4,Amit Kumar Singh,Graphene oxide nanohybrids for electron transfer-mediated antimicrobial activity,"Herein, we report the facile synthesis of graphene oxide incorporated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc–GO) nanohybrids showing bactericidal activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells, in the absence of any photo-excitation. The ZnPc–GO hybrid nanomaterials were synthesized by the in situ deposition of GO flakes on ZnPc-coated indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Two types of morphologically different ZnPc molecules, potato-chip-like α-phase ZnPc, namely ZnPc(A), and nanorod-like β-phase ZnPc(B), were used for the synthesis of the ZnPc(A/B)–GO nanocomposites. The interactions of GO with the underlying ZnPc(A/B) entities in the ZnPc–GO systems were investigated using multiple characterization techniques. It was observed that the GO flakes in the ZnPc(B)–GO nanocomposite possess stronger π–π interactions and thus show a more efficient electron transfer mechanism when compared with the ZnPc(A) counterpart. Furthermore, the E. coli bacterial cells with an electronegative surface demonstrated a profound adherence to the electron-withdrawing ZnPc(B)–GO surface. The death kinetics of bacteria with ZnPc(B)–GO were further investigated using surface potential mapping and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analysis. Upon direct contact with ZnPc(B)–GO, the adhered bacterial cells showed outer cell deformation and membrane protein leakage, induced by a proposed charge-transfer mechanism between negatively charged cells and the electron-withdrawing ZnPc(B)–GO surface.

5,Amit Kumar Singh,Formic acid powered reusable autonomous ferrobots for efficient hydrogen generation under ambient conditions,"We report the design and development of a self-propelling ferrobot composed of a collection of iron nanoparticles (FeNPs). While the propulsive thrust required for the chemotactic migration of the ferrobots was generated through the ejection of hydrogen (H2) bubbles due to the reaction of aqueous formic acid (FA) with FeNP clusters on the motor surface, the presence of ferromagnetic FeNPs assured “on-the-fly” remote guidance using an external magnetic field. The speed of chemotactic migration of the motor was found to be highest when the rate of reaction was maximum in a 30% (v/v) aqueous FA solution. Directed propulsion of the ferrobot was also achieved by tuning the chemical gradient and magnetic field potentials across the ferrobot. Unlike previously reported systems where the FA decomposition is associated with either the production of the greenhouse gas CO2 or the use of high temperature, the proposed self-propelling ferrobots could react with aqueous FA fuel at room temperature to produce pure H2 gas. Thus, the ferrobots could further be employed to power a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell to rotate a portable toy fan. In this situation, while the pure H2 gas required for the PEM cell was generated through the reaction of the FA solution with self-propelling ferrobots, O2 gas was also produced by the catalytic decomposition of peroxide fuel using the ferrobots. Interestingly, the ferrobots and FA fuel could easily be regenerated for their repeated use towards the continuous production of pure hydrogen. The experiments uncovered the potential of the proposed ferrobots not only for the on-demand power supply to portable devices but also as a single-step commercial process to produce pure H2 under ambient conditions and devoid of greenhouse gas emission.",18-Apr-18
6,Amit Kumar Singh,Boolean-chemotaxis of logibots deciphering the motions of self-propelling microorganisms ,"We demonstrate the feasibility of a self-propelling mushroom motor, namely a ‘logibot’, as a functional unit for the construction of a host of optimized binary logic gates. Emulating the chemokinesis of unicellular prokaryotes or eukaryotes, the logibots made stimuli responsive conditional movements at varied speeds towards a pair of acid–alkali triggers. A series of integrative logic operations and cascaded logic circuits, namely, AND, NAND, NOT, OR, NOR, and NIMPLY, have been constructed employing the decisive chemotactic migrations of the logibot in the presence of the pH gradient established by the sole or coupled effects of acid (HCl-catalase) and alkali (NaOH) drips inside a peroxide bath. The imposed acid and/or alkali triggers across the logibots were realized as inputs while the logic gates were functionally reconfigured to several operational modes by varying the pH of the acid–alkali inputs. The self-propelling logibot could rapidly sense the external stimuli, decide, and act on the basis of intensities of the pH triggers. The impulsive responses of the logibots towards and away from the external acid–alkali stimuli were interpreted as the potential outputs of the logic gates. The external stimuli responsive self-propulsion of the logibots following different logic gates and circuits can not only be an eco-friendly alternative to the silicon-based computing operations but also be a promising strategy for the development of intelligent pH-responsive drug delivery devices.",30-Mar-18
7,Amit Kumar Singh,Organic vapor detection using nanoparticle laden droplet and the effect of viscosity and vapor-source distance,"A novel detection method of organic vapours has been studied. The vapour of different organic solvents creates a surface tension gradient on the surface of the droplet when the vapour source is brought near the vicinity of the droplet. The surface tension gradient creates a circulation or flow inside the liquid due to solutal Marangoni effect. The circulation of the liquid is electrically detected using a multimeter by measuring the change in electrical resistance across the droplet. The change in electrical resistance due to droplet rotation is found to be different for different vapours. Further, the effect of droplet viscosity and source distance have significant influence on the electrical response of the system. For example, with increasing viscosity and source distance, the change in electrical resistance decreases. To illustrate the phenomenon and explain the effect of viscosity and vapour source distance, a computational fluid dynamic simulation (CFD) has been implemented.",19-Oct-17
8,Amit Kumar Singh,Magnetic Field Guided Chemotaxis of iMushbots for Targeted Anticancer Therapeutics,"We report controlled migrations of an intelligent and biocompatible ‘iMushbot’ composed of Agaricus bisporus – mushroom microcapsules coated with magnetite nanoparticles. The otherwise randomly moving microbot could meticulously direct itself towards and away from the acid and alkali rich regions with the help of acid, acidic-catalase and alkali stimuli, emulating the chemotaxis of microorganisms. While the catalytic decomposition of peroxide-fuel in alkali engendered the directed alkali taxis towards higher pH region, decomposition of peroxide-fuel by the acidic-catalase activity led to directed acid taxis towards the lower pH region. Presence of magnetite nanoparticles not only helped in improving the ‘activity’ of the motor through the heterogeneous catalytic decomposition of the peroxide-fuel, but also provided a remote magnetic control on the chemotaxis. The mesoporous iMushbots having negative ζ-potential could easily be loaded with the cationic anti-cancer drugs, which were magnetically guided towards the cancerous cells to cause apoptosis. The iMushbots exhibited higher degree of drug retaining capacity inside alkaline pH and showed facile drug release preferentially in the lower pH environments. The experiments show the potential of the iMushbots in retaining and transporting drugs in alkaline medium such as human blood and releasing them in acidic medium such as the cancerous tissues for cell apoptosis.",22-Mar-17
9,Amit Kumar Singh,Detection of organic vapours employing droplets having nanoparticles,"In this paper, a droplet based organic vapour detection technique is discussed. The detection was based on solutal Marangoni effect where a strong circulation of fluid was observed inside a droplet once an organic vapour source was introduced near the vicinity of the droplet surface. The reason behind the rotational motion was the surface tension gradient created on the air-droplet and vapour-droplet interfaces. Different organic vapours produced rotational motion of different magnitudes inside the droplet based on the surface tension gradient created on air-droplet and vapour-droplet interfaces. In order to electrically detect the motion, a nanoparticle laden salt solution droplet was placed in between two copper electrodes and the electrodes were further connected to a digital multimeter for measuring the electrical resistance across the droplet. It was observed that there was a change in resistance when the droplet was set in motion by introducing an organic vapour source. A ~95% change in resistance was observed due to the flow circulation. It was also observed that the magnitude of change in resistance was different for different organic vapours. Thus, the system had the capability of being used as organic vapour sensor. A computational study was also performed in order to explain the phenomenon and to illustrate the effect of contact angle of the droplet.",9-Mar-17
10,Amit Kumar Singh,Self-spinning nanoparticle laden microdroplets for sensing and energy harvesting ,"Exposure of a volatile organic vapour could set in powerful rotational motion a microdroplet composed of an aqueous salt solution loaded with metal nanoparticles. The solutal Marangoni motion on the surface originating from the sharp difference in the surface tension of water and organic vapour stimulated the strong vortices inside the droplet. The vapour sources of methanol, ethanol, diethyl ether, toluene, and chloroform stimulated motions of different magnitudes could easily be correlated to the surface tension gradient on the drop surface. Interestingly, when the nanoparticle laden droplet of aqueous salt solution was connected to an external electric circuit through a pair of electrodes, an ∼85–95% reduction in the electrical resistance was observed across the spinning droplet. The extent of reduction in the resistance was found to have a correlation with the difference in the surface tension of the vapour source and the water droplet, which could be employed to distinguish the vapour sources. Remarkably, the power density of the same prototype was estimated to be around 7 μW cm−2, which indicated the potential of the phenomenon in converting surface energy into electrical in a non-destructive manner and under ambient conditions. Theoretical analysis uncovered that the difference in the ζ-potential near the electrodes was the major reason for the voltage generation. The prototype could also detect the repeated exposure and withdrawal of vapour sources, which helped in the development of a proof-of-concept detector to sense alcohol issuing out of the human breathing system.",17-Feb-16
11,Amit Kumar Singh,Graphene based multifunctional superbots,"A versatile graphene coated glass microswimmer displayed directed motions under the influence of applied electric field, chemical potential gradient and external magnetic field. The directed chemical locomotion took place from the region of lower to higher pH with speed ∼13 body lengths per second due to asymmetric catalytic decomposition of dilute hydrogen peroxide across the motor surface. The negative surface potential of graphene coated motor developed an electrical double layer in an alkaline medium which in turn engendered electrophoretic mobility towards anode when the external electrostatic field was applied. Inclusion of sparsely populated ferromagnetic iron nanoparticles on the surface of the motor offered the magnetic remote control on the motion. The coupled in situ and external controls enabled the motor to develop complex motions in diverse open and confined environments. For example, the motor could approach, pick-up, tow, and release a heavy cargo inside microchannel. Remarkably, the motor (∼67 μg) could successfully drive out a ∼1000 times heavier payload (∼0.67 mg) displaying the ability to overcome the drag force of ∼2619 pN with the help of coupled in situ and remote guidance.",1-Aug-15
12,Amit Kumar Singh,Capillary force mediated flow patterns and non-monotonic pressure drop characteristics of oil-water microflows,"We report the capillary and frictional force mediated transitions of morphologies of an oil-water flow inside a microchannel using experiments and computational fluid dynamic simulations. A number of steady and time-periodic flow patterns were reported with the variations in the interfacial tension, exchange of inlets, flow ratio, and viscosity ratio of the phases. Transitions from slug to plug to droplet to stratified flow patterns were obtained by tuning the interfacial tension. Progressive reduction in the interfacial tension transformed big slugs into smaller plugs, plugs into droplets, and droplets into a stratified flow pattern. Interestingly, the simulations uncovered a non-monotonic and nonlinear reduction in pressure drop with the decrease in interfacial tension. The change in the pressure drop was correlated to the variation in the slug, plug, or droplet frequency of water at the outlet. The variations in the pressure drop were also associated with the transition from dripping to jetting of water droplet ejection near the channel inlet. Apart from the interfacial tension, the viscosity stratification across the phases was also found to play an important role in converting the slug flow patterns into smaller plugs or droplets. The study also reports the parametric space in which the droplet flow patterns could be obtained inside a microchannel tuning the flow and viscosity ratios of the phases alongside the interfacial tension. The reported transitions of flow patterns and the pressure drop characteristics can be of significance in improving the efficiency of future microfluidic devices.",31-Jul-15

The otherwise diffusive motion of the motor was meticulously directed through an in situ pH-gradient and an external magnetic field. The self-propulsion owing to the asymmetric catalytic decomposition of peroxide fuel was directed through a pH gradient imposed across the motor-surface, while the magnetic field induced an external control on the movement and the speed of the motor. Interestingly, the sole influence of the pH gradient could move the motor as high as [similar]25 body lengths per second, which was further magnified by the external assistance from the magnetic field. Applying a magnetic field against the pH directed motion helped in the quantitative experimental estimation of the force-field required to arrest the chemotactic migration. The influence of the coupled internal and external fields could halt, steer or reverse the direction the motor inside a microchannel, rotate the motor around a target, and deliver the motor to a cluster of cells.

16,Amit Kumar Singh,Target Identification by In-Silico studies on NS1 proteins of Bird Flu Virus,"Avian influenza, or 'bird flu', is a contagious disease of animals caused by Influenza viruses that normally infect only birds and, less commonly, pigs. Avian influenza viruses are highly species-specific, but have, on rare occasions, crossed the species barrier to infect humans. There are several different types of avian viruses (type A, B, C with each type having several subtypes) and they are constantly evolving. And this ability of influenza viruses to change their genetic makeup and to swap genes makes them unpredictable and potentially deadly. In this work the focus was on the translated NS1 protein of the H5N1 virus (as it is responsible for pathogenesis and elevation in levels of cytokines during infection) along with a comparative study of H5N1's translated NS1 protein with the translated NS1 protein of the other pandemic virus (H1N1, H2N2, H3N2) infecting humans, avian and swine. Attempt has been done to determine and create the 3D structure of the consensus protein sequence translated from the Nonstructural NS1 gene within the host cells by H5N1 flu viruses. After comparing the NS1 protein sequence of H5N1 along with the other three pandemic viruses' translated NS1 protein sequence, a common region/domain has been identified which seems to have remain conserved in all pandemic flu viruses including H5N1 subtype. A drug/vaccine can be devised to attack this conserved site as this site is present in all pandemic flu viruses which is unaffected by mutations in the viruses. So the drug/vaccine can be more effective in combating the H5N1 virus if it interacts with this conserved region thereby decreasing the severity of the disease and mortality rate. ",1-Jan-08

Knowledge of such microparticle behavior at gas turbine operating temperatures is limited in published literature. In this study, Arizona road dust (ARD) is injected into a hot flow field to measure the effects of high temperature and velocity on particle rebound from a polished 304 stainless steel (SS) coupon. The results are compared with baseline (27 m/s) measurements at ambient (300 K) temperature made in the Virginia Tech Aerothermal Rig, as well as previously published literature. Mean coefficient of restitution (COR) was shown to decrease with the increased temperature/velocity conditions in the VT Aerothermal Rig. The effects of increasing temperature and velocity led to a 12% average reduction in COR at 533 K (47 m/s), 15% average reduction in COR at 866 K (77 m/s), and 16% average reduction in COR at 1073 K (102 m/s) compared with ambient results. The decrease in COR appeared to be almost entirely a result of increased velocity that resulted from heating the flow.

A laser and camera system is used in the Virginia Tech Aerothermal Rig to measure velocity trajectories of microparticles. The method solves for particle impact velocity at the impact surface using a CFD solution and Lagrangian particle tracking. The methodology presented here attempts to characterize a difficult problem by a combination of established techniques, PTV and CFD, which have not been used in this capacity before. Erosion and deposition are functions of particle/wall interactions and COR is a fundamental property of these interactions. COR depends on impact velocity, angle of impact, temperature, particle composition, and wall material. Two sizes of Arizona road dust and one size of glass beads are impacted on to a 304 stainless steel coupon. The particles are entrained into a free jet of 27 m s−1 at room temperature. Impact angle was varied from 85° to 25° depending on particle. Mean results collected using this new technique compare favorably with trends established in literature. The utilization of this technique to measure COR of microparticle sand will help develop a computational model and serve as a baseline for further measurements at elevated air and wall temperatures.",4-Sep-13
2,Colin Reagle,Sand Transport in a Two Pass Internal Cooling Duct with Rib Turbulators,"A two pass stationary square duct with rib turbulators subjected to sand ingestion is studied using Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Each pass has ribs on two opposite walls and aligned normal to the main flow direction. The rib pitch to rib height (P/e) is 9.28, the rib height to channel hydraulic diameter (e/Dh) is 0.0625 and calculations have been carried out for a bulk Reynolds number of 25,000. Particle sizes in the range 0.5–25 μm are considered, with the same size distribution as found in Arizona Road Dust (medium). Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with wall-model is used to model the flow and sand particles are modeled using a discrete Lagrangian framework. 220,000 particles are injected at the inlet and perfectly elastic collisions with the wall are considered. Results quantify the distribution of particle impingement density on all surfaces. Highest particle impingement density is found in the first quarter section of the second pass after the 180° turn, where the recorded impingement is more than twice that of any other region. It is also found that the average particle impingement per pitch is 28% higher in the second pass than the first pass. Results show lower particle tendency to hit the region immediately behind the rib in the first pass compared to the second pass where particle impingement is more uniform in the region between two ribs. The smooth walls do not show much particle impingement except the wall in second pass where the flow impinges after the turn. The rib face facing the flow is by far is the most susceptible to impingement and hence deposition and erosion. The results of this simulation were also compared with results obtained from experiments conducted on an identical two pass geometry with Arizona Road Dust particles. The particle impingement pattern is recorded by using a sticky tape on all surfaces to capture the particles. The numerical predictions showed good qualitative agreement with experimental measurements.",8-Jul-12

0,Michael Hieb,The Operations Intent and Effects Model: A Command and Control Methodology for Increased Automation,"Command and Control (C2) is viewed as an increasing important part of future military 
technologies. While recent C2 theory has focused on desirable features of complex organizations, 
such as Agility, and emerging work is looking at social media approaches – the key issues for 
many nations and programs are how to integrate and benefit from increased automation. Rapid 
advanced in Robotic and Simulation technologies are very apparent and challenge the current C2 
methodologies that rely upon intensive human intervention and monitoring. Future C2 will need 
to accommodate “mixed” forces of Humans and Robots.
The uncertainty inherent in an actual mission, and the variety of potential organizations that 
support the mission after it is underway, makes Command Intent (CI) a critical concept for 
automated C2 systems. Both humans and decision support services (including simulations) within 
a C2 system need to have the ability to communicate and interpret a shared CI. The Operations 
Intent and Effects Model (OIEM) identifies the relationships between Intent, Actions, and Effects 
in a C2 framework. We describe this model and show how it can represen",1-Jun-13

0,Dorin Marcu,Argumentation-based Approach to Scientific Investigation: The Role of Cover Crops in Weed Suppression,"Weed management is a major challenge in conventional and organic production systems, amplified by the increasing resistance of weeds to herbicides. Cover crops offer a particularly promising strategy for management, as they minimize selection pressure by herbicides and synergistically improve weed control with existing herbicides, but the precise mechanisms through which cover crops provide weed suppression are not well-understood. Current approaches to scientific investigation use statistical machine learning to discover knowledge from data. This paper proposes a different artificial intelligence approach that synergistically integrates evidence-based reasoning, argumentation-based explanations, multi-strategy learning, and hypothesis-guided search in farm data to discover knowledge on how climate, soil, and weed seedbank size interact with cover crop biomass to drive weed suppression. The presented approach works with both large and small amounts of farm data, and is also applicable to other agricultural and food production domains.",4-Nov-21
1,Dorin Marcu,A Framework for Deep Anticipatory Intelligence Analysis,"Anticipatory intelligence is the complex task of identifying and assessing new, emerging trends, changing conditions, and underappreciated developments to challenge long- standing assumptions, encourage new perspectives, identify new opportunities, and provide warning of threats to national interests, based on current information of all kinds that come from a variety of different sources. This paper presents a framework for anticipatory intelligence analysis to be implemented into an instructable agent that can be taught how to assist an analyst.",4-Nov-21
2,Dorin Marcu,Shared Model of Sense-making for Human-Machine Collaboration,"We present a model of sense-making that greatly facilitates the collaboration between an intelligent analyst and a knowledge-based agent. It is a general model grounded in the science of evidence and the scientific method of hypothesis generation and testing, where sense-making hypotheses that explain an observation are generated, relevant evidence is then discovered, and the hypotheses are tested based on the discovered evidence. We illustrate how the model enables an analyst to directly instruct the agent to understand situations involving the possible production of weapons (e.g., chemical warfare agents) and how the agent becomes increasingly more competent in understanding other situations from that domain (e.g., possible production of centrifuge-enriched uranium or of stealth fighter aircraft).",4-Nov-21
3,Dorin Marcu,Prediction-Driven Knowledge Discovery from Data and Prior Knowledge,"This paper presents a novel approach to knowledge discovery. As opposed to the vast majority of existing approaches that use statistical machine learning to discover knowledge from data, we synergistically integrate ideas from artificial intelligence, machine learning, science of evidence, logic and probabilities to use both existing incomplete domain knowledge and imperfect data to discover new knowledge. We illustrate this approach in the precision agriculture domain considering the practices associated with cover crops, and learning how abiotic and biotic factors and cover crops management practices (planting and termination dates and methods) influence cereal cover crop biomass accumulation across corn-growing, soybean-growing, and cotton-growing regions of the U.S.",4-Nov-21
4,Dorin Marcu,Automating the Investigation of Sophisticated Cyber Threats with Cognitive Agents,"This chapter presents an approach to orchestrating security incident response investigations using cognitive agents trained to detect sophisticated cyber threats and integrated into cybersecurity operations centers. After briefly introducing advanced persistent threats (APTs), it overviews the APT detection model and how agents are trained. It then describes how hypotheses that may explain security alerts are generated using collected data and threat intelligence, how the analyses of these hypotheses guide the collection of additional evidence, the design of the Collection Manager software, used to integrate cognitive agents with selected collection agents, how results of searches are added to the knowledge base as evidence, and how the generated hypotheses are tested using this evidence. These concepts are illustrated with an example of detecting an APT attack. We finally overview our experimental method and results.",22-Jan-21
5,Dorin Marcu,"Instructing a Cognitive Agent to Perform Sensemaking in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance","This paper presents progress made towards the development of a theory, methodology and instructable system for automated analysis in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. An intelligence analyst shows the system how to make sense of a suspicious alert by following the scientific method of hypothesis generation and testing, and the system learns general rules to make sense of similar alerts. We believe that the approach we are developing has several significant advantages over the current manual approach to sensemaking in terms of speed, quality, and transparency of analysis, which more than compensate for the extra effort needed to train the agent. In particular, it significantly improves and accelerates the understanding of the goals and behavior of entities of interest, and enables the early identification of potential threats.",10-Aug-20
6,Dorin Marcu,Instructable Cognitive Agents for Autonomous Evidence-Based Reasoning,"This paper presents a general approach to the development of instructable cognitive agents for automated evidence-based reasoning. This is based on a framework, grounded in the scientific method, for generating and testing hypotheses that explain events of interest, and on an instructable agent shell that implements this framework. The agent shell is customized into two different systems, one for automated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and the other for cybersecurity. A domain expert teaches the agent through explained examples of investigations of alerts. The agent learns by generalizing these examples, being able to autonomously conduct similar investigations, as demonstrated in an experiment in the area of cybersecurity.",1-Dec-19
7,Dorin Marcu,Toward a Computational Theory of Evidence-Based Reasoning for Instructable Cognitive Agents,"Evidence-based reasoning is at the core of many problem-solving and decision-making tasks in a wide variety of domains. Generalizing from the research and development of cognitive agents in several such domains, this paper presents progress toward a computational theory for the development of instructable cognitive agents for evidence-based reasoning tasks. The paper also illustrates the application of this theory to the development of four prototype cognitive agents in domains that are critical to the government and the public sector. Two agents function as cognitive assistants, one in intelligence analysis, and the other in science education. The other two agents operate autonomously, one in cybersecurity and the other in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The paper concludes with the directions of future research on the proposed computational theory.",7-Nov-19

A powerful learning agent shell, Disciple-EBR, is included with the book, enabling students, practitioners, and researchers to develop cognitive assistants rapidly in a wide variety of domains that require evidence-based reasoning, including intelligence analysis, cybersecurity, law, forensics, medicine, and education.",8-Sep-16
11,Dorin Marcu,"Intelligence Analysis as Discovery of Evidence, Hypotheses, and Arguments: Connecting the Dots","This unique book on intelligence analysis covers several vital but often overlooked topics. It teaches the evidential and inferential issues involved in 'connecting the dots' to draw defensible and persuasive conclusions from masses of evidence: from observations we make, or questions we ask, we generate alternative hypotheses as explanations or answers; we make use of our hypotheses to generate new lines of inquiry and discover new evidence; and we test the hypotheses with the discovered evidence. To facilitate understanding of these issues and enable the performance of complex analyses, the book introduces an intelligent analytical tool, called Disciple-CD. Readers will practice with Disciple-CD and learn how to formulate hypotheses; develop arguments that reduce complex hypotheses to simpler ones; collect evidence to evaluate the simplest hypotheses; and assess the relevance and the believability of evidence, which combine in complex ways to determine its inferential force and the probabilities of the hypotheses.",30-Aug-16
