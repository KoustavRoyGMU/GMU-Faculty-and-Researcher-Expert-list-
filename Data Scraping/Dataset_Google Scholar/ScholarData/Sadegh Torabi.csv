Detecting Internet Abuse by Analyzing Passive DNS Traffic: A Survey of Implemented Systems,"Sadegh Torabi, Amine Boukhtouta, Chadi Assi, Mourad Debbabi",2018,Journal IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials,"Despite the ubiquitous role of domain name system (DNS) in sustaining the operations of various Internet services (domain name to IP address resolution, e-mail, Web), DNS was abused/misused to perform large-scale attacks that affected millions of Internet users. To detect and prevent threats associated to DNS, researchers introduced passive DNS replication and analysis as an effective alternative approach for analyzing live DNS traffic. In this paper, we survey state of the art systems that utilized passive DNS traffic for the purpose of detecting malicious behaviors on the Internet. We highlight the main strengths and weaknesses of the implemented systems through an in-depth analysis of the detection approach, collected data, and detection outcomes. We highlight an incremental implementation pattern in the studied systems with similarities in terms of the used datasets and detection approach. Furthermore, we …",55

Privacy Aspects of Health Related Information Sharing in Online Social Networks.,"Sadegh Torabi, Konstantin Beznosov",2013/8/12,Conference USENIX Workshop on Health Information Technologies (HealthTech '13),"Online social networks (OSNs) have formed virtual social networks where people meet and share information. Among all shared information, health related information (HRI) has received considerable attention from researchers and individual users. While considered beneficial, sharing HRI, which is personal in nature, comes with its privacy drawback. Privacy is a process of boundary regulation that is related to the individual and her perception of the surrounding environment. As a result, the subjective privacy risk perceptions associated with sharing HRI in OSN have driven people to adopt different types of behaviour, both in terms of HRI sharing and privacy risk mitigation.",22

Network robustness and irreversibility of information diffusion in complex networks,"Maytham Safar, Khaled Mahdi, Sadeq Torabi",2011/8/31,Journal Journal of Computational Science,"Complex networks are characterized based on a newly proposed parameter, “degree of diffusion α”. It defines the ratio of information adopters to non-adopters within a diffusion process over consecutive penetration depths. Furthermore, the perfectness of a social network is evaluated by exploring different variations of α such as the reverse diffusion (αreverse) and the random-kill-diffusion (RKD) processes. The analysis of αreverse and RKD processes shows information diffusion irreversibility in small-world and scale-free but not in random networks. It also shows that random networks are more stable toward attacks, resulting a complete information diffusion process over the entire network. Finally, a real Complex network example, represented as a “virtual friendship network” was analyzed and found to share properties of both random and small-world networks. Therefore, it is characterized to be somewhere …",14
A model of diffusion parameter characterizing social networks,"Khaled Mahdi, Maytham Safar, Sadegh Torabi",2009,Journal IADIS international conference e-society,"We introduce a new diffusion property to characterize different models of social networks; the “Degree of Diffusion α”.

"Sharing Health Information on Facebook: Practices, Preferences, and Risk Perceptions of North American Users","Sadegh Torabi, Konstantin Beznosov",2016/6/22,Conference Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS 2016),"Motivated by the benefits, people have used a variety of webbased services to share health information (HI) online. Among these services, Facebook, which enjoys the largest population of active subscribers, has become a common place for sharing various types of HI. At the same time, Facebook was shown to be vulnerable to various attacks, resulting in unintended information disclosure, privacy invasion, and information misuse. As such, Facebook users face the dilemma of benefiting from HI sharing and risking their privacy. In this work, we investigate HI sharing practices, preferences, and risk perceptions among Facebook users. We interviewed 21 participants with chronic health conditions to identify the key factors that influence users’ motivation to share HI on Facebook. We then conducted an online survey with 492 Facebook users in order to validate, refine, and extend our findings. While some factors related to sharing HI were found in literature, we provide a deeper understanding of the main factors that influenced users’ motivation to share HI on Facebook. The results suggest that the gained benefits from prior HI sharing experiences, and users’ overall attitudes toward privacy, correlate with their motivation to disclose HI. Furthermore, we identify other factors, specifically users’ perceived health and the audience of the shared HI, that appear to be linked with users’ motivation to share HI. Finally, we suggest design improvements—such as anonymous identity as well as search and recommendation features—for facilitating HI sharing on Facebook and similar sites.",8

Investigating the Security of EV Charging Mobile Applications As an Attack Surface,"KHALED Sarieddine, MA Sayed, SADEGH Torabi, RIBAL Atallah, CHADI Assi",2022/11/19,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.10603,"The adoption rate of EVs has witnessed a significant increase in recent years driven by multiple factors, chief among which is the increased flexibility and ease of access to charging infrastructure. To improve user experience, increase system flexibility and commercialize the charging process, mobile applications have been incorporated into the EV charging ecosystem. EV charging mobile applications allow consumers to remotely trigger actions on charging stations and use functionalities such as start/stop charging sessions, pay for usage, and locate charging stations, to name a few. In this paper, we study the security posture of the EV charging ecosystem against remote attacks, which exploit the insecurity of the EV charging mobile applications as an attack surface. We leverage a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to analyze the security of widely used EV charging mobile applications. Our analysis of 31 widely used mobile applications and their interactions with various components such as the cloud management systems indicate the lack of user/vehicle verification and improper authorization for critical functions, which lead to remote (dis)charging session hijacking and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against the EV charging station. Indeed, we discuss specific remote attack scenarios and their impact on the EV users. More importantly, our analysis results demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging existing vulnerabilities across various EV charging mobile applications to perform wide-scale coordinated remote charging/discharging attacks against the connected critical infrastructure (e.g., power grid), with significant undesired …",3
Towards understanding users' motivation to share health information on Facebook,Sadegh Torabi,2016,Institution University of British Columbia,"Motivated by the two-way benefits, people have used a variety of web-based services to share health information (HI) online. Among these services, Facebook, which enjoys the largest population of active subscribers, has become a common place for sharing various types of HI. At the same time, Facebook was shown to be vulnerable to various attacks, resulting in unintended information disclosure, privacy invasion, and information misuse. As such, Facebook users face the dilemma of benefiting from HI sharing and risking their privacy. In this work, we investigate HI sharing practices, preferences, and risk perceptions among Facebook users. Our exploration focused on two main goals:(1) to identify the key factors that influenced users’ motivation to share HI on Facebook, and (2) to highlight a number of features that could motivate people toward engaging in effective HI sharing on Facebook. To achieve these goals, we first surveyed 166 active Facebook users about their HI sharing practices and risk perceptions. We quantified HI sharing practices and confirmed that it has become a common practice among users. Moreover, we found that the type of the shared HI and its recipients, can highly influence users’ perceived privacy risks when sharing HI.

RPM: Ransomware Prevention and Mitigation Using Operating Systems' Sensing Tactics,"Ricardo Misael Ayala Molina, Elias Bou-Harb, Khaled Sarieddine, Sadegh Torabi, Chadi Assi",2023/5,Conference IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC2023),"Ransomware, an extortion type of malware, continues to create havoc targeting critical infrastructure and organizations at large, causing an estimated $20 Billion in direct and collateral damages in 2022. While significant efforts from both academia and industry are being pledged to address this debilitating and disrupting phenomena, the ransomware pandemic continues to expand rapidly in frequency, spread and stealthiness. To this end, in this work, we propose RPM, a Ransomware Prevention and Mitigation scheme. RPM is rooted in the proactive analysis of operating systems’ API artifacts through the exploitation of a neat observation related to ransomware behavior, namely, activities generated prior to the actual execution of the malicious payloads. RPM employs OS-centric process hooking tactics to develop an offensive approach leveraging such sensing activities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RPM, we empirically evaluated it using 100 of the most prominent ransomware samples. The results demonstrate very motivating accuracy metrics with low system footprint, asserting the rationale of the proposed scheme. We posture RPM as a strong step towards proactive mitigation, which aims at complimenting ongoing ransomware thwarting efforts.",

However, the benefits of containers come at the cost of weak isolation for the underlying shared OS kernel. To enhance the security of containers, it is critical to customize secure configurations for each specific container, including the system call list and the capability list. However, existing solutions mainly focus on system call profiling and most of these approaches still demand huge human efforts to manually configure and successfully run each container. Moreover, the dependency between capability and system call has not been considered and cross-checked during the profiling process.

Data-Driven Approaches for Detecting Malware-Infected IoT Devices and Characterizing Their Unsolicited Behaviors by Leveraging Passive Internet Measurements,Sadegh Torabi,2021/4/8,Institution Concordia University,"Despite the benefits of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the insecurity of IoT and their deployment nature have turned them into attractive targets for adversaries, which contributed to the rise of IoT-tailored malware as a major threat to the Internet ecosystem. In this thesis, we address the threats associated with the emerging IoT malware, which utilize exploited devices to perform large-scale cyber attacks (e.g., DDoS). To mitigate such threat, there is a need to possess an Internet perspective of the deployed IoT devices while building a better understanding about the behavioral characteristic of malware-infected devices, which is challenging due to the lack of empirical data and knowledge about the deployed IoT devices and their behavioral characteristics.   To address these challenges, in this thesis, we leverage passive Internet measurements and IoT device information to detect exploited IoT devices and investigate their generated traffic at the network telescope (darknet). We aim at proposing data-driven approaches for effective and near real-time IoT threat detection and characterization. Additionally, we leverage a specialized IoT Honeypot to analyze a large corpus of real IoT malware binary executable.
