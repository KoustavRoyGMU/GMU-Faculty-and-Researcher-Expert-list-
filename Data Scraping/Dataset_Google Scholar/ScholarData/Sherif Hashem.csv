Optimal Linear Combinations of Neural Networks,Sherif Hashem,1997,Journal Neural Networks,"Neural network-based modeling often involves trying multiple networks with different architectures and training parameters in order to achieve acceptable model accuracy. Typically, one of the trained networks is chosen as best, while the rest are discarded. Hashem and Schmeiser (1995) proposed using optimal linear combinations of a number of trained neural networks instead of using a single best network. Combining the trained networks may help integrate the knowledge acquired by the components networks and thus improve model accuracy. In this paper, we extend the idea of optimal linear combinations (OLCs) of neural networks and discuss issues related to the generalization ability of the combined model. We then present two algorithms for selecting the component networks for the combination to improve the generalization ability of OLCs.

Treating harmful collinearity in neural network ensembles,S. Hashem,1999,Book Combining artificial neural nets: ensemble and modular multi-net systems,"In the last decade, several techniques have been developed for combining neural networks [48, 49]. Combining a number of trained neural networks to form what is often referred to as a neural network ensemble, may yield better model accuracy without requiring extensive efforts in training the individual networks or optimising their architecture [21, 48]. However, because the corresponding outputs of the individual networks approximate the same physical quantity (or quantities), they may be highly positively correlated or collinear (linearly dependent). Thus, the estimation of the optimal weights for combining such networks may be subjected to the harmful effects of Collinearity, resulting in a neural network ensemble with inferior generalisation ability compared to the individual networks [20, 42, 48].",687
Improving model accuracy using optimal linear combinations of trained neural networks,"Sherif Hashem, Bruce Schmeiser",1995/5,Journal IEEE Transactions on neural networks,"Neural network (NN) based modeling often requires trying multiple networks with different architectures and training parameters in order to achieve an acceptable model accuracy. Typically, only one of the trained networks is selected as ""best"" and the rest are discarded. The authors propose using optimal linear combinations (OLC's) of the corresponding outputs on a set of NN's as an alternative to using a single network. Modeling accuracy is measured by mean squared error (MSE) with respect to the distribution of random inputs. Optimality is defined by minimizing the MSE, with the resultant combination referred to as MSE-OLC. The authors formulate the MSE-OLC problem for trained NN's and derive two closed-form expressions for the optimal combination-weights. An example that illustrates significant improvement in model accuracy as a result of using MSE-OLC's of the trained networks is included.< >",248

Self-generating prototypes for pattern classification,"Hatem A Fayed, Sherif R Hashem, Amir F Atiya",2007/5/1,Journal Pattern Recognition,"Prototype classifiers are a type of pattern classifiers, whereby a number of prototypes are designed for each class so as they act as representatives of the patterns of the class. Prototype classifiers are considered among the simplest and best performers in classification problems. However, they need careful positioning of prototypes to capture the distribution of each class region and/or to define the class boundaries. Standard methods, such as learning vector quantization (LVQ), are sensitive to the initial choice of the number and the locations of the prototypes and the learning rate. In this article, a new prototype classification method is proposed, namely self-generating prototypes (SGP). The main advantage of this method is that both the number of prototypes and their locations are learned from the training set without much human intervention.

Effects of collinearity on combining neural networks,Sherif Hashem,1996/12/1,Journal Connection Science,"Collinearity or linear dependency among a number of estimators may pose a serious problem when combining these estimators.

A comparison of the two paradigms shows that OLAM is superior to linear perception for this application. Both networks have a linear response and are useful in determining the composition of an unknown sample when the spectrum of the unknown is a linear superposition of known spectra. One feature of this technique is that it uses the whole spectrum in the identification process instead of only the individual photo-peaks. For this reason, it is potentially more useful for processing data from lower resolution gamma-ray spectrometers.
