Novel injectable neutral solutions of chitosan form biodegradable gels in situ,"A Chenite, C Chaput, D Wang, C Combes, MD Buschmann, CD Hoemann, JC Leroux, BL Atkinson, F Binette, A Selmani",2000/11/1,Journal Biomaterials,"A novel approach to provide, thermally sensitive neutral solutions based on chitosan/polyol salt combinations is described. These formulations possess a physiological pH and can be held liquid below room temperature for encapsulating living cells and therapeutic proteins; they form monolithic gels at body temperature. When injected in vivo the liquid formulations turn into gel implants in situ. This system was used successfully to deliver biologically active growth factors in vivo as well as an encapsulating matrix for living chondrocytes for tissue engineering applications. This study reports for the first time the use of polymer/polyol salt aqueous solutions as gelling systems, suggesting the discovery of a prototype for a new family of thermosetting gels highly compatible with biological compounds.",1701

In vitro osteogenesis assays: influence of the primary cell source on alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization,"CD18842361 Hoemann, H El-Gabalawy, MD McKee",2009/6/1,Source Pathologie Biologie,"In trabecular bone fracture repair in vivo, osteogenesis occurs through endochondral ossification under hypoxic conditions, or through woven bone deposition in the vicinity of blood vessels. In vitro osteogenesis assays are routinely used to test osteoblastic responses to drugs, hormones, and biomaterials for bone and cartilage repair applications. These cell culture models recapitulate events that occur in woven bone synthesis, and are carried out using primary osteoblasts, osteoblast precursors such as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), or various osteoblast cell lines. With time in culture, cell differentiation is typically assessed by examining levels of alkaline phosphatase activity (an early osteoblast marker) and by evaluating the assembly of a collagen (type I)-containing fibrillar extracellular matrix that mineralizes. In this review, we have made a comparative analysis of published …",369
Chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood implants improve hyaline cartilage repair in ovine microfracture defects,"Caroline D Hoemann, Mark Hurtig, Evgeny Rossomacha, Jun Sun, Anik Chevrier, Matthew S Shive, Michael D Buschmann",2005/12/1,Journal JBJS,"Background: Microfracture is a surgical procedure that is used to treat focal articular cartilage defects. Although joint function improves following microfracture, the procedure elicits incomplete repair. As blood clot formation in the microfracture defect is an essential initiating event in microfracture therapy, we hypothesized that the repair would be improved if the microfracture defect were filled with a blood clot that was stabilized by the incorporation of a thrombogenic and adhesive polymer, specifically, chitosan. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate (1) blood clot adhesion in fresh microfracture defects and (2) the quality of the repair, at six months postoperatively, of microfracture defects that had been treated with or without chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood clot implants, using a sheep model.",366

The potential of chitosan-based gels containing intervertebral disc cells for nucleus pulposus supplementation,"Peter Roughley, Caroline Hoemann, Eric DesRosiers, Fackson Mwale, John Antoniou, Mauro Alini",2006/1/1,Journal Biomaterials,"The suitability of chitosan-based hydrogels as scaffolds for the encapsulation of intervertebral disc (IVD) cells and the accumulation of a functional extracellular matrix mimicking that of the nucleus pulposus (NP) was investigated. The specific hypothesis under study was that the cationic chitosan would form an ideal environment in which large quantities of newly synthesized anionic proteoglycan could be entrapped. Indeed, all the formulations of cell-seeded chitosan hydrogels, studied under in vitro culture conditions, showed that the majority of proteoglycan produced by encapsulated NP cells was retained within the gel rather than released into the culture medium. This was not always the case when annulus fibrosus cells were encapsulated, as unlike the nucleus cells the annulus cells often did not survive when cultured in chitosan. The results support the concept that chitosan may be a suitable scaffold for cell …",306
Drilling and microfracture lead to different bone structure and necrosis during bone‐marrow stimulation for cartilage repair,"Hongmei Chen, Jun Sun, Caroline D Hoemann, Viorica Lascau‐Coman, Wei Ouyang, Marc D McKee, Matthew S Shive, Michael D Buschmann",2009/11,Journal Journal of Orthopaedic Research,"Bone marrow stimulation is performed using several surgical techniques that have not been systematically compared or optimized for a desired cartilage repair outcome. In this study, we investigated acute osteochondral characteristics following microfracture and comparing to drilling in a mature rabbit model of cartilage repair. Microfracture holes were made to a depth of 2 mm and drill holes to either 2 mm or 6 mm under cooled irrigation. Animals were sacrificed 1 day postoperatively and subchondral bone assessed by histology and micro‐CT. We confirmed one hypothesis that microfracture produces fractured and compacted bone around holes, essentially sealing them off from viable bone marrow and potentially impeding repair. In contrast, drilling cleanly removed bone from the holes to provide access channels to marrow stroma. Our second hypothesis that drilling would cause greater osteocyte death than …",288
Frequent provirus insertional mutagenesis of Notch1 in thymomas of MMTVD/myc transgenic mice suggests a collaboration of c-myc and Notch1 for oncogenesis.,"Luc Girard, Zaher Hanna, Normand Beaulieu, Caroline D Hoemann, Carole Simard, Christine A Kozak, Paul Jolicoeur",1996/8/1,Journal Genes & development,"The MMTVD/myc transgenic mice spontaneously develop oligoclonal CD4+CD8+ T-cell tumors. We used provirus insertional mutagenesis in these mice to identify putative collaborators of c-myc. We found that Notch1 was mutated in a high proportion (52%) of these tumors. Proviruses were inserted upstream of the exon coding for the transmembrane domain and in both transcriptional orientations. These mutations led to high expression of truncated Notch1 RNAs and proteins (86-110 kD). In addition, many Notch1-rearranged tumors showed elevated levels of full-length Notch1 transcripts, whereas nearly all showed increased levels of full-length (330-kD) or close to full-length (280-kD) Notch1 proteins. The 5' end of the truncated RNAs were determined for some tumors by use of RT-PCR and 5' RACE techniques.

The development of new treatments for meniscus injury is intimately related to the appropriateness of animal models for their investigation. The purpose of this study was to structurally compare human menisci to sheep and rabbit menisci to generate pertinent animal models for meniscus repair. Menisci were analyzed histologically, immunohistochemically, and by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). In all species, collagen I appeared throughout most menisci, but was absent from the inner portion of the tip in some samples.

Existing methods to solubilize cartilage matrix proteoglycans and cellular DNA for quantification, such as papain digestion, often destroy one or more species of the above-named parameters, in order to render others measurable. We have therefore developed a methodology to measure specific levels of mRNA, protein, DNA, glycosaminoglycan, and collagen content on single pulverized 10-mg samples of cartilage, or tissue-engineered cartilage, using successive extractions in concentrated guanidine hydrochloride (GuCl) and guanidine thiocyanate (GITC) solutions.

The cartilage-bone interface,"Caroline D Hoemann, Charles-Hubert Lafantaisie-Favreau, Viorica Lascau-Coman, Gaoping Chen, Jessica Guzmán-Morales",2012/6,Source The journal of knee surgery,"In the knee joint, the purpose of the cartilage-bone interface is to maintain structural integrity of the osteochondral unit during walking, kneeling, pivoting, and jumping–during which tensile, compressive, and shear forces are transmitted from the viscoelastic articular cartilage layer to the much stiffer mineralized end of the long bone. Mature articular cartilage is integrated with subchondral bone through a ~20 to ~250 µm thick layer of calcified cartilage. Inside the calcified cartilage layer, perpendicular chondrocyte-derived collagen type II fibers become structurally cemented to collagen type I osteoid deposited by osteoblasts. The mature mineralization front is delineated by a thin ~5 µm undulating tidemark structure that forms at the base of articular cartilage. Growth plate cartilage is anchored to epiphyseal bone, sometimes via a thin layer of calcified cartilage and tidemark, while the hypertrophic edge does not form a …",185

Actin microfilaments were present inside the cell membrane as a predominantly cortical structure. Vimentin and tubulin spanned the cytoplasm from cell to nuclear membrane, the vimentin network appearing finer compared to tubulin. These cytoskeletal structures were present in chondrocytes from all depth zones of the articular cartilage. However, staining intensity varied from zone to zone, usually showing more intense staining for the filament systems at the articular surface compared to the deeper zones.

Precise derivatization of structurally distinct chitosans with rhodamine B isothiocyanate,"Odette Ma, Marc Lavertu, Jun Sun, Sophie Nguyen, Michael D Buschmann, Françoise M Winnik, Caroline D Hoemann",2008/6/10,Journal Carbohydrate Polymers,"Work to date shows that structurally distinct chitosans have reacted inefficiently and unpredictably with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) in an acid–methanol solvent that maintains both chitosan and fluorophore solubility. Since isothiocyanate preferentially reacts with neutral amine groups, and chitosan solubility typically depends upon a minimal degree of protonation, we tested the hypothesis that precise derivatization of chitosan with rhodamine isothiocyanate (RITC) can be achieved by controlling the reaction time and the degree of protonation. Addition of 50% v/v methanol reduced the chitosan degree of protonation in acetic acid but not HCl solutions. At various degrees of protonation, chitosan reacted inefficiently with RITC as previously observed with FITC. Nevertheless, precise derivatization was achieved by allowing the reaction to proceed overnight at a given degree of protonation (p<0.0001, n=18) and …",95

Neutrophils exhibit distinct phenotypes toward chitosans with different degrees of deacetylation: implications for cartilage repair,"Pascale Simard, Hugo Galarneau, Sébastien Marois, Daniel Rusu, Caroline D Hoemann, Patrice E Poubelle, Hani El-Gabalawy, Maria JG Fernandes",2009/6,Journal Arthritis Research & Therapy,"Osteoarthritis is characterized by the progressive destruction of cartilage in the articular joints. Novel therapies that promote resurfacing of exposed bone in focal areas are of interest in osteoarthritis because they may delay the progression of this disabling disease in patients who develop focal lesions. Recently, the addition of 80% deacetylated chitosan to cartilage microfractures was shown to promote the regeneration of hyaline cartilage. The molecular mechanisms by which chitosan promotes cartilage regeneration remain unknown. Because neutrophils are transiently recruited to the microfracture site, the effect of 80% deacetylated chitosan on the function of neutrophils was investigated. Most studies on neutrophils use preparations of chitosan with an uncertain degree of deacetylation. For therapeutic purposes, it is of interest to determine whether the degree of deacetylation influences the response of neutrophils to chitosan. The effect of 95% deacetylated chitosan on the function of neutrophils was therefore also investigated and compared with that of 80% deacetylated chitosan. Human blood neutrophils from healthy donors were isolated by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque. Chemotaxis was performed using the chemoTX system. Production of superoxide anions was evaluated using the cytochrome c reduction assay. Degranulation was determined by evaluating the release of myeloperoxidase and lactoferrin. The internalization of fluorescently labelled 80% deacetylated chitosan by neutrophils was studied by confocal microscopy. Neutrophils were dose dependently attracted to 80% deacetylated chitosan.

We hypothesized that dispersed chitosan particles implanted close to the bone marrow degrade in situ in a molecular mass-dependent manner, and attract more stromal cells to the site in aged rabbits compared to the blood clot in untreated controls. Three microdrill hole defects, 1.4 mm diameter and 2 mm deep, were created in both knee trochlea of 30 month-old New Zealand White rabbits. Each of 3 isotonic chitosan solutions (150, 40, 10 kDa, 80% degree of deaceylation, with fluorescent chitosan tracer) was mixed with autologous rabbit whole blood, clotted with Tissue Factor to form cylindrical implants, and press-fit in drill holes in the left knee while contralateral holes received Tissue Factor or no treatment. At day 1 or day 21 post-operative, defects were analyzed by micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and stereology for bone and soft tissue repair. All 3 implants filled the top of defects at day 1 and were partly degraded in situ at 21 days post-operative. All implants attracted neutrophils, osteoclasts and abundant bone marrow-derived stromal cells, stimulated bone resorption followed by new woven bone repair (bone remodeling) and promoted repair tissue-bone integration. 150 kDa chitosan implant was less degraded, and elicited more apoptotic neutrophils and bone resorption than 10 kDa chitosan implant.

The polymer has a unique behavior of fluctuating between soluble chains at pH 6 and insoluble microparticles at pH 7. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that chitosan structure, solubility state, and serum influence the rate of cell uptake. Chitosans with 80% and 95% degree of deacetylation (medium and low viscosity) were tagged with rhodamine and analyzed for particle size, media solubility, and uptake by HEK293 epithelial cells using live confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. In media pH 7.4 with or without 10% serum, chitosans fully precipitated into 0.5 to 1.4 µm diameter microparticles with a slight negative charge. During 24 h of culture in serum-free medium, chitosan particles remained extracellular. In cultures with serum, particles were taken up into intracellular vesicles in a serum dose-dependent manner. Opsonization of chitosan with serum, or replacement of serum by epidermal growth factor (EGF) failed to mediate serum-free chitosan particle uptake. Serum stimulated cells to acidify the media, partly by lactate generation. Media acidified to pH 6.5 by 7 mM lactate maintained 50% of chitosan in the soluble fraction, and led to minor uniform serum-free uptake in small vesicles. Conclusion: Media acidification mediates minor in vitro uptake of non-biofouled soluble chitosan chains, while serum-biofouled insoluble chitosan microparticles require sustained serum exposure to generate energy required for macropinocytosis.",28

A similarity between morphology of chondrocytes within degenerate cartilage and those cultured in a weak 3D matrix,"PG Bush, CD Hoemann, AC Hall",2001/2,"Journal Proceedings of the 47th Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research Society, San Francisco, CA, USA","Discussion: There was a similarity between the abnormal morphology of cells previously reported in degenerate human articular cartilage in situ, and that of chondrocytes cultured in a weak 3D matrix. The cells cultured in agarose also showed a larger volume. This might suggest that chondrocytes were simply expanding into the defects afforded by a weaker gel. However, the time scale might indicate more complex behaviour, since abnormal cells did not appear for at least 10 days. It is conceivable that degradation of the gels occurred in culture, with the possibility that even stiffer gels will contain abnormal cells if left long enough. Previous studies using alginate suggest there is a reduction in gel strength occurring within 15hrs but with no further change for up to 7days (7). However, chondrocytes have been cultured for up to 8mths with no reported abnormal morphology (6). Similarly chondrocytes in agarose have been cultured for 47days with no reported effect (5). Changes to cell volume/morphology, which we have observed in degenerate human cartilage, could result in alterations to cell metabolism. We have shown similar changes in chondrocytes cultured in weak 3D alginate/agarose gels. These changes in chondrocyte volume/morphology in weakened gels might provide a controlled protocol for studying the effects of chondrocyte volume/morphology on matrix metabolism and also comparison with the morphological changes of chondrocytes within degenerate cartilage.

Buschmann+ Ecole Polytechnique, Montreal QC Canada caroline. hoemann@ polymtl. ca ABSTRACT: The blood clot is the physical basis for all wound repair, including recruitment of inflammatory and repair cells. Surgical techniques to form a clot at the base of a cartilage lesion have been developed, in order to draw multipotential mesenchymal repair cells from the marrow into the defect. However, bone marrow-derived repair cells most frequently adopt a fibroblast phenotype. We have recently shown that a pH-neutral chitosan solution (Chitosan-GP, or C-GP), could be mixed into whole blood to form a stabilized clot inside a microfractured cartilage lesion in sheep, resulting in more hyaline repair cartilage than microfracture alone [1]. Here we present key in vitro properties of liquid C-GP mixed with whole blood from human, sheep, or rabbit. A bilateral rabbit articular cartilage repair model was developed in order to compare repair in defects after marrow stimulation with C-GP/blood implants, versus marrow stimulation alone. We hypothesized that removing the calcified layer in rabbit defects could improve the repair outcome. Defects in each group had the calcified layer retained (n= 4), or removed (n= 4). Repair was analyzed after 3 weeks or 7 to 11 weeks post-surgery. Collective results indicated that the best hyaline repair resulted in defects that retained the calcified layer and were treated with C-GP/blood implant.

Compared to serum-free medium, FLS treated with PDGF showed 3-fold higher UGDH activity and 6-fold higher HA release, but IL-1beta/TGF-beta1 induced 27-fold higher HA release without enhancing UGDH activity. In selected proliferating cells, UGDH activity was lost in the cytosol, but preserved in the nucleus. Cell-free assays led us to discover that diaphorase, a cytosolic enzyme, or glutathione reductase, a nuclear enzyme, was necessary and sufficient for NADH to reduce NBT to a blue formazan dye in a 1-hour timeframe.

We investigated the ability of an electromechanical probe and an automated indentation technique to characterize entire human articular surfaces for rapid non-destructive discrimination between early degenerated and healthy articular cartilage. Human cadaveric asymptomatic articular surfaces (4 pairs of distal femurs and 4 pairs of tibial plateaus) were used. They were assessed ex vivo: macroscopically, electromechanically (maps of the electromechanical quantitative parameter, QP, reflecting streaming potentials), mechanically (maps of the instantaneous modulus, IM) and through cartilage thickness. Osteochondral cores were also harvested from healthy and degenerated regions for histological assessment, biochemical analyses and unconfined compression tests. The macroscopic visual assessment delimited three distinct regions on each articular surface: region I was macroscopically degenerated, region II was macroscopically normal but adjacent to region I and region III was the remaining normal articular surface. Thus, each extracted core was assigned to one of the three regions. A mixed effect model revealed that only the QP (p< 0.0001) and IM (p< 0.0001) were able to statistically discriminate the three regions. Effect size was higher for QP and IM than other assessments, indicating greater sensitivity to distinguish early degeneration of cartilage.

Thromboelastography cups and pins for improved blood coagulation testing: Surface modification by plasma coating,"Angel Contreras-García, Caroline D Hoemann, Michael R Wertheimer",Orléans-France,Pages 44,"One of the current challenges to render the performance of bio-technologies such as thromboelastography (TEG) more reliable is the development of new materials; in the case of TEG, control of the coagulation properties of anticoagulated blood plasma and unmodified whole blood are currently not satisfactory. Plastic cups used to hold the blood sample being analyzed are made of “Cyrolite”, a type of methacrylate, in which the clotting processes starting between 15 to 60 min are uncontrollable. The contact coagulation pathway can be triggered by selective adsorption of Factor XII to negatively charged surfaces, such as silicates, which alters the protein conformation to expose a serine protease active site. We began with the hypothesis that surface-modification of TEG cups and pins will change the coagulation behavior of recalcified, citrated human blood plasma and of unmodified human whole blood: The presence of (positively-charged) amine groups should inhibit clotting, while (negatively-charged) carboxylate (-COO-) groups should accelerate it [1, 2]. Therefore, surfaces of TEG cups and pins were modified so as to change their properties, for example their surface chemistry and free-energy, and thereby to promote reproducible, rapid clotting time. This is being examined by using four different types of glow-discharge plasma deposits:(i)“low-pressure N-containing plasma-polyethylene”(L-PPE: N), rich in primary amine groups [3];(ii) its O-containing counterpart (L-PPE: O) with COO-groups;(iii) plasmapolymerized hexamethyldisiloxane (PP-HMDSO), to create a hydrophobic surface [4]; and (iv) silica (SiO2, glass-like coating) from a HMDSO …",
