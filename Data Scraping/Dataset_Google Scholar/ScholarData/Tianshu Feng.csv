Improving Federated Learning Face Recognition via Privacy-Agnostic Clusters,"Qiang Meng, Feng Zhou, Hainan Ren, Tianshu Feng, Guochao Liu, Yuanqing Lin",2022/1/29,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.12467,"The growing public concerns on data privacy in face recognition can be greatly addressed by the federated learning (FL) paradigm. However, conventional FL methods perform poorly due to the uniqueness of the task: broadcasting class centers among clients is crucial for recognition performances but leads to privacy leakage. To resolve the privacy-utility paradox, this work proposes PrivacyFace, a framework largely improves the federated learning face recognition via communicating auxiliary and privacy-agnostic information among clients. PrivacyFace mainly consists of two components: First, a practical Differentially Private Local Clustering (DPLC) mechanism is proposed to distill sanitized clusters from local class centers. Second, a consensus-aware recognition loss subsequently encourages global consensuses among clients, which ergo results in more discriminative features. The proposed framework is mathematically proved to be differentially private, introducing a lightweight overhead as well as yielding prominent performance boosts (\textit{e.g.}, +9.63\% and +10.26\% for TAR@FAR=1e-4 on IJB-B and IJB-C respectively). Extensive experiments and ablation studies on a large-scale dataset have demonstrated the efficacy and practicability of our method.",11
Semi-supervised topological analysis for elucidating hidden structures in high-dimensional Transcriptome datasets,"Tianshu Feng, Jaime I Davila, Yuanhang Liu, Sangdi Lin, Shuai Huang, Chen Wang",2019/10/31,Journal IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,"Topological data analysis (TDA) is a powerful method for reducing data dimensionality, mining underlying data relationships, and intuitively representing the data structure. The Mapper algorithm is one such tool that projects high-dimensional data to 1-dimensional space by using a filter function that is subsequently used to reconstruct the data topology relationships. However, domain context information and prior knowledge have not been considered in current TDA modeling frameworks. Here, we report the development and evaluation of a semi-supervised topological analysis (STA) framework that incorporates discrete or continuously labeled data points and selects the most relevant filter functions accordingly. We validate the proposed STA framework with simulation data and then apply it to samples from Genotype-Tissue Expression data and ovarian cancer transcriptome datasets. The graphs generated by …",4
Improving ESVM with Generalized Cross-Validation,"Tianshu Feng, Fuzhen Zhuang, Qing He",2015/7/12,Conference 2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),"ELM works for the “generalized” singlehidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) but the hidden layer (or called feature mapping) in ELM needs not be tuned. Extreme Support Vector Machine (ESVM), combining Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) kernels, can lead to a better prediction capability. ESVM can usually have a relatively good predictive capability, and its training time is shorter than SVM most of the time. However, the estimation of regularization parameter of ESVM is very time-consuming. Moreover, the effects of the variance of hidden layer weights and the number of hidden neurons on ESVM are still unclear. Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) has been widely used in statistics because it can efficiently estimate the ridge parameter without estimating the variance of errors. In this work, we study a connection between ESVM and GCV. Specifically, we consider the …",4
Explaining Adverse Actions in Credit Decisions Using Shapley Decomposition,"Vijayan N Nair, Tianshu Feng, Linwei Hu, Zach Zhang, Jie Chen, Agus Sudjianto",2022/4/26,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.12365,"When a financial institution declines an application for credit, an adverse action (AA) is said to occur. The applicant is then entitled to an explanation for the negative decision. This paper focuses on credit decisions based on a predictive model for probability of default and proposes a methodology for AA explanation. The problem involves identifying the important predictors responsible for the negative decision and is straightforward when the underlying model is additive. However, it becomes non-trivial even for linear models with interactions. We consider models with low-order interactions and develop a simple and intuitive approach based on first principles. We then show how the methodology generalizes to the well-known Shapely decomposition and the recently proposed concept of Baseline Shapley (B-Shap). Unlike other Shapley techniques in the literature for local interpretability of machine learning results, B-Shap is computationally tractable since it involves just function evaluations. An illustrative case study is used to demonstrate the usefulness of the method. The paper also discusses situations with highly correlated predictors and desirable properties of fitted models in the credit-lending context, such as monotonicity and continuity.",1
Dynamic Inspection of Latent Variables in State-Space Systems,"Tianshu Feng, Xiaoning Qian, Kaibo Liu, Shuai Huang",2019/1/7,Journal IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,"The state-space models (SSMs) are widely used in a variety of areas where a set of observable variables are used to track some latent variables. While most existing works focus on the statistical modeling of the relationship between the latent variables and observable variables or statistical inferences of the latent variables based on the observable variables, it comes to our awareness that an important problem has been largely neglected. In many applications, although the latent variables cannot be routinely acquired, they can be occasionally acquired to enhance the monitoring of the state-space system. Therefore, in this paper, novel dynamic inspection (DI) methods under a general framework of SSMs are developed to identify and inspect the latent variables that are most uncertain. Extensive numeric studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",1
"Festival, Date and Limit Line: Predicting Vehicle Accident Rate in Beijing","Xinyu Wu, Ping Luo, Qing He, Tianshu Feng, Fuzhen Zhuang",2015/6/30,Book Proceedings of the 2015 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining,"Thousands of vehicle accidents happen every day in Beijing, leading to huge losses. Government traffic management bureau, hospitals, and insurance companies put massive manpower and material resources to deal with accidents. For more reasonable resource assignment, in this study we focus on the prediction of daily Vehicle Accident Rate (VAR), namely the percentage of vehicles with accidents. Specifically, we analyze how the variation of VAR correlates with the macroscopic features, like Chinese festival, date, tail-number limit line etc., and develop the prediction model for VAR based on these features. Our analysis is based on the records of two-year accidents on the vehicles, which are insured by a local insurance giant in Beijing. Experiments show that the proposed model can predict the long-term VAR for at least three months in advance, with satisfactory results. Note also that our study is based on …",1
Comparing Baseline Shapley and Integrated Gradients for Local Explanation: Some Additional Insights,"Tianshu Feng, Zhipu Zhou, Joshi Tarun, Vijayan N Nair",2022/8/12,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.06096,"There are many different methods in the literature for local explanation of machine learning results. However, the methods differ in their approaches and often do not provide same explanations. In this paper, we consider two recent methods: Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan, Taly, & Yan, 2017) and Baseline Shapley (Sundararajan and Najmi, 2020). The original authors have already studied the axiomatic properties of the two methods and provided some comparisons. Our work provides some additional insights on their comparative behavior for tabular data. We discuss common situations where the two provide identical explanations and where they differ. We also use simulation studies to examine the differences when neural networks with ReLU activation function is used to fit the models.",
Sparse group regularization for semi‐continuous transportation data,"Tianshu Feng, Linda Ng Boyle",2021/6/30,Journal Statistics in Medicine,"Motor vehicle crashes are a global public health concern. Most analysis have used zero‐inflated count models for examining crash counts. However, few methods are available to account for safety metrics that have semi‐continuous observations. This article considers the problem of variable selection for the semi‐continuous zero‐inflated (SCZI) models. These models include two parts: a zero‐inflated part and a nonzero continuous part. A special group regularization is designed to accommodate the unique structure of two‐part SCZI models, and a type of Bayesian information criterion is proposed to select tuning parameters. We illustrate the variable selection process of the proposed model using lane position data from a driving simulator study. In the study, drivers stay in the intended lane for the majority of their drive (zero‐inflated part). On occasion, some drivers do drift out of their intended driving lane (nonzero …",
Zero-Inflated Models for Semi-Continuous Transportation Data,Tianshu Feng,2020,Institution University of Washington,"Zero-inflated models have been widely studied and are commonly used in the transportation safety area. Despite the success of zero-inflated models to analyze static data with counting outcomes, challenges remain in the examination of zero-inflated data with semi-continuous and auto-correlated longitudinal outcomes. This dissertation aims to explore different approaches to tackle the existing challenges in semi-continuous zero-inflated data analysis. The dissertation begins with a discussion of challenges with existing zero-inflated models in modelling semi-continuous data and time-series data. Then, our recent works on a variable selection method for semi-continuous zero-inflated models and a dynamic model for semi-continuous zero-inflated time-series data are presented. Simulated data was used to validate the proposed models. And finally, we demonstrate the proposed models using two different …",
