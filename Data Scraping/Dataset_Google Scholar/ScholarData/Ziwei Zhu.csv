Fairness-aware tensor-based recommendation,"Ziwei Zhu, Xia Hu, James Caverlee",2018/10/17,Book Proceedings of the 27th ACM international conference on information and knowledge management,"Tensor-based methods have shown promise in improving upon traditional matrix factorization methods for recommender systems. But tensors may achieve improved recommendation quality while worsening the fairness of the recommendations. Hence, we propose a novel fairness-aware tensor recommendation framework that is designed to maintain quality while dramatically improving fairness. Four key aspects of the proposed framework are: (i) a new sensitive latent factor matrix for isolating sensitive features; (ii) a sensitive information regularizer that extracts sensitive information which can taint other latent factors; (iii) an effective algorithm to solve the proposed optimization model; and (iv) extension to multi-feature and multi-category cases which previous efforts have not addressed. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show that the framework enhances recommendation fairness while …",131
Measuring and mitigating item under-recommendation bias in personalized ranking systems,"Ziwei Zhu, Jianling Wang, James Caverlee",2020/7/25,Book Proceedings of the 43rd international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval,"Recommendation algorithms typically build models based on user-item interactions (e.g., clicks, likes, or ratings) to provide a personalized ranked list of items. These interactions are often distributed unevenly over different groups of items due to varying user preferences. However, we show that recommendation algorithms can inherit or even amplify this imbalanced distribution, leading to item under-recommendation bias. Concretely, we formalize the concepts of ranking-based statistical parity and equal opportunity as two measures of item under-recommendation bias. Then, we empirically show that one of the most widely adopted algorithms -- Bayesian Personalized Ranking -- produces biased recommendations, which motivates our effort to propose the novel debiased personalized ranking model. The debiased model is able to improve the two proposed bias metrics while preserving recommendation …",60
"Infusing disease knowledge into BERT for health question answering, medical inference and disease name recognition","Yun He, Ziwei Zhu, Yin Zhang, Qin Chen, James Caverlee",2020/10/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.03746,"Knowledge of a disease includes information of various aspects of the disease, such as signs and symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. This disease knowledge is critical for many health-related and biomedical tasks, including consumer health question answering, medical language inference and disease name recognition. While pre-trained language models like BERT have shown success in capturing syntactic, semantic, and world knowledge from text, we find they can be further complemented by specific information like knowledge of symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and other disease aspects. Hence, we integrate BERT with disease knowledge for improving these important tasks. Specifically, we propose a new disease knowledge infusion training procedure and evaluate it on a suite of BERT models including BERT, BioBERT, SciBERT, ClinicalBERT, BlueBERT, and ALBERT. Experiments over the three tasks show that these models can be enhanced in nearly all cases, demonstrating the viability of disease knowledge infusion. For example, accuracy of BioBERT on consumer health question answering is improved from 68.29% to 72.09%, while new SOTA results are observed in two datasets. We make our data and code freely available.",55
Popularity-opportunity bias in collaborative filtering,"Ziwei Zhu, Yun He, Xing Zhao, Yin Zhang, Jianling Wang, James Caverlee",2021/3/8,Book Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,"This paper connects equal opportunity to popularity bias in implicit recommenders to introduce the problem of popularity-opportunity bias. That is, conditioned on user preferences that a user likes both items, the more popular item is more likely to be recommended (or ranked higher) to the user than the less popular one. This type of bias is harmful, exerting negative effects on the engagement of both users and item providers. Thus, we conduct a three-part study: (i) By a comprehensive empirical study, we identify the existence of the popularity-opportunity bias in fundamental matrix factorization models on four datasets; (ii) coupled with this empirical study, our theoretical study shows that matrix factorization models inherently produce the bias; and (iii) we demonstrate the potential of alleviating this bias by both in-processing and post-processing algorithms. Extensive experiments on four datasets show the effective …",48
Improving top-k recommendation via jointcollaborative autoencoders,"Ziwei Zhu, Jianling Wang, James Caverlee",2019/5/13,Book The World Wide Web Conference,"In this paper, we propose a Joint Collaborative Autoencoder framework that learns both user-user and item-item correlations simultaneously, leading to a more robust model and improved top-K recommendation performance. More specifically, we show how to model these user-item correlations and demonstrate the importance of careful normalization to alleviate the influence of feedback heterogeneity. Further, we adopt a pairwise hinge-based objective function to maximize the top-K precision and recall directly for top-K recommenders. Finally, a mini-batch optimization algorithm is proposed to train the proposed model. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art non-neural and neural alternatives. ",40
Session-based recommendation with hypergraph attention networks,"Jianling Wang, Kaize Ding, Ziwei Zhu, James Caverlee",2021,Book Proceedings of the 2021 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM),"Session-based recommender systems aim to improve recommendations in short-term sessions that can be found across many platforms. A critical challenge is to accurately model user intent with only limited evidence in these short sessions. For example, is a flower bouquet being viewed meant as part of a wedding purchase or for home decoration? Such different perspectives greatly impact what should be recommended next. Hence, this paper proposes a novel session-based recommendation system empowered by hypergraph attention networks. Three unique properties of the proposed approach are: (i) it constructs a hypergraph for each session to model the item correlations defined by various contextual windows in the session simultaneously, to uncover item meanings; (ii) it is equipped with hypergraph attention layers to generate item embeddings by flexibly aggregating the contextual information from …",34
Recommendation for new users and new items via randomized training and mixture-of-experts transformation,"Ziwei Zhu, Shahin Sefati, Parsa Saadatpanah, James Caverlee",2020/7/25,Book Proceedings of the 43rd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,"The cold start problem is a long-standing challenge in recommender systems. That is, how to recommend for new users and new items without any historical interaction record? Recent ML-based approaches have made promising strides versus traditional methods. These ML approaches typically combine both user-item interaction data of existing warm start users and items (as in CF-based methods) with auxiliary information of users and items such as user profiles and item content information (as in content-based methods). However, such approaches face key drawbacks including the error superimposition issue that the auxiliary-to-CF transformation error increases the final recommendation error; the ineffective learning issue that long distance from transformation functions to model output layer leads to ineffective model learning; and the unified transformation issue that applying the same transformation function …",30
Content-collaborative disentanglement representation learning for enhanced recommendation,"Yin Zhang, Ziwei Zhu, Yun He, James Caverlee",2020/9/22,Book Proceedings of the 14th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems," Modern recommenders usually consider both collaborative features from user behavior data (e.g., clicks) and content information about the users and items (e.g., user ages or item images) for improved recommendations. While encouraging, the uncovered user preference representations derived from these collaborative and content-based perspectives can be entangled by intermixing the influence from each other, leading to sub-optimal performance and unstable recommendations. Hence, we propose to disentangle representations learned from user behavior data and content information. Specifically, we propose a novel two-level disentanglement generative recommendation model (DICER) that supports both content-collaborative disentanglement and feature disentanglement: for the content-collaborative disentanglement, DICER decomposes the features by their marginal distributions based on content and …",24
Modeling and detecting student attention and interest level using wearable computers,"Ziwei Zhu, Sebastian Ober, Roozbeh Jafari",2017/5/9,Conference 2017 IEEE 14th international conference on wearable and implantable body sensor networks (BSN),"The cognitive states of students in a lecture can give good indications of student concentration and learning, and therefore, modeling them would have a positive impact on their quality of education by enabling the intervention of instructors. In a traditional class, the instructor would assess the students' level of attention. However, the assessment may not be accurate for a variety of reasons. Additionally, this creates a burden for the instructors. Wearable sensors and signal processing techniques could provide opportunities to assist teachers with this assessment. In this paper, we propose a methodology to model students' cognitive states by leveraging hand motion and heart activity captured with smart watches. Following the application of a sequence of signal processing techniques to the raw data, we generate features, which describe characteristics of the hand motion and heart activity in a group of students.

Popularity bias in dynamic recommendation,"Ziwei Zhu, Yun He, Xing Zhao, James Caverlee",2021/8/14,Book Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining,"Popularity bias is a long-standing challenge in recommender systems: popular items are overly recommended at the expense of less popular items that users may be interested in being under-recommended. Such a bias exerts detrimental impact on both users and item providers, and many efforts have been dedicated to studying and solving such a bias. However, most existing works situate the popularity bias in a static setting, where the bias is analyzed only for a single round of recommendation with logged data. These works fail to take account of the dynamic nature of real-world recommendation process, leaving several important research questions unanswered: how does the popularity bias evolve in a dynamic scenario? what are the impacts of unique factors in a dynamic recommendation process on the bias? and how to debias in this long-term dynamic process? In this work, we investigate the popularity …",21
Unbiased implicit recommendation and propensity estimation via combinational joint learning,"Ziwei Zhu, Yun He, Yin Zhang, James Caverlee",2020/9/22,Book Proceedings of the 14th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems," This paper focuses on how to generate unbiased recommendations based on biased implicit user-item interactions. We propose a combinational joint learning framework to simultaneously learn unbiased user-item relevance and unbiased propensity. More specifically, we first present a new unbiased objective function for estimating propensity. We then show how a naïve joint learning approach faces an estimation-training overlap problem. Hence, we propose to jointly train multiple sub-models from different parts of the training dataset to avoid this problem. Finally, we show how to incorporate residual components trained by the complete training data to complement the relevance and propensity sub-models. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model with an improvement of 4% on average over the best alternatives.",21
Fairness among new items in cold start recommender systems,"Ziwei Zhu, Jingu Kim, Trung Nguyen, Aish Fenton, James Caverlee",2021/7/11,Book Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,"This paper investigates recommendation fairness among new items. While previous efforts have studied fairness in recommender systems and shown success in improving fairness, they mainly focus on scenarios where unfairness arises due to biased prior user-feedback history (like clicks or views). Yet, it is unknown whether new items without any feedback history can be recommended fairly, and if unfairness does exist, how can we provide fair recommendations among these new items in such a cold-start scenario. In detail, we first formalize fairness among new items with the well-known concepts of equal opportunity and Rawlsian Max-Min fairness. We empirically show the prevalence of unfairness in cold start recommender systems. Then we propose a novel learnable post-processing framework as a model blueprint for enhancing fairness, with which we propose two concrete models: a joint-learning …",16
Key opinion leaders in recommendation systems: Opinion elicitation and diffusion,"Jianling Wang, Kaize Ding, Ziwei Zhu, Yin Zhang, James Caverlee",2020/1/20,Book Proceedings of the 13th international conference on web search and data mining,"Recommendation systems typically rely on the interactions between a crowd of ordinary users and items, ignoring the fact that many real-world communities are notably influenced by a small group of key opinion leaders, whose feedback on items wields outsize influence. With important positions in the community (e.g. have a large number of followers), their elite opinions are able to diffuse to the community and further impact what items we buy, what media we consume, and how we interact with online platforms. Hence, this paper investigates how to develop a novel recommendation system by explicitly capturing the influence from key opinion leaders to the whole community. Centering around opinion elicitation and diffusion, we propose an end-to-end Graph-based neural model - GoRec. Specifically, to preserve the multi-relations between key opinion leaders and items, GoRec elicits the opinions from key …",16
Improving the estimation of tail ratings in recommender system with multi-latent representations,"Xing Zhao, Ziwei Zhu, Yin Zhang, James Caverlee",2020/1/20,Book Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,"The importance of the distribution of ratings on recommender systems (RS) is well-recognized. And yet, recommendation approaches based on latent factor models and recently introduced neural variants (e.g., NCF) optimize for the head of these distributions, potentially leading to large estimation errors for tail ratings. These errors in tail ratings that are far from the mean predicted rating fall out of a uni-modal assumption underlying these popular models, as we show in this paper. We propose to improve the estimation of tail ratings by extending traditional single latent representations (e.g., an item is represented by a single latent vector) with new multi-latent representations for better modeling these tail ratings. We show how to incorporate these multi-latent representations in an end-to-end neural prediction model that is designed to better reflect the underlying ratings distributions of items. Through experiments over …",10
Rabbit holes and taste distortion: Distribution-aware recommendation with evolving interests,"Xing Zhao, Ziwei Zhu, James Caverlee",2021/4/19,Book Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021," To mitigate the rabbit hole effect in recommendations, conventional distribution-aware recommendation systems aim to ensure that a user’s prior interest areas are reflected in the recommendations that the system makes. For example, a user who historically prefers comedies to dramas by 2:1 should see a similar ratio in recommended movies. Such approaches have proven to be an important building block for recommendation tasks. However, existing distribution-aware approaches enforce that the target taste distribution should exactly match a user’s prior interests (typically revealed through training data), based on the assumption that users’ taste distribution is fundamentally static. This assumption can lead to large estimation errors. We empirically identify this taste distortion problem through a data-driven study over multiple datasets. We show how taste preferences dynamically shift and how the design of a …",8
User recommendation in content curation platforms,"Jianling Wang, Ziwei Zhu, James Caverlee",2020/1/20,Book Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,"We propose a personalized user recommendation framework for content curation platforms that models preferences for both users and the items they engage with simultaneously. In this way, user preferences for specific item types (e.g., fantasy novels) can be balanced with user specialties (e.g., reviewing novels with strong female protagonists). In particular, the proposed model has three unique characteristics: (i) it simultaneously learns both user-item and user-user preferences through a multi-aspect autoencoder model; (ii) it fuses the latent representations of user preferences on users and items to construct shared factors through an adversarial framework; and (iii) it incorporates an attention layer to produce weighted aggregations of different latent representations, leading to improved personalized recommendation of users and items. Through experiments against state-of-the-art models, we find the proposed …",7
Pseudo-implicit feedback for alleviating data sparsity in top-k recommendation,"Yun He, Haochen Chen, Ziwei Zhu, James Caverlee",2018/11/17,Conference 2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),"We propose PsiRec, a novel user preference propagation recommender that incorporates pseudo-implicit feedback for enriching the original sparse implicit feedback dataset. Three of the unique characteristics of PsiRec are: (i) it views user-item interactions as a bipartite graph and models pseudo-implicit feedback from this perspective; (ii) its random walks-based approach extracts graph structure information from this bipartite graph, toward estimating pseudo-implicit feedback; and (iii) it adopts a Skip-gram inspired measure of confidence in pseudo-implicit feedback that captures the pointwise mutual information between users and items. This pseudo-implicit feedback is ultimately incorporated into a new latent factor model to estimate user preference in cases of extreme sparsity. PsiRec results in improvements of 21.5% and 22.7% in terms of Precision@10 and Recall@10 over state-of-the-art Collaborative …",7
Quantifying and mitigating popularity bias in conversational recommender systems,"Allen Lin, Jianling Wang, Ziwei Zhu, James Caverlee",2022/10/17,Book Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management,"Conversational recommender systems (CRS) have shown great success in accurately capturing a user's current and detailed preference through the multi-round interaction cycle while effectively guiding users to a more personalized recommendation. Perhaps surprisingly, conversational recommender systems can be plagued by popularity bias, much like traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we systematically study the problem of popularity bias in CRSs. We demonstrate the existence of popularity bias in existing state-of-the-art CRSs from an exposure rate, a success rate, and a conversational utility perspective, and propose a suite of popularity bias metrics designed specifically for the CRS setting. We then introduce a debiasing framework with three unique features: (i) Popularity-Aware Focused Learning, to reduce the popularity-distorting impact on preference prediction; (ii) Cold-Start Item …",6

End-to-end learning for fair ranking systems,"James Kotary, Ferdinando Fioretto, Pascal Van Hentenryck, Ziwei Zhu",2022/4/25,Book Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022," The learning-to-rank problem aims at ranking items to maximize exposure of those most relevant to a user query. A desirable property of such ranking systems is to guarantee some notion of fairness among specified item groups. While fairness has recently been considered in the context of learning-to-rank systems, current methods cannot provide guarantees on the fairness of the predicted rankings. This paper addresses this gap and introduces Smart Predict and Optimize for Fair Ranking (SPOFR), an integrated optimization and learning framework for fairness-constrained learning to rank. The end-to-end SPOFR framework includes a constrained optimization sub-model and produces ranking policies that are guaranteed to satisfy fairness constraints, while allowing for fine control of the fairness-utility tradeoff. SPOFR is shown to significantly improve on current state-of-the-art fair learning-to-rank systems with …",4
Addressing the target customer distortion problem in recommender systems,"Xing Zhao, Ziwei Zhu, Majid Alfifi, James Caverlee",2020/4/20,Book Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020,"Predicting the potential target customers for a product is essential. However, traditional recommender systems typically aim to optimize an engagement metric without considering the overall distribution of target customers, thereby leading to serious distortion problems. In this paper, we conduct a data-driven study to reveal several distortions that arise from conventional recommenders. Toward overcoming these issues, we propose a target customer re-ranking algorithm to adjust the population distribution and composition in the Top-k target customers of an item while maintaining recommendation quality. By applying this proposed algorithm onto a real-world dataset, we find the proposed method can effectively make the class distribution of items’ target customers close to the desired distribution, thereby mitigating distortion.",4
Towards Fair Conversational Recommender Systems,"Shuo Lin, Ziwei Zhu, Jianling Wang, James Caverlee",2022/8/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.03854,"Conversational recommender systems have demonstrated great success. They can accurately capture a user's current detailed preference - through a multi-round interaction cycle - to effectively guide users to a more personalized recommendation. Alas, conversational recommender systems can be plagued by the adverse effects of bias, much like traditional recommenders. In this work, we argue for increased attention on the presence of and methods for counteracting bias in these emerging systems. As a starting point, we propose three fundamental questions that should be deeply examined to enable fairness in conversational recommender systems.",2
Fighting mainstream bias in recommender systems via local fine tuning,"Ziwei Zhu, James Caverlee",2022/2/11,Book Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,"In collaborative filtering, the quality of recommendations critically relies on how easily a model can find similar users for a target user. Hence, a niche user who prefers items out of the mainstream may receive poor recommendations, while a mainstream user sharing interests with many others will likely receive recommendations of higher quality. In this work, we study this mainstream bias centering around three key thrusts. First, to distinguish mainstream and niche users, we explore four approaches based on outlier detection techniques to identify a mainstream score indicating the mainstream level for each user. Second, we empirically show that severe mainstream bias is produced by conventional recommendation models. Last, we explore both global and local methods to mitigate the bias. Concretely, we propose two global models: Distribution Calibration (DC) and Weighted Loss (WL) methods; and one local …",2
Enhancing User Personalization in Conversational Recommenders,"Allen Lin, Ziwei Zhu, Jianling Wang, James Caverlee",2023/2/13,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.06656,"Conversational recommenders are emerging as a powerful tool to personalize a user's recommendation experience. Through a back-and-forth dialogue, users can quickly hone in on just the right items. Many approaches to conversational recommendation, however, only partially explore the user preference space and make limiting assumptions about how user feedback can be best incorporated, resulting in long dialogues and poor recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel conversational recommendation framework with two unique features: (i) a greedy NDCG attribute selector, to enhance user personalization in the interactive preference elicitation process by prioritizing attributes that most effectively represent the actual preference space of the user; and (ii) a user representation refiner, to effectively fuse together the user preferences collected from the interactive elicitation process to obtain a more personalized understanding of the user. Through extensive experiments on four frequently used datasets, we find the proposed framework not only outperforms all the state-of-the-art conversational recommenders (in terms of both recommendation performance and conversation efficiency), but also provides a more personalized experience for the user under the proposed multi-groundtruth multi-round conversational recommendation setting.",1
Evolution of Filter Bubbles and Polarization in News Recommendation,"Han Zhang, Ziwei Zhu, James Caverlee",2023/1/26,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10926,"Recent work in news recommendation has demonstrated that recommenders can over-expose users to articles that support their pre-existing opinions. However, most existing work focuses on a static setting or over a short-time window, leaving open questions about the long-term and dynamic impacts of news recommendations. In this paper, we explore these dynamic impacts through a systematic study of three research questions: 1) How do the news reading behaviors of users change after repeated long-term interactions with recommenders? 2) How do the inherent preferences of users change over time in such a dynamic recommender system? 3) Can the existing SOTA static method alleviate the problem in the dynamic environment? Concretely, we conduct a comprehensive data-driven study through simulation experiments of political polarization in news recommendations based on 40,000 annotated news articles. We find that users are rapidly exposed to more extreme content as the recommender evolves. We also find that a calibration-based intervention can slow down this polarization, but leaves open significant opportunities for future improvements",
