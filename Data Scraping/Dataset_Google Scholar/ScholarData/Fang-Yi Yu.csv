General threshold model for social cascades: Analysis and simulations,"Jie Gao, Golnaz Ghasemiesfeh, Grant Schoenebeck, Fang-Yi Yu",2016/7/21,Book Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation,Social behaviors and choices spread through interactions and may lead to a cascading behavior. Understanding how such social cascades spread in a network is crucial for many applications ranging from viral marketing to political campaigns. The behavior of cascade depends crucially on the model of cascade or social influence and the topological structure of the social network.,18
Information elicitation mechanisms for statistical estimation,"Yuqing Kong, Grant Schoenebeck, Biaoshuai Tao, Fang-Yi Yu",2020/4/3,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"We study learning statistical properties from strategic agents with private information. In this problem, agents must be incentivized to truthfully reveal their information even when it cannot be directly verified. Moreover, the information reported by the agents must be aggregated into a statistical estimate.

The volatility of weak ties: Co-evolution of selection and influence in social networks,"Jie Gao, Grant Schoenebeck, Fang-Yi Yu",2019/5/8,Book Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems,"Social ties are not static, they evolve over time and the evolution is driven by two processes. One is selection where an individual may seek out and form new ties; often with others that have similar attributes [31]. The other social process is influence in which two individuals already connected by a social tie may influence one another and converge on their personal attributes (interest, tastes, etc)[28, 32]. Both of them result in neighboring nodes being more similar than two random nodes.",13

Multi-agent performative prediction: From global stability and optimality to chaos,"Georgios Piliouras, Fang-Yi Yu",2022/1/25,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.10483,"The recent framework of performative prediction is aimed at capturing settings where predictions influence the target/outcome they want to predict. In this paper, we introduce a natural multi-agent version of this framework, where multiple decision makers try to predict the same outcome. We showcase that such competition can result in interesting phenomena by proving the possibility of phase transitions from stability to instability and eventually chaos. Specifically, we present settings of multi-agent performative prediction where under sufficient conditions their dynamics lead to global stability and optimality. In the opposite direction, when the agents are not sufficiently cautious in their learning/updates rates, we show that instability and in fact formal chaos is possible. We complement our theoretical predictions with simulations showcasing the predictive power of our results.",7
Learning and Strongly Truthful Multi-Task Peer Prediction: A Variational Approach,"Grant Schoenebeck, Fang-Yi Yu",2021,Conference 12th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference (ITCS 2021),"Peer prediction mechanisms incentivize agents to truthfully report their signals even in the absence of verification by comparing agents' reports with those of their peers. In the detail-free multi-task setting, agents respond to multiple independent and identically distributed tasks, and the mechanism does not know the prior distribution of agents' signals. The goal is to provide an -strongly truthful mechanism where truth-telling rewards agents ""strictly"" more than any other strategy profile (with  additive error), and to do so while requiring as few tasks as possible. We design a family of mechanisms with a scoring function that maps a pair of reports to a score. The mechanism is strongly truthful if the scoring function is ""prior ideal,"" and -strongly truthful as long as the scoring function is sufficiently close to the ideal one. This reduces the above mechanism design problem to a learning problem -- specifically learning an ideal scoring function. We leverage this reduction to obtain the following three results. 1) We show how to derive good bounds on the number of tasks required for different types of priors. Our reduction applies to myriad continuous signal space settings. This is the first peer-prediction mechanism on continuous signals designed for the multi-task setting. 2) We show how to turn a soft-predictor of an agent's signals (given the other agents' signals) into a mechanism. This allows the practical use of machine learning algorithms that give good results even when many agents provide noisy information. 3) For finite signal spaces, we obtain -strongly truthful mechanisms on any stochastically relevant prior, which is the maximal possible prior.

Subspace differential privacy,"Jie Gao, Ruobin Gong, Fang-Yi Yu",2022/6/28,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"Many data applications have certain invariant constraints due to practical needs. Data curators who employ differential privacy need to respect such constraints on the sanitized data product as a primary utility requirement. Invariants challenge the formulation, implementation, and interpretation of privacy guarantees. We propose subspace differential privacy, to honestly characterize the dependence of the sanitized output on confidential aspects of the data. We discuss two design frameworks that convert well-known differentially private mechanisms, such as the Gaussian and the Laplace mechanisms, to subspace differentially private ones that respect the invariants specified by the curator. For linear queries, we discuss the design of near-optimal mechanisms that minimize the mean squared error. Subspace differentially private mechanisms rid the need for post-processing due to invariants, preserve transparency and statistical intelligibility of the output, and can be suitable for distributed implementation. We showcase the proposed mechanisms on the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance demonstration data, and a spatio-temporal dataset of mobile access point connections on a large university campus.",5
Optimal scoring rule design,"Yiling Chen, Fang-Yi Yu",2021/7/15,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.07420,"This paper introduces an optimization problem for proper scoring rule design. Consider a principal who wants to collect an agent's prediction about an unknown state. The agent can either report his prior prediction or access a costly signal and report the posterior prediction. Given a collection of possible distributions containing the agent's posterior prediction distribution, the principal's objective is to design a bounded scoring rule to maximize the agent's worst-case payoff increment between reporting his posterior prediction and reporting his prior prediction. We study two settings of such optimization for proper scoring rules: static and asymptotic settings. In the static setting, where the agent can access one signal, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute an optimal scoring rule when the collection of distributions is finite. The agent can adaptively and indefinitely refine his prediction in the asymptotic setting. We first consider a sequence of collections of posterior distributions with vanishing covariance, which emulates general estimators with large samples, and show the optimality of the quadratic scoring rule. Then, when the agent's posterior distribution is a Beta-Bernoulli process, we find that the log scoring rule is optimal. We also prove the optimality of the log scoring rule over a smaller set of functions for categorical distributions with Dirichlet priors.",5

Engineering agreement: the naming game with asymmetric and heterogeneous agents,"Jie Gao, Bo Li, Grant Schoenebeck, Fang-Yi Yu",2017/2/10,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"Being popular in language evolution, cognitive science, and culture dynamics, the Naming Game has been widely used to analyze how agents reach global consensus via communications in multi-agent systems. Most prior work considered networks that are symmetric and homogeneous (eg, vertex transitive). In this paper we consider asymmetric or heterogeneous settings that complement the current literature: 1) we show that increasing asymmetry in network topology can improve convergence rates. The star graph empirically converges faster than all previously studied graphs; 2) we consider graph topologies that are particularly challenging for naming game such as disjoint cliques or multi-level trees and ask how much extra homogeneity (random edges) is required to allow convergence or fast convergence. We provided theoretical analysis which was confirmed by simulations; 3) we analyze how consensus can be manipulated when stubborn nodes are introduced at different points of the process. Early introduction of stubborn nodes can easily influence the outcome in certain family of networks while late introduction of stubborn nodes has much less power.",5

Complex contagions on configuration model graphs with a power-law degree distribution,"Grant Schoenebeck, Fang-Yi Yu",2016,"Conference Web and Internet Economics: 12th International Conference, WINE 2016, Montreal, Canada, December 11-14, 2016, Proceedings 12","In this paper we analyze k-complex contagions (sometimes called bootstrap percolation) on configuration model graphs with a power-law distribution.

This complements the prior work which shows that for  boot strap percolation does not spread to a constant fraction of the graph unless a constant fraction of nodes are initially infected.

"Think globally, act locally: On the optimal seeding for nonsubmodular influence maximization","Grant Schoenebeck, Biaoshuai Tao, Fang-Yi Yu",2020/3/23,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.10393,"We study the -complex contagion influence maximization problem. In the influence maximization problem, one chooses a fixed number of initial seeds in a social network to maximize the spread of their influence. In the -complex contagion model, each uninfected vertex in the network becomes infected if it has at least  infected neighbors. In this paper, we focus on a random graph model named the stochastic hierarchical blockmodel, which is a special case of the well-studied stochastic blockmodel. When the graph is not exceptionally sparse, in particular, when each edge appears with probability , under certain mild assumptions, we prove that the optimal seeding strategy is to put all the seeds in a single community. This matches the intuition that in a nonsubmodular cascade model placing seeds near each other creates synergy. However, it sharply contrasts with the intuition for submodular cascade models (e.g., the independent cascade model and the linear threshold model) in which nearby seeds tend to erode each others' effects. Our key technique is a novel time-asynchronized coupling of four cascade processes. Finally, we show that this observation yields a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm which outputs optimal seeds if each edge appears with a probability either in  or in .",4
Limitations of greed: Influence maximization in undirected networks re-visited,"Grant Schoenebeck, Biaoshuai Tao, Fang-Yi Yu",2020/2/26,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.11679,"We consider the influence maximization problem (selecting  seeds in a network maximizing the expected total influence) on undirected graphs under the linear threshold model. On the one hand, we prove that the greedy algorithm always achieves a -approximation, showing that the greedy algorithm does slightly better on undirected graphs than the generic  bound which also applies to directed graphs. On the other hand, we show that substantial improvement on this bound is impossible by presenting an example where the greedy algorithm can obtain at most a  approximation. This result stands in contrast to the previous work on the independent cascade model. Like the linear threshold model, the greedy algorithm obtains a -approximation on directed graphs in the independent cascade model. However, Khanna and Lucier showed that, in undirected graphs, the greedy algorithm performs substantially better: a  approximation for constant . Our results show that, surprisingly, no such improvement occurs in the linear threshold model. Finally, we show that, under the linear threshold model, the approximation ratio  is tight if 1) the graph is directed or 2) the vertices are weighted. In other words, under either of these two settings, the greedy algorithm cannot achieve a -approximation for any positive function . The result in setting 2) is again in a sharp contrast to Khanna and Lucier's -approximation result for the independent cascade model, where the  approximation guarantee can be …",4
The limits of multi-task peer prediction,"Shuran Zheng, Fang-Yi Yu, Yiling Chen",2021/7/18,Book Proceedings of the 22nd ACM Conference on Economics and Computation,"Recent advances in multi-task peer prediction have greatly expanded our knowledge about the power of multi-task peer prediction mechanisms.

But we still lack understanding about when desirable mechanisms will exist for a multi-task peer prediction problem. In this work, we study the elicitability of multi-task peer prediction problems. We consider a designer who has certain knowledge about the underlying information structure and wants to elicit certain information from a group of participants. Our goal is to infer the possibility of having a desirable mechanism based on the primitives of the problem. Our contribution is twofold.

Peer Prediction for Learning Agents,"Shi Feng, Fang-Yi Yu, Yiling Chen",2022/8/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.04433,"Peer prediction refers to a collection of mechanisms for eliciting information from human agents when direct verification of the obtained information is unavailable. They are designed to have a game-theoretic equilibrium where everyone reveals their private information truthfully. This result holds under the assumption that agents are Bayesian and they each adopt a fixed strategy across all tasks. Human agents however are observed in many domains to exhibit learning behavior in sequential settings. In this paper, we explore the dynamics of sequential peer prediction mechanisms when participants are learning agents. We first show that the notion of no regret alone for the agents' learning algorithms cannot guarantee convergence to the truthful strategy. We then focus on a family of learning algorithms where strategy updates only depend on agents' cumulative rewards and prove that agents' strategies in the popular Correlated Agreement (CA) mechanism converge to truthful reporting when they use algorithms from this family. This family of algorithms is not necessarily no-regret, but includes several familiar no-regret learning algorithms (e.g multiplicative weight update and Follow the Perturbed Leader) as special cases. Simulation of several algorithms in this family as well as the -greedy algorithm, which is outside of this family, shows convergence to the truthful strategy in the CA mechanism.",1
Cooperation in Threshold Public Projects with Binary Actions,"Yiling Chen, Biaoshuai Tao, Fang-Yi Yu",2021/5/18,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.08572,"When can cooperation arise from self-interested decisions in public goods games? And how can we help agents to act cooperatively? We examine these classical questions in a pivotal participation game, a variant of public good games, where heterogeneous agents make binary participation decisions on contributing their endowments, and the public project succeeds when it has enough contributions. We prove it is NP-complete to decide the existence of a cooperative Nash equilibrium such that the project succeeds. We also identify two natural special scenarios where this decision problem is tractable. We then propose two algorithms to help cooperation in the game. Our first algorithm adds an external investment to the public project, and our second algorithm uses matching funds. We show that the cost to induce a cooperative Nash equilibrium is near-optimal for both algorithms. Finally, the cost of matching funds can always be smaller than the cost of adding an external investment. Intuitively, matching funds provide a greater incentive for cooperation than adding an external investment does.",1
Integer Subspace Differential Privacy,"Prathamesh Dharangutte, Jie Gao, Ruobin Gong, Fang-Yi Yu",2022/12/2,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.00936,"We propose new differential privacy solutions for when external \emph{invariants} and \emph{integer} constraints are simultaneously enforced on the data product. These requirements arise in real world applications of private data curation, including the public release of the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census. They pose a great challenge to the production of provably private data products with adequate statistical usability. We propose \emph{integer subspace differential privacy} to rigorously articulate the privacy guarantee when data products maintain both the invariants and integer characteristics, and demonstrate the composition and post-processing properties of our proposal. To address the challenge of sampling from a potentially highly restricted discrete space, we devise a pair of unbiased additive mechanisms, the generalized Laplace and the generalized Gaussian mechanisms, by solving the Diophantine equations as defined by the constraints. The proposed mechanisms have good accuracy, with errors exhibiting sub-exponential and sub-Gaussian tail probabilities respectively. To implement our proposal, we design an MCMC algorithm and supply empirical convergence assessment using estimated upper bounds on the total variation distance via -lag coupling. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal with applications to a synthetic problem with intersecting invariants, a sensitive contingency table with known margins, and the 2010 Census county-level demonstration data with mandated fixed state population totals.",
A System-Level Analysis of Conference Peer Review,"Yichi Zhang, Fang-Yi Yu, Grant Schoenebeck, David Kempe",2022/7/12,Book Proceedings of the 23rd ACM Conference on Economics and Computation,"We undertake a system-level analysis of the conference peer review process. The process involves three constituencies with different objectives: authors want their papers accepted at prestigious venues (and quickly), conferences want to present a program with many high-quality and few low-quality papers, and reviewers want to avoid being overburdened by reviews. These objectives are far from aligned; the key obstacle is that the evaluation of the merits of a submission (both by the authors and the reviewers) is inherently noisy. Over the years, conferences have experimented with numerous policies and innovations to navigate the tradeoffs. These experiments include setting various bars for acceptance, varying the number of reviews per submission, requiring prior reviews to be included with resubmissions, and others.

Optimal Local Bayesian Differential Privacy over Markov Chains,"Darshan Chakrabarti, Jie Gao, Aditya Saraf, Grant Schoenebeck, Fang-Yi Yu",2022/6/22,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.11402,"In the literature of data privacy, differential privacy is the most popular model. An algorithm is differentially private if its outputs with and without any individual's data are indistinguishable. In this paper, we focus on data generated from a Markov chain and argue that Bayesian differential privacy (BDP) offers more meaningful guarantees in this context. Our main theoretical contribution is providing a mechanism for achieving BDP when data is drawn from a binary Markov chain. We improve on the state-of-the-art BDP mechanism and show that our mechanism provides the optimal noise-privacy tradeoffs for any local mechanism up to negligible factors. We also briefly discuss a non-local mechanism which adds correlated noise. Lastly, we perform experiments on synthetic data that detail when DP is insufficient, and experiments on real data to show that our privacy guarantees are robust to underlying distributions that are not simple Markov chains.",
Timely information from prediction markets,"Grant Schoenebeck, Chenkai Yu, Fang-Yi Yu",2020/11/7,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.03645,"Prediction markets are powerful tools to elicit and aggregate beliefs from strategic agents. However, in current prediction markets, agents may exhaust the social welfare by competing to be the first to update the market. We initiate the study of the trade-off between how quickly information is aggregated by the market, and how much this information costs. We design markets to aggregate timely information from strategic agents to maximize social welfare. To this end, the market must incentivize agents to invest the correct amount of effort to acquire information: quickly enough to be useful, but not faster (and more expensively) than necessary. The market also must ensure that agents report their information truthfully and on time. We consider two settings: in the first, information is only valuable before a deadline; in the second, the value of information decreases as time passes. We use both theorems and simulations to demonstrate the mechanisms.",
