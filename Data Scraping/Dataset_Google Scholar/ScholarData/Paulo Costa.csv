PR-OWL: A Bayesian ontology language for the semantic web,"Paulo Cesar G Da Costa, Kathryn B Laskey, Kenneth J Laskey",2008,"Conference Uncertainty reasoning for the semantic web I: ISWC international workshops, URSW 2005-2007, revised selected and invited papers","This paper addresses a major weakness of current technologies for the Semantic Web, namely the lack of a principled means to represent and reason about uncertainty. This not only hinders the realization of the original vision for the Semantic Web, but also creates a barrier to the development of new, powerful features for general knowledge applications that require proper treatment of uncertain phenomena. We present PR-OWL, a probabilistic extension to the OWL web ontology language that allows legacy ontologies to interoperate with newly developed probabilistic ontologies. PR-OWL moves beyond the current limitations of deterministic classical logic to a full first-order probabilistic logic. By providing a principled means of modeling uncertainty in ontologies, PR-OWL can be seen as a supporting tool for many applications that can benefit from probabilistic inference within an ontology language, thus …",214
PR-OWL: A framework for probabilistic ontologies,"Paulo CG Costa, Kathryn B Laskey",2006/11/9,Journal Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,"Across a wide range of domains, there is an urgent need for a wellfounded approach to incorporating uncertain and incomplete knowledge into formal domain ontologies. Although this subject is receiving increasing attention from ontology researchers, there is as yet no broad consensus on the definition of a probabilistic ontology and on the most suitable approach to extending current ontology languages to support uncertainty. This paper presents two contributions to developing a coherent framework for probabilistic ontologies:(1) a formal definition of a probabilistic ontology, and (2) an extension of the OWL Web Ontology Language that is consistent with our formal definition. This extension, PR-OWL, is based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN), a first-order Bayesian logic that unifies Bayesian probability with First-Order Logic. As such, PR-OWL combines the full representation power of OWL with the flexibility and inferential power of Bayesian logic.",188

Towards unbiased evaluation of uncertainty reasoning: The URREF ontology,"Paulo CG Costa, Kathryn B Laskey, Erik Blasch, Anne-Laure Jousselme",2012/7/9,Conference 2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion,"Current advances in technology, sensor collection, data storage, and data distribution have afforded more complex, distributed, and operational information fusion systems (IFSs). IFSs notionally consist of low-level (data collection, registration, and association in time and space) and high-level information fusion (user coordination, situational awareness, and mission control), which require a common ontology for effective communication and data processing. In this paper, we describe the ontology reference model developed as part of the uncertainty representation and reasoning evaluation framework (URREF). The URREF ontology is intended to provide guidance for defining the actual concepts and criteria that together comprise the comprehensive uncertainty evaluation framework being developed by the Evaluation of Technologies for Uncertainty Representation Working Group (ETURWG).",176

Modeling a probabilistic ontology for maritime domain awareness,"Rommel N Carvalho, Richard Haberlin, Paulo Cesar G Costa, Kathryn B Laskey, Kuo-Chu Chang",2011/7/5,Conference 14th International Conference on Information Fusion,"Situational awareness and prediction are essential elements of information fusion. Both involve various types of uncertainty and require a sound automated inferential process. Probabilistic ontologies support uncertainty management in se-mantically aware systems, and facilitate modular, interoperable systems. This paper describes the process of developing a probabilistic ontology for a Maritime Domain Awareness application. The ontology was created to support identification of ships behaving suspiciously enough to be declared ships of interest. The original model was expanded in two ways: to provide reasons for declaring a ship as being of interest, and to include individual crew member associations. The latter is achieved by supporting inferences about a person's close relations, group associations, communications, and background influences to assess his likelihood of having terrorist links.",53

Among these is Probabilistic Web Ontology Language (PR-OWL), which provides a means of representing uncertainty in ontologies expressed in Web Ontology Language (OWL).

A first-order Bayesian tool for probabilistic ontologies,"Paulo CG Costa, Marcelo Ladeira, Rommel N Carvalho, Kathryn B Laskey, Laécio L Santos, Shou Matsumoto",2008/5/15,Journal Proceedings of the Twenty-First International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference,"One of the major weaknesses of current research on the Semantic Web (SW) is the lack of proper means to represent and reason with uncertainty. A number of recent efforts from the SW community, the W3C, and others have recently emerged to address this gap. Such efforts have the positive side effect of bringing together two fields of research that have been apart for historical reasons, the artificial intelligence and the SW communities. One example of the potential research gains of this convergence is the current development of Probabilistic OWL (PROWL), an extension of the OWL Web Ontology Language that provides a framework to build probabilistic ontologies, thus enabling proper representation and reasoning with uncertainty within the SW context. PR-OWL is based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN), a first-order probabilistic logic that combines the representational power of first-order logic (FOL) and Bayesian Networks (BN). However, PR-OWL and MEBN are still in development, lacking a software tool that implements their underlying concepts. The development of UnBBayes-MEBN, an open source, Java-based application that is currently in alpha phase (public release March 08), addresses this gap by providing both a GUI for building probabilistic ontologies and a reasoner based on the PR-OWL/MEBN framework. This work focuses on the major challenges of UnBBayes-MEBN implementation, describes the features already implemented, and provides an overview of the major algorithms, mainly the one used for building a Situation Specific Bayesian Network (SSBN) from a MEBN Theory.",47

PROGNOS: applying probabilistic ontologies to distributed predictive situation assessment in naval operations,"Paulo CG Costa, Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, K Chang",2009/6/15,Journal Proceedings of the 14th ICCRTS,"Achieving agile Command and Control in Maritime Operations requires composeability-the ability to construct responses “on the fly” to queries about a given situation, by discovering and drawing upon the appropriate resources from among the vast collection of resources existing on a distributed network. Although net-centric architectures such as FORCEnet provide the necessary connectivity and computational power needed to achieve fast and adaptive decision cycles, the sheer volume of data creates informational and cognitive bottlenecks that hinder agility. To address these limitations, new approaches bridging the gap from data interchange to knowledge interchange are needed, enabling C2 systems to produce a dynamic, comprehensive, and accurate battlespace picture. This is the main focus of PROGNOS, a system for Predictive Naval Situation Awareness currently being developed at George Mason University’s C4I Center. PROGNOS will integrate four state-of-the-art enabling technologies into a distributed system architecture that represents domain knowledge as a modular collection of probabilistic ontologies, combine these “knowledge nuggets” dynamically into complex situation models, and apply theoretically sound, computationally efficient hypothesis management and inference to combine evidence and background knowledge to reason about the current situation.

MEBN logic: A key enabler for network centric warfare,"Paulo CG Costa, Kathryn B Laskey, Masami Takikawa, Michael Pool, Francis Fung, Edward J Wright",2005,Publisher CCRP Publications,"Among the lessons learned from recent conflicts stands the dramatic change in the very way wars are fought. There are no more clear-cut enemies or allies; rules of engagement have become increasingly fuzzy; guerrilla and insurgent tactics are now commonplace: in short, the battlespace is a very different place from what it used to be. Furthermore, advances in sensor technology and network computing have brought a new element to the complex equation of warfare: information overload. Nowadays, instead of merely gathering information and displaying assets, command and control systems must be able to fill the gap between the glut of information arriving from a networked grid of sensors and the capacity of human commanders to make sense of it. In short, the quest today is for systems that work under the knowledge paradigm. Systems must automatically provide decision makers with a clear picture of what is happening, how it relates to the current situation, and what are the options and their respective consequences. Facing this challenge with technologies of the past is a recipe for failure.  New, more powerful approaches are needed. The objective of this paper is to argue for two claims: (1) Bayesian decision theory is an appropriate technology for modeling human decision-making in complex, ambiguous scenarios; and (2) Bayesian reasoning technology is a promising enabler for Network Centric Warfare.

Multi-entity bayesian networks learning in predictive situation awareness,"Cheol Y Park, Kathryn B Laskey, Paulo Costa, Shou Matsumoto",2013/6/1,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA VOLGENAU SCHOOL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING,"Over the past two decades, machine learning has led to substantial changes in Data Fusion Systems globally. One of the most important application areas for data fusion is situation awareness to support command and control. Situation awareness is perception of elements in the environment, comprehension of the current situation, and projection of future status before decision making. Traditional fusion systems focus on lower levels of the JDL hierarchy, leaving higher-level fusion and situation awareness largely to unaided human judgment. This becomes untenable in todays increasingly data-rich environments, characterized by information and cognitive overload. Higher-level fusion to support situation awareness requires semantically rich representations amenable to automated processing. Ontologies are an essential tool for representing domain semantics and expressing information about entities and relationships in the domain. Probabilistic ontologies augment standard ontologies with support for uncertainty management, which is essential for higher-level fusion to support situation awareness.

Determining model correctness for situations of belief fusion,"Audun Jøsang, Paulo CG Costa, Erik Blasch",2013/7/9,Conference Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Information Fusion,"When analyzing hypotheses about specific situations of interest there is often a need to combine information from multiple sources.

Because different situations can involve different forms of belief fusion, there is no single formal model that is suitable for analyzing every situation. It is therefore crucial to identify the most adequate fusion operator for modeling each class of situations to be analyzed. It can be challenging to determine the best belief fusion model for a specific situation, and there has been considerable confusion around this issue in the literature.

Traditional fusion systems focus on lower levels of the JDL hierarchy, leaving higher-level fusion and situation awareness largely to unaided human judgment.

Transforming raw data into high-level information fusion (HLIF) products, such as situation displays, automated decision support, and predictive analysis, relies heavily on human cognition. There is a clear lack of automated solutions for HLIF, making such systems prone to scalability issues. In this paper, we propose to address this issue with the use of highly expressive Bayesian models, which can provide a tighter link between information coming from low-level sources and the high-level information fusion systems, and allow for greater automation of the overall process. We illustrate our ideas with a naval HLIF system, and show the results of a preliminary set of experiments.",22

CEUR-WS. org","Evaluating the impact that events within the cyber domain have on a military operation and its critical infrastructure is a non-trivial question, which remains unanswered so far in spite of the various research efforts addressing it. The key issue underlying this question is the difficulty in correlating cyber and physical behaviors in an integrated view, thus allowing for real-time analysis. This paper addresses the issue with the development of an ontology-based framework in which the cyber and physical behaviors are integrated in a consolidated view, using a combination of open standards protocols and semantic technologies. In our approach, the mission and its physical aspects are modeled using a business process language (eg, BPMN) and an information infrastructure based on Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). In this scheme, changes in the environment are captured using the output of sensor components existing in the infrastructure. In order to ensure a complete and integrated analysis of the accruing data, we have developed a Cyber Situation ontology (in OWL) and a methodology for mapping the cyber and the physical domains. In this framework, mission data from the environment is retrieved and fused using an engine based on the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). The output of this process is then presented to an analyst in a way that only the most important information needed to support his/her decisions is shown. To validate our approach, a real air traffic scenario was modeled and many simulated flights were generated to support of our experiments.",21

The growing demand for interconnectivity and interoperability gives rise to systems of ever-greater complexity. These include systems of systems, whose subsystems are systems in their own right, often geographically distributed and exhibiting ownership and/or managerial independence. Along with the increasing complexity of systems comes a growing demand for systems that act intelligently and adaptively in response to their environments. There is a need for systems that can process incomplete, uncertain and ambiguous information, and can learn and adapt to environments that require interoperating with other intelligent, adaptive complex systems.",11

Probabilistic ontologies for Multi-INT fusion,"Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, Paulo CG Costa, Terry Janssen",2010/8/2,Journal Ontologies and Semantic Technologies for Intelligence,"Systems are increasingly required to fuse data from geographically dispersed, heterogeneous information sources to produce up-to-date, missionrelevant results. These products focus not only on traditional military forces and systems, but to an increasing degree also on non-traditional combatants and their social networks. Successful multi-INT fusion requires that the constituent systems interoperate not just at the level of syntax and formats, but also at the level of semantics. Ontologies are vital enablers for semantic interoperability. Because uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of multi-INT fusion, lack of support for uncertainty is a major limitation of current-generation ontology formalisms. Probabilistic OWL (PR-OWL) extends the OWL Web Ontology Language to enable the construction of probabilistic ontologies. Ontologies constructed in PROWL can represent complex patterns of evidential relationships among uncertain hypotheses. Recently, a system for specifying and reasoning with PR-OWL ontologies has been released in beta version. This paper describes the PR-OWL ontology language, the probabilistic logic on which it is based, and the reasoning system implementation. A hypothetical case study in the counterterrorism domain illustrates the capabilities of PR-OWL.",10

Advanced decision support systems will provide the decision maker with a number of hypotheses from which the evolving situation may be inferred, limited by the computational capacity of todays computer hardware. In this context, a hypothesis can be thought of as a statement of anticipated action in which an actor will conduct an action against a target with a location, time and methodology of his choosing. Hypothesis Management is the control of exponential growth in fusion hypotheses created by incoming data reports, without which the computational capability of hardware is quickly overwhelmed. This paper explores our research on Hypothesis Management techniques in support of inferential reasoning. More specifically, we focus on managing the creation, modification, administration, storage and movement of hypotheses to ensure that only attributes and entities relative to the current context are presented for inferential reasoning. Our approach supports recognition of observed trends and is capable of creating original hypothesis through innovative transformations of existing hypotheses, providing the decision maker with asymmetrical scenario possibilities gleaned from observed attribute data and stored hypothesis histories.",10
Uncertainty-driven ontology for decision support system in air transport,"Carlos C Insaurralde, Erik P Blasch, Paulo CG Costa, Krishna Sampigethaya",2022/1/25,Journal Electronics,"Recent electronics advances for air transport have increased aircraft density, volume, and frequency in the airspace. These advances come with control requirements for precise navigation, coordinated Air Traffic Management (ATM) or Unmanned aircraft system Traffic Management (UTM), and proactive security. The tight tolerances of aircraft control necessitate management of spatial uncertainty, timeliness precision, and confidence assessment, which have, respectively, variance, reliability, and veracity situation awareness and assessment metrics. Meeting such airspace requirements involves the ability to evaluate how those metrics impact ATM/UTM operations, making the complex interrelationships between them a key aspect for coping with the fast worldwide growth of air transport. To support such growth, ontologies have been proposed as a promising technology for making such interrelationships explicit, while facilitating communication between avionics devices. This paper investigates the use of ontologies in support of electronic ATM/UTM operations, highlighting the use of Uncertainty Representation and the Reasoning Evaluation Framework (URREF) in realizing the ability for Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) to semantically communicate with aircraft operators concerning physical airspace coordination. Using Avionics Analytics Ontology (AAO) endowed with the URREF, application examples based on two airspace situations are presented.

Recently, malware detection based on low-level hardware features (e.g., Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) information) has emerged as an effective alternative solution to address the complexity and performance overheads of traditional software-based detection methods. Hardware-assisted Malware Detection (HMD) techniques depend on standard Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to detect signatures of malicious applications by monitoring built-in HPC registers during execution at run-time. Prior HMD methods though effective have limited their study on detecting malicious applications that are spawned as a separate thread during application execution, hence detecting stealthy malware patterns at run-time remains a critical challenge. Stealthy malware refers to harmful cyber attacks in which malicious code is hidden within benign applications and remains undetected by traditional malware detection approaches. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive review of recent advances in hardware-assisted malware detection studies that have used standard ML techniques to detect the malware signatures.

This paper presents an extension to the Hybrid Message Passing inference algorithm for general CG networks (i.e., networks with loops and many discrete parents). The extended algorithm uses Gaussian mixture reduction to prevent an exponential increase in the number of Gaussian mixture components. Experimental results compare performance of the new algorithm with existing algorithms.",4
Automated Ontology Creation using XML Schema Elements.,"Samuel Suhas Singapogu, Paulo CG Costa, J Mark Pullen",2015,Conference STIDS,"Ontologies are commonly used to represent formal semantics in a computer system, usually capturing them in the form of concepts, relationships and axioms. Axioms convey asserted knowledge and support inferring new knowledge through logical reasoning. For complex systems, the process of creating ontologies manually can be tedious and error-prone. Many automated methods of knowledge discovery are based on mining domain text corpus, but current state-of-the-art methods using this approach fail to consider properly semantic data embedded in XML schemata in complex systems. This paper proposes a mapping method for identifying relevant semantic data in XML schemata, automatically structuring and representing it in the form of a draft ontology. Concepts, concept hierarchy and domain relationships from XML schema are mapped to relevant parts of an OWL ontology. A part-ofspeech tagging method extracts domain relationships from schema annotations. This mapping method can be applied to any system that has a well-annotated XML schema. We illustrate our process with the preliminary results obtained when creating a command and control to simulation (C2SIM) draft ontology from an XML schema.",4

Greater emphasis is placed on interoperability and composeability. New technologies such as SOA and semantically aware systems have come into the spotlight. This paper argues that just as the problem space demands interoperability of diverse technologies, so must the solution space. In other words, not only are new approaches needed, but they must also come together as a seamlessly interoperable technological tool set. This can be accomplished only via a consistent multi-disciplinary approach. In this paper, we present some of the major requirements of today’s Predictive Situation Awareness Systems (PSAW), propose our approach as a coordinated mix between state-of-the-art research efforts, and present the architecture for enabling our approach.",4

ADS-Bsec: a holistic framework to secure ADS-B,"Thabet Kacem, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo Cesar Guerreiro Da Costa, Alexandre de Barros Barreto",2021/6/1,Patent office US,"Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) is one of the most prominent air traffic surveillance technologies. It can be used not only as a complement in existing radar-based technologies to locate aircraft, but also as a replacement in areas without radar coverage. However, a major flaw in the deployment of this technology is it reliance on clear-text, open broadcast of messages, which makes it vulnerable to attackers. A solution to this vulnerability is ADS-Bsec, a holistic framework that solves the root cause of ADS-B problems by enforcing authenticity and integrity in ADS-B messages. This is accomplished without changing the message format and, along with a proper key exchange mechanism.

Through such reasoning, a fusion system can estimate the quality and relevance of data sources at runtime which, in turn, is used for automatic adaptation of the source models.

Sharing Data under Genetic Privacy Laws.,"Michael Reep, Bo Yu, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo CG Costa",2016,Conference STIDS,"Clinical medical practice and biomedical research utilize genetic information for specific purposes. Irrespective of the purpose of obtaining genetic material, methodologies for protecting the privacy of patients/donors in both clinical and research settings have not kept pace with rapid genetic advances. When the usage of genetic information is not predicated on the latest laws and policies, the result places all-important patient/donor privacy at risk. Some methodologies err on the side of overly stringent policies that may inhibit research and openended diagnostic activity, whereas an opposite approach advocates a high-degree of openness that can jeopardize patient privacy, identifying patient relatives and erode the doctor-patient privilege. As a solution, we present a unique approach that is based on the premise that acceptable clinical treatment regimens are captured in workflows used by caregivers and researchers and therefore their associated purpose can be extracted from these workflows. We combine these purposes with applicable consents (derived from applicable laws) to ascertain the releasability of genetic information.

An Extended Maritime Domain Awareness Probabilistic Ontology Derived from Human-aided Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks Learning.,"Cheol Young Park, Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, Paulo CG Costa",2016,Conference STIDS,"Ontologies have been commonly associated with representing a domain using deterministic information. Probabilistic Ontologies extend this capability by incorporating formal probabilistic semantics. PR-OWL is a language that extends OWL with semantics based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN), a Bayesian probabilistic logic. Developing probabilistic ontologies can be greatly facilitated by the use of a modeling framework such as the Uncertainty Modeling Process for Semantic Technology (UMP-ST). An example of using UMPST was the development of a probabilistic ontology to support PROGNOS (PRobabilistic OntoloGies for Net-Centric Operational Systems), a system that supports Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). The PROGNOS probabilistic ontology provides semantically aware uncertainty management to support fusion of heterogeneous input and probabilistic assessment of situations to improve MDA. However, manually developing and maintaining a probabilistic ontology is a labor-intensive and insufficiently agile process. Greater automation through a combination of reference models and machine learning methods may enhance agility in probabilistic situation awareness (PSAW) systems. For this reason, a process for Human-aided MEBN Learning in PSAW (HMLP) was suggested. In previous work, we used UMP-ST to develop the PROGNOS probabilistic ontology. This paper presents an extended PROGNOS probabilistic ontology developed using HMLP. The contribution of this research is to introduce the extended PROGNOS probabilistic ontology and present a comparison between two processes (UMPST and …",3

Ontological considerations for uncertainty propagation in high level information fusion,"Mark Locher, Paulo C Costa",2013/1/1,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA,"Uncertainty propagation in a level 2 high level information fusion HLIF process is affected by a number of considerations. These include the varying complexities of the various types of level 2 HLIF. Five different types are identified, ranging from simple entity attribute refinement using situation status data to the development of a complete situation assessment assembled from applicable situational fragment data. Additional considerations include uncertainty handling in the input data, uncertainty representation, the effects of the reasoning technique used in the fusion process, and output considerations. Input data considerations include the data s relevance to the situation, its credibility, and its force or weight. Uncertainty representation concerns follow the uncertainty ontology developed by the W3C Incubator Group on Uncertainty Reasoning. For uncertainty effects of the fusion process, a basic fusion process model is presented, showing the impacts of uncertainty in four areas.

Study of MEBN Learning for Relational Model.,"Cheol Young Park, Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, Paulo Cesar G da Costa, Shou Matsumoto",2012,Conference STIDS,"(SRL) has emerged as a new branch of machine learning for representing and learning a joint probability distribution over relational data. Relational representations have the necessary expressive power for important real-world problems, but until recently have not supported uncertainty. Statistical relational models fill this gap. Among the languages recently developed for statistical relational representations is Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN). MEBN is the logical basis for Probabilistic OWL (PR-OWL), a language for uncertainty reasoning in the Semantic Web. However, until now there has been no implementation of MEBN learning. This paper describes the first implementation of MEBN learning. The algorithm learns a MEBN theory for a domain from data stored in a relational Database. Several issues are addressed such as aggregating influences, optimization problem, and so on. In this paper, as our contributions, we will provide a MEBN-RM (Relational Model) Model which is a bridge between MEBN and RM, and suggest a basic structure learning algorithm for MEBN.

Gaussian mixture reduction for time-constrained approximate inference in hybrid Bayesian networks,"Cheol Young Park, Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, Paulo CG Costa, Shou Matsumoto",2019/5/18,Journal Applied Sciences,"Hybrid Bayesian Networks (HBNs), which contain both discrete and continuous variables, arise naturally in many application areas (e.g., image understanding, data fusion, medical diagnosis, fraud detection). This paper concerns inference in an important subclass of HBNs, the conditional Gaussian (CG) networks, in which all continuous random variables have Gaussian distributions and all children of continuous random variables must be continuous. Inference in CG networks can be NP-hard even for special-case structures, such as poly-trees, where inference in discrete Bayesian networks can be performed in polynomial time. Therefore, approximate inference is required. In approximate inference, it is often necessary to trade off accuracy against solution time. This paper presents an extension to the Hybrid Message Passing inference algorithm for general CG networks and an algorithm for optimizing its accuracy given a bound on computation time. The extended algorithm uses Gaussian mixture reduction to prevent an exponential increase in the number of Gaussian mixture components. The trade-off algorithm performs pre-processing to find optimal run-time settings for the extended algorithm.

In order to do so, nine Santa Inês sheep were kept on pasture, exposed to the climate directly, without shade, for 24 days, with 12 alternate days in each period (dry and raining) in 2015. The behavioral parameters evaluated were: food consumption, standing idleness, lying idle and rumination. Observations occurred from 08:00 A.M. to 05:55 P.M. The experimental was a completely randomized design (CRD) with two treatments (rainy season and dry period), nine replications, one animal per experimental unit. To understand the correlations of the behavioral parameters with the climatic variables, Pearson’s correlation was performed. Approximate average values between the rainy and dry periods for the behavioral variables were observed, but there was a greater intake in the volume of water in the dry period (9.59L/sheep). Also, there were significant differences in the behavior of the animals throughout the day. In the hottest time of the day, at 02:00 P.M., there was standing idle of 25.83min., lying idle of 1.21min., and spent less time-consuming food (27.08min.) in relation to other schedules. We concluded that the sheep had similar behavioral parameters in the rainy and dry periods, but when we observe the times of the days, the behaviors are different.

Given the unknown vulnerabilities of large, complex Command and Control C2 systems, organizations will protect the most critical assets essential for mission success. Cyber-ARGUS is a methodology that provides a mapping between the cyber and the operational domains, substantially improving the monitoring of information infrastructure networks supporting missions by correlating their status to mission goals. This enables a proactive, context-based response to ensure that cyber attacks will not affect ongoing operations. Cyber-ARGUS relies upon a unique approach of modeling the network and the mission separately. After modeling the mission, the mission s tasks are mapped into services required for the mission, and these services are allocated to network nodes to form a Mission Network Graph. A vulnerability assessment and an enemy behavior analysis are conducted to determine which vulnerabilities the network is exposed to. This information is then used to adjust the node values in the Mission Network Graph, represented as a Bayesian Network, to calculate the impact assessment for each node.

Ontologies are vital enablers for semantic interoperability. Because uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of multi-INT fusion, lack of support for uncertainty is a major limitation of current-generation ontology formalisms.

In order to satisfy this need, we describe a comprehensive ontology for genetic privacy based on existing applicable laws. Our ontology is used in ontological rule bases within medical workflows that are directly integrated with electronic health records. As shown in our ongoing work, this integration provides a solid foundation for enforcing laws and regulations in preventing unlawful disclosures of genetic information.",1
Pragmatic data fusion uncertainty concerns: Tribute to Dave L. Hall,"Erik Blasch, Paulo CG Costa, J Pieter De Villiers, Kathryn B Laskey, James Llinas, Anne-Laure Jousselme",2016/7/5,Conference 2016 19th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION),"Over the course of Dave Hall's career, he highlighted various concerns associated with the implementation of data fusion methods. Many of the issues included the role of uncertainty in data fusion, practical implementation of sensor fusion systems, and incorporating new technology into information fusion designs. These thoughts were communicated through technical books and Handbook collections of articles from authors in the fusion community as comprehensive discussions of data collection and processing to knowledge acquisition and delivery. A summary of the uncertainty issues from Dave Hall, originating with the Joint Directors of the Laboratories (JDL) model, include these attributes across the JDL Levels which are: data (variance), object assessment (covariance), situation (representation), threat (possibility), sensor management (delay), and user (cognition).

Genetic Counseling Using Workflow-based EMRs.,"Bo Yu, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo CG Costa, Sharath Hiremegalore",2015,Conference STIDS,"Widespread use of genetic tests for medical treatment and clinical genetic counseling–as a cost-effective treatment for an increasing number of hereditary disorders–has led to study of privacy and disclosure issues, and has compelled governments to limit disclosure of test results. To the best of our knowledge, no clinical workflows for genetic counseling apply applicable information disclosure laws have been documented and enforced in Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). To fill this void, herein we model a representative genetic counseling workflow and show how to simultaneously enforce privacy and informed consents in an open-source EMR. Our prototype provides workflow-guided counseling as well as consent management that enforces state and federal lawcompliant genetic information sharing.",1
Evaluating complex fusion systems based on causal probabilistic models,"Franck Mignet, Gregor Pavlin, Patrick de Oude, Paulo CG Costa",2013/7/9,Conference Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Information Fusion,"The paper evaluates a class of fusion systems that support interpretation of complex patterns consisting of large numbers of heterogeneous data obtained from distributed sources at different points in time. The fusion solutions in such domains must be able to process large quantities of heterogeneous information of different quality and adapt at runtime to accommodate for new data sources. This requires models consisting of many variables representing different types of correlated phenomena. In addition, the models are typically severe abstractions associated with significant uncertainties. By using probabilistic causal models we can efficiently build reliable fusion systems that can cope with the above mentioned challenges in a robust manner in a relevant class of applications. The resulting solutions simultaneously satisfy a range of criteria associated with the correctness, scalability, performance, knowledge …",1
COA Modeling with Probabilistic Ontologies.,"Henrique Costa Marques, José MP de Oliveira, Paulo Cesar G da Costa",2011,Conference STIDS,"Planning during complex endeavors is a daunting task in many aspects. An important one is the representation of shared intent, which is an open research topic focused on expressing a common picture among different planning systems with distinct languages, and sometimes disparate problem solving methodologies. The common approach is to use a translator between the order/request message and the planning system, which doesn’t convey all the elements that are necessary to support the planning task. The present research proposes to address this issue by the use of a semantic layer as an interface among different planning systems, which not only improves interoperability but also provides support for pruning the search space before the information is sent to the planning system. The layer is based on a probabilistic ontology, which provides shared intent description as well as formalization of the operational domain and of the planning problem, including a principled representation of the involved uncertainty. The proposed scheme supports previous analysis of the search space in order to send to the planning system a concise set of tasks that will contribute to reach the desired end state.",1

In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework based on modeling and simulation that intends to capture the core elements involved in maintaining a COP across the components of a complex distributed and heterogeneous enterprise.",1
Probabilistic Ontologies and Pragmatics For Complex Systems Integration,"Paulo Cesar G da Costa, Bernard Zeigler, Michael Hieb, Kathryn B Laskey",2010,"Description Information systems are increasingly pervasive in our lives, and are becoming increasingly sophisticated as technology evolves.

Current approaches to high-level fusion require cognitively burdensome manual processing. Because uncertainty is ubiquitous, support for uncertainty is essential to successful knowledge fusion. Traditional ontology formalisms lack inbuilt methods to represent and process uncertainty.

Pr-owl: A framework for bayesian ontologies,"Paulo CG Costa, Kathryn B Laskey",2006,Publisher IOS Press,"Across a wide range of domains, there is an urgent need for a wellfounded approach to incorporating uncertain and incomplete knowledge into formal domain ontologies. Although this subject is receiving increasing attention from ontology researchers, there is as yet no broad consensus on the definition of a probabilistic ontology and on the most suitable approach to extending current ontology languages to support uncertainty. This paper presents two contributions to developing a coherent framework for probabilistic ontologies: (1) a formal definition of a probabilistic ontology, and (2) an extension of the OWL Web Ontology Language that is consistent with our formal definition. This extension, PR-OWL, is based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN), a first-order Bayesian logic that unifies Bayesian probability with First-Order Logic. As such, PR-OWL combines the full representation power of OWL with the flexibility and inferential power of Bayesian logic.",1

Fabrication plants must deal with re-entrant flows to support multiple types of wafers being produced simultaneously, each with their own deadlines and specifications. The manufacturing process itself depends upon the ability to control and programmatically adjust a variety of environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, and air quality. In addition, wafer fabrication consumes large amounts of electricity. Emerging technologies may help reduce the energy footprint of such facilities but can introduce cybersecurity risks. Therefore, this paper presents a modeling and simulation framework to quantify tradeoffs between operational measures of performance, energy consumption, and cybersecurity controls. We augment the Intel Minifab model, with the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) for cybersecurity as well as tool-level energy consumption data from a real-world semiconductor manufacturing testbed. In this manner, we intend to provide stakeholders with a systematic, data-driven approach to evaluate emerging risks within the manufacturing process.",

"Uncertainty-Driven Ontology for Decision Support System in Air Transport.

These advances come with control requirements for precise navigation, coordinated Air Traffic Management (ATM) or Unmanned aircraft system Traffic Management (UTM), and proactive security. The tight tolerances of aircraft control necessitate management of spatial uncertainty, timeliness precision, and confidence assessment, which have, respectively, variance, reliability, and veracity situation awareness and assessment metrics. Meeting such airspace requirements involves the ability to evaluate how those metrics impact ATM/UTM operations, making the complex interrelationships between them a key aspect for coping with the fast worldwide growth of air transport. To support such growth, ontologies have been proposed as a promising technology for making such interrelationships explicit, while facilitating communication between avionics devices. This paper investigates the use of ontologies in support of electronic ATM/UTM operations, highlighting the use of Uncertainty Representation and the Reasoning Evaluation Framework (URREF) in realizing the ability for Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) to semantically communicate with aircraft operators concerning physical airspace coordination. Using Avionics Analytics Ontology (AAO) endowed with the URREF, application examples based on two airspace situations are presented. Example results for northeast coast of Brazil atmospheric volcanic ash as well as for the Eyjafjallajokull volcano eruption show a 65–80% success in providing warnings to ATCs for airspace control …",
Dynamic Explanation of Bayesian Networks with Abductive Bayes Factor Qualitative Propagation and Entropy-Based Qualitative Explanation,"Shou Matsumoto, Alexandre Barreto, Paulo CG Costa, Brett Benyo, Michael Atighetchi, Daniel Javorsek",2021/11/1,Conference 2021 IEEE 24th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION),"The success of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems as decision aids is often largely contingent on the ability to trust their recommendations.

Design patterns for modeling first-order expressive Bayesian networks,"Mark Locher, Kathryn B Laskey, Paulo CG Costa",2020,Journal The Knowledge Engineering Review,"First-order expressive capabilities allow Bayesian networks (BNs) to model problem domains where the number of entities, their attributes, and their relationships can vary significantly between model instantiations. First-order BNs are well-suited for capturing knowledge representation dependencies, but literature on design patterns specific to first-order BNs is few and scattered. To identify useful patterns, we investigated the range of dependency models between combinations of random variables (RVs) that represent unary attributes, functional relationships, and binary predicate relationships. We found eight major patterns, grouped into three categories, that cover a significant number of first-order BN situations. Selection behavior occurs in six patterns, where a relationship/attribute identifies which entities in a second relationship/attribute are applicable.

Uranium (VI) reduction in a fixed-film reactor by a bacterial consortium isolated from uranium mining tailing heaps,"Paulo Costa, Anne-Laure Jousselme, Kathryn Laskey, Erik Blasch, Valentina Dragos, Juergen Ziegler, Phalazane Johanna Mtimunye, Evans Chirwa",2019,Publisher Elsevier,"Biological uranium (VI) reduction was investigated using a mixed-culture of U(VI) reducing bacteria isolated from tailing dumps at an abandoned uranium mine in Pharaborwa (Limpopo Province, South Africa). A fixed-film reactor was used in the investigation, whereby the reactor was operated in the up-flow mode under fully submerged conditions at a recirculation ratio of, Qin/QR = 20. The performance of the bioreactor was evaluated over a range of influent U(VI) concentrations [75–100 mg U(VI)/L] and 24 h hydraulic retention time [HRT]. Complete U(VI) removal was observed in phases with 30–85 mg/L influent U(VI). When influent U(VI) was increased to 100 mg/L, approximately 60% U(VI) removal was achieved. The oxidation states of reduced uranium species were determined by Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy followed by X-ray Diffractometer (SEM/TEM-XRD). Earlier studies in batch systems showed that U(VI) was non-toxic to U(VI) reducing organisms at concentrations up to 400 mg/L. The decrease in U(VI) removal efficiency observed in the fixed-film reactor after 42 days was therefore attributed to the accumulation of U(IV) hydroxide precipitates in the reactor. Genetic identification using the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the species Kocuria turfanensis, Arthrobacter creatinolyticus, Bacillus licheniformis, and Microbacterium aerolatum survived from the original cultures. The feasibility of continuous removal of U(VI) in an inoculated indigenous culture system was thus demonstrated.",

Effects-Based Air Operations Planning Framework: A Knowledge-Based Simulation Approach.,"André N Costa, Paulo CG Costa",2016,Conference STIDS,"Planning air warfare operations has always been a complex endeavor. However, as technology evolves at an increasingly fast pace, so does the complexity of managing its resources. In modern air operations, planners have to deal with a highly changing environment influenced by enemy air defenses, weather forecasts, among many other factors, demanding much effort to handle the great number of constraints and uncertainties presented by them. As a result, a number of decision-support systems have emerged attempting to facilitate the planning of air warfare operations. These systems usually rely on a wide variety of methodologies, which sometimes present a challenge in themselves when it comes to assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of the produced plans. Computer simulations are a practical way of providing this assessment, usually by running the resulting plans multiple times and checking the results against key criteria. Yet, establishing the right criteria, properly accounting for the “fog of war,” and avoiding impractical simulation run times and costs are still major challenges. This paper addresses such challenges by proposing the development of a decisionsupport framework that combines ontology-based agile knowledge and a simulation-based mission planning methodology that accounts for the inherent uncertainties that air operations face. We avoid costly computation times required by simulationintensive course-of-action analyzers by initially pruning the solution space through ontological reasoning.

Agility through Automated Negotiation for C2 Services,"Jose B Neto, Michael R Hieb, Paulo Costa, Celso M Hirata",2014/6/1,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE IN COMMAND CONTROL COMMUNICATIONS COMPUTERS-INTELLIGENCE,"Command and Control C2 systems currently are developed for specific functions and limited application. Many systems deal with logistics and the management of resources during operations eg, Incident Response. Because different C2 systems often interoperate in very limited ways, they are difficult to get to work together without much manual intervention. This also limits the agility of operations due to the constraints of the automation used. However, Internet technologies have been developed to interoperate in a different way. Google and Amazon use web services that employ a Negotiation model to allow the development of very flexible responses to market conditions. There are many advantages to using negotiation protocols with automated systems. The traditional resource allocation process requires numerous meetings between representatives from the organizations involved to develop agreements. There are few tools available to assist in this process. We propose an innovative dynamic and agile methodology for supporting C2 using automated negotiation of electronic contracts e-contracts. These e-contracts can be implemented by commercial Web Services and provide an alternative to having to specify in advance all possible interactions between C2 systems. There is a main negotiation cycle where agreements are put into e-contracts prior to operations. During operations, e-contracts are invoked to perform rule-based transactions triggered by situational data.",
A Probabilistic Ontology Development Methodology,"Richard J Haberlin Jr, Paulo C da Costa, Kathryn B Laskey",2014/6/1,Publisher EMSOLUTIONS INC ARLINGTON VA,"The use of ontologies is on the rise, as they facilitate interoperability and provide support for automation. Today, ontologies are popular in areas such as the Semantic Web, knowledge engineering, Artificial Intelligence and knowledge management. However, many real world problems in these disciplines are burdened by incomplete information and other sources of uncertainty which traditional ontologies cannot represent. Therefore, a means to incorporate uncertainty is a necessity. Probabilistic ontologies extend current ontology formalisms to provide support for representing and reasoning with uncertainty. Traditional ontologies provide a hierarchical structure of entity classes and a formal way of expressing their relationships with first-order expressivity, which supports logical reasoning. However, they lack built-in, principled support to adequately account for uncertainty. Applying simple probability annotations to ontologies fails to convey the structure of the probabilistic representation. Similarly, other less expressive probability schemes do not convey the ontology structure, and are also inadequate. Representation of uncertainty in real-world problems requires probabilistic ontologies, which integrate the inferential reasoning power of probabilistic representations with the first-order expressivity of ontologies. Developing a probabilistic ontology is more complex than simply assigning probability to a class instantiation or representing a probability scheme using ontology constructs. Standard ontological engineering methods provide insufficient support for the complexity of probabilistic ontology development. Therefore, a specific methodology is …",

Description and assessment of a user oriented approach for asymmetric threat detection,"Valentina Dragos, Jürgen Ziegler, Paulo C Costa",2013/1/1,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA OFFICE OF SPONSORED PROGRAMS,"Asymmetric threats pose a difficult challenge to situational awareness systems. Current approaches for predicting or even detecting an asymmetric threat rely heavily on human knowledge, creating scalability issues due to the vast amount of data to be analyzed. Attempts to automate this process require a combination of advanced knowledge representation techniques to capture what human experts know about the domain and inferential reasoning approaches capable to work with incomplete, uncertain data. In our current research, we apply a verb-oriented ontology to capture actions, features, indicators, and other domain elements that are relevant to asymmetric threat detection. Then, these elements are input to a Bayesian network that will calculate the posterior probability of a threat given the input. As in any complex process, evaluation is a key asset for ensuring that nothing is neglected and partial results are consistent with the expectations. This paper describes our approach for asymmetric threat detection and emphasizes how we are leveraging the Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Evaluation framework URREF, to support its evaluation. We discuss how the sources of uncertainty are identified and how we assess its impact to the outcome of the detection system.",
Evaluating the Contribution of Uncertainty Management to a Fusion System,"Kathryn B Laskey, Paulo C Costa",2013/1/1,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA,"By its very nature, fusion requires managing uncertainty. While uncertainty management is built into many standard low-level fusion algorithms, and the importance of uncertainty management is widely recognized at all levels of the JDL hierarchy, there is less commonality of approaches to uncertainty management for high-level fusion. Evaluation of the contribution of uncertainty management to a fusion system is distinct from, although related to, evaluating the fusion system as a whole. The evaluation should consider the purpose for which fusion is being performed, and measure the contribution of uncertainty management to this purpose. The concept of expected value of sample information from decision theory provides a conceptual framework for thinking about the role of uncertainty management in fusion systems.",

Due to the relative availability of information, our approach automatically obtains a probabilistic measure of occurrence likelihood for the recognized geo-temporal phenomena. This measure, however, is not only used to find the best event among the merely possible candidates–witnessing the data (including photos), but it can also provide informative cues to human operators in the environments where uncertainty is involved in the existing knowledge.",

Of Starships and Klingons: Bayesian Logic for the 23rd Century,"Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, Paulo da Costa",2012/7,Journal arXiv e-prints,"Intelligent systems in an open world must reason about many interacting entities related to each other in diverse ways and having uncertain features and relationships. Traditional probabilistic languages lack the expressive power to handle relational domains. Classical first-order logic is sufficiently expressive, but lacks a coherent plausible reasoning capability. Recent years have seen the emergence of a variety of approaches to integrating first-order logic, probability, and machine learning. This paper presents Multi-entity Bayesian networks (MEBN), a formal system that integrates First Order Logic (FOL) with Bayesian probability theory. MEBN extends ordinary Bayesian networks to allow representation of graphical models with repeated sub-structures, and can express a probability distribution over models of any consistent, finitely axiomatizable first-order theory. We present the logic using an example inspired by …",

Semantics in course of action modeling and simulation,"Henrique C Marques, José MP de Oliveira, Paulo Cesar G da Costa",2010/10/17,Conference 2010 IEEE/ACM 14th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications,"Planning courses of action for a task force component involves analyzing a considerable amount of data, as well as assessing the available options and their respective impact to the operational goals. This is a time consuming process that is dramatically restricted by the currently established doctrine, which allocates a too short period for this task during its decision cycle. An inefficient COA planning generates losses of resources and compromises the ability of a force to achieve the desired effects in each mission. This study investigates the possibilities of using semantics to support courses of action modeling and simulation via a web services architecture. Our preliminary results indicate that with this semantics-based approach it is possible to automatically generate more than one course of action analysis on the basis of the commander´s intent in a timely manner.",

Bayesian Ontologies in Net-Centric Systems,"Blackmond Laskey, J Edward",2001/9/12,Journal Washington Post,"In today’s net-centric environment, there are new challenges to be met for any system to survive. Systems are required to fuse data from distributed, heterogeneous information sources operating asynchronously, to produce updated information, and to cope with diverse kinds of threats. Realizing this vision requires overcoming a number of technical challenges. Among these is the need for semantic interoperability among systems with different internal data models and vocabularies. Ontologies are seen as a key enabling technology for semantic interoperability, but current generation ontologies cannot represent or reason with incomplete data, a major shortcoming for Net-Centric systems. This paper proposes the use of probabilistic ontologies within a service-oriented architecture as a means to enable semantic interoperability in net-centric systems",
Enforcing Genetic Consent and Restrictions through a Privacy-Focused Ontology,"Michael Reep, Bo Yu, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo Costa","The use of genetic information has greatly expanded from the original focus of providing actionable data to health care providers and researchers for diagnostic and research purposes.

Federal and State Laws have been developed in the United States to improve privacy protections and prevent the misuse of genetic data. However, there is a wide variety of laws, regulations and restrictions governing the release criteria, level of protection required, and specificity in permitted use. The attribute-focused component of these laws matches information regarding the requester, genetic contributor with the purpose and data being released to come up with an access decision. While the attribute-based portion is easily implemented, there are numerous aspects in the laws and regulations that require more complex decision making, dictate further post-release restrictions, and specific directives for consents.

Assessing uncertainty handling representations of HLIF systems with URREF,"MARK LOCHER, PAULO COSTA","This paper describes the use of the Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Evaluation Framework (URREF) in evaluating an information fusion system’s ability to appropriately handle the various uncertainties that arise in the fusion process. Information fusion transforms information from different sources and different points in time into a unified representation that supports human or automated decision-making [8]. This decision-making focus demands that information fusion results are sound. Unfortunately, data sources used are often “inconclusive, ambiguous, incomplete, unreliable and dissonant”[59]. It is important to evaluate the different forms of uncertainty a fusion system has to deal with, where and how they occur, and the impact they have on the fusion processes and system outputs. The URREF provides a set of uncertainty definitions and evaluation criteria to support such an evaluation.

19th ICCRTS–C2 Agility: Lessons Learned from Research and Operations,"LTC Jose B Neto, Michael R Hieb, Paulo Costa, Celso Massaki Hirata","Command and Control (C2) systems currently are developed for specific functions and limited application. Many systems deal with logistics and the management of resources during operations (eg, Incident Response).

This also limits the agility of operations due to the constraints of the automation used. However, Internet technologies have been developed to interoperate in a different way. Google and Amazon use web services that employ a “Negotiation” model to allow the development of very flexible responses to market conditions.There are many advantages to using negotiation protocols with automated systems. The traditional resource allocation process requires numerous meetings between representatives from the organizations involved to develop agreements. There are few tools available to assist in this process. We propose an innovative dynamic and agile methodology for supporting C2 using automated negotiation of electronic contracts (e-contracts). These e-contracts can be implemented by commercial Web Services and provide an alternative to having to specify in advance all possible interactions between C2 systems. There is a main negotiation cycle where agreements are put into e-contracts prior to operations.

Effects-Based Air Operations Planning Framework,"André N Costa, Paulo CG Costa","Planning air warfare operations has always been a complex endeavor. However, as technology evolves at an increasingly fast pace, so does the complexity of managing its resources. In modern air operations, planners have to deal with a highly changing environment influenced by enemy air defenses, weather forecasts, among many other factors, demanding much effort to handle the great number of constraints and uncertainties presented by them. As a result, a number of decision-support systems have emerged attempting to facilitate the planning of air warfare operations. These systems usually rely on a wide variety of methodologies, which sometimes present a challenge in themselves when it comes to assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of the produced plans. Computer simulations are a practical way of providing this assessment, usually by running the resulting plans multiple times and checking the results against key criteria. Yet, establishing the right criteria, properly accounting for the “fog of war,” and avoiding impractical simulation run times and costs are still major challenges. This paper addresses such challenges by proposing the development of a decisionsupport framework that combines ontology-based agile knowledge and a simulation-based mission planning methodology that accounts for the inherent uncertainties that air operations face. We avoid costly computation times required by simulationintensive course-of-action analyzers by initially pruning the solution space through ontological reasoning.

These systems usually rely on a wide variety of methodologies, which sometimes present a challenge in themselves when it comes to assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of the produced plans. Computer simulations are a practical way of providing this assessment, usually by running the resulting plans multiple times and checking the results against key criteria. Yet, establishing the right criteria, properly accounting for the “fog of war,” and avoiding impractical simulation run times and costs are still major challenges. This paper addresses such challenges by proposing the development of a decisionsupport framework that combines ontology-based agile knowledge and a simulation-based mission planning methodology that accounts for the inherent uncertainties that air operations face. We avoid costly computation times required by simulationintensive course-of-action analyzers by initially pruning the solution space through ontological reasoning. Moreover, the approach complies with the Effects-Based Approach to Operations, having a clear correspondence of …",
Toward Representing and Recognizing Cyber-Physical Elements in Competition Using Event Semantics,"Alonza Mumford, Duminda Wijesekera, Paulo Costa","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is observing an increasing number of incidents involving recreational drones, and imagining a future where every drone will be equipped with an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) transponder that communicates and cooperates with the FAA’s Next Generation (NextGen) Aviation Cyber-Physical System in order to help mitigate aerial collision risk [1]. This exemplar application involves human or autonomous agents interacting within some sort of cyber-physical system where competition or cooperation between cyber-physical elements exist. We anticipate that the use of higher-level abstractions will be required for modeling human or autonomous agent’s interactions within these type of systems in order to make sense of the observations derived from sensor-data. In this paper, we articulate an approach that uses event semantics to represent the temporal, spatial, factor, and outcome features of activities generated by competing or cooperating agents functioning within a cyber-physical environment. We use those semantics, along with observations of activity, to model higher-level activity abstractions and to help perform strategy recognition from a concrete, competition-oriented scenario reflected in a real-world, game data set comprised of more than a half million events involving nearly 8500 unique agents. The strength of the approach is grounded in a specification of event semantics for our concrete multi-agent, competitive game ontology using Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS) and Ontology Web Language (OWL).

HYPOTHESIS MANAGEMENT,"Richard Haberlin, Paulo Cesar G da Costa, Kathryn B Laskey","Situational awareness supports tactical decision making through fusion of information about intelligence, geography, environment, and the geopolitical situation. Advanced decision support systems can help decision makers explore hypotheses about the evolving situation. Computational resources place limits on the number of hypotheses that can be considered. Hypothesis Management controls the exponential growth in fusion hypotheses created by a deluge of reports. This paper describes the Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach used to develop a Hypothesis Management Module as part of the Office of Naval Research Probabilistic Ontologies for net-Centric Operations Systems (PROGNOS) project. Specifically, a top-down design process was employed utilizing the Object Management Group Systems Modeling Language. After a brief introduction to the PROGNOS project, a systematic description of the MBSE methodology is provided.","Scholar articles HYPOTHESIS MANAGEMENTR Haberlin, PCG da Costa, KB LaskeyRelated articles All 4 versions ","Situational awareness supports tactical decision making through fusion of information about intelligence, geography, environment, and the geopolitical situation.

When I asked her to be my advisor I already knew she was an outstanding professor and gifted researcher. However, as we worked together I began to realize how incredibly fortunate I was to have also met a mentor, co-author, and friend. She not only guided me through the many areas of knowledge I had to visit, but also showed a sensibility that few possess in pushing an advisee to achieve way beyond what he thought he could ever do.

15th ICCRTS,"Henrique Costa Marques, José Maria P de Oliveira, Paulo Cesar G da Costa","In an environment where there exists collaboration among armed forces and multiple agencies, ensuring interoperability among C 2 systems demands a scalable architecture that is also secure while still supportive for the discovery of newly available services. These requirements have been verified on real-life scenarios by the Brazilian armed forces, which were structured for conventional conflicts but had to face different C 2 environments when participating in humanitarian relief operations. In such situations, the tasks to be executed in a short period need to be planned from an operational view and, whenever possible, maximizing the efficiency of the available resources. Achieving these objectives while operating under a C 2 structure that was not originally designed for interoperating with the many players usually involved in such environment is a major liability to the Brazilian armed forces. This paper presents a proposal for a C 2 architecture currently being development to address this limitation. Although the research focus is on the Joint Forces Air Component, the approach might be applied to different C 2 structures. The first results showed the need for a set of measures to be adopted by the operational sector of the Brazilian Ministry of Defense, which we also address in this work.","Scholar articles 15th ICCRTSHC Marques, JMP de Oliveira, PCG da CostaRelated articles All 5 versions ","In an environment where there exists collaboration among armed forces and multiple agencies, ensuring interoperability among C 2 systems demands a scalable architecture that is also secure while still supportive for the discovery of newly available services.
