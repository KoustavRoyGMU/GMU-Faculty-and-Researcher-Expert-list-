Phoretic self-propulsion,"Jeffrey L Moran, Jonathan D Posner",2017/1/3,Source Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics,"It is well-known that micro- and nanoparticles can move by phoretic effects in response to externally imposed gradients of scalar quantities such as chemical concentration or electric potential. A class of active colloids can propel themselves through aqueous media by generating local gradients of concentration and electrical potential via surface reactions. Phoretic active colloids can be controlled using external stimuli and can mimic collective behaviors exhibited by many biological swimmers. Low–Reynolds number physicochemical hydrodynamics imposes unique challenges and constraints that must be understood for the practical potential of active colloids to be realized. Here, we review the rich physics underlying the operation of phoretic active colloids, describe their interactions and collective behaviors, and discuss promising directions for future research.",286
Electrokinetic locomotion due to reaction-induced charge auto-electrophoresis,"Jeffrey L Moran, Jonathan D Posner",2011/8,Journal Journal of Fluid Mechanics,"Mitchell originally proposed that an asymmetric ion flux across an organism's membrane could generate electric fields that drive locomotion. Although this locomotion mechanism was later rejected for some species of bacteria, engineered Janus particles have been realized that can swim due to ion fluxes generated by asymmetric electrochemical reactions. Here we present governing equations, scaling analyses and numerical simulations that describe the motion of bimetallic rod-shaped motors in hydrogen peroxide solutions due to reaction-induced charge auto-electrophoresis. The coupled Poisson–Nernst–Planck–Stokes equations are numerically solved using Frumkin-corrected Butler–Volmer equations to represent electrochemical reactions at the rod surface.

Rapid fabrication of bimetallic spherical motors,"Philip M Wheat, Nathan A Marine, Jeffrey L Moran, Jonathan D Posner",2010/8/17,Journal Langmuir,"Catalytic bimetallic nanomotors can swim at 100 body lengths per second as well as pick up, haul, and release micrometer-scale cargo. The electrokinetic locomotion of bimetallic nanomotors is driven by the electrocatalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The motors are typically fabricated by electrodeposition-based template synthesis techniques that result in heterogeneous samples and require specialized knowledge of electrochemistry, a three-electrode potentiostat setup, cyanide-based chemistry, and porous membranes. This paper presents a rapid and facile method for fabrication of spherical bimetallic motors that only requires access to metal deposition equipment and commercially available microspheres.

In this work a rapid microfluidic assay was developed to determine the critical electric field threshold required for inducing bacterial electroporation. The microfluidic device was designed to have a bilaterally converging channel to amplify the electric field to magnitudes sufficient to induce electroporation. The bacterial cells are introduced into the channel in the presence of SYTOX®, which fluorescently labels cells with compromised membranes. Upon delivery of an electric pulse, the cells fluoresce due to transmembrane influx of SYTOX® after disruption of the cell membranes. We calculate the critical electric field by capturing the location within the channel of the increase in fluorescence intensity after electroporation.

Role of solution conductivity in reaction induced charge auto-electrophoresis,"Jeffrey L Moran, Jonathan D Posner",2014/4/1,Journal Physics of Fluids,"Catalytic bimetallic Janus particles swim by a bipolar electrochemical propulsion mechanism that results from electroosmotic fluid slip around the particle surface. The flow is driven by electrical body forces which are generated from a coupling of a reaction-induced electric field and net charge in the diffuse layer surrounding the particle.

The simulations solve the full Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations with multiple ionic species, a cylindrical particle in an infinite fluid, and nonlinear Butler-Volmer boundary conditions to represent the electrochemical surface reactions.

A practical guide to active colloids: choosing synthetic model systems for soft matter physics research,"Wei Wang, Xianglong Lv, Jeffrey L Moran, Shifang Duan, Chao Zhou",2020,Source Soft Matter,"Synthetic active colloids that harvest energy stored in the environment and swim autonomously are a popular model system for active matter. This emerging field of research sits at the intersection of materials chemistry, soft matter physics, and engineering, and thus cross-talk among researchers from different backgrounds becomes critical yet difficult. To facilitate this interdisciplinary communication, and to help soft matter physicists with choosing the best model system for their research, we here present a tutorial review article that describes, in appropriate detail, six experimental systems of active colloids commonly found in the physics literature. For each type, we introduce their background, material synthesis and operating mechanisms and notable studies from the soft matter community, and comment on their respective advantages and limitations.

The identification and utilization of new resistance sources is critical to the continued development of improved cultivars as shifts in pathogen races cause the effectiveness of widely deployed genes to be short lived. The objectives of this research were to identify and tag new leaf rust resistance genes. Forty landraces from Afghanistan and Iran were obtained from the National Plant Germplasm System and evaluated under field conditions at two locations in Texas.

Confocal microscopy provides optical sectioning using pinhole spatial filtering which rejects light originating from out-of-focus objects. The system accomplishes volumetric scanning by rapid translation of the high numerical aperture objective using a piezo objective positioner. The motion of fluorescent microspheres is quantified using 3D3C super resolution particle-imaging velocimetry with instantaneous spatial resolutions of the order of 5 µm or less in all three dimensions.

Nonlinear electrophoresis of ideally polarizable particles,"Bruno Figliuzzi, Wai Hong Ronald Chan, JL Moran, Cullen R Buie",2014/10/9,Journal Physics of Fluids,"We focus in this paper on the nonlinear electrophoresis of ideally polarizable particles. At high applied voltages, significant ionic exchange occurs between the electric double layer, which surrounds the particle, and the bulk solution. In addition, steric effects due to the finite size of ions drastically modify the electric potential distribution in the electric double layer. In this situation, the velocity field, the electric potential, and the ionic concentration in the immediate vicinity of the particle are described by a complicated set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. In the general case, these equations must be solved numerically. In this study, we rely on a numerical approach to determine the electric potential, the ionic concentration, and the velocity field in the bulk solution surrounding the particle. The numerical simulations rely on a pseudo-spectral method which was used successfully by Chu and Bazant [J …",18
Noble-gas-infused neoprene closed-cell foams achieving ultra-low thermal conductivity fabrics,"Jeffrey L Moran, Anton L Cottrill, Jesse D Benck, Pingwei Liu, Zhe Yuan, Michael S Strano, Jacopo Buongiorno",2018,Journal RSC advances,"Closed-cell foams are widely applied as insulation and essential for the thermal management of protective garments for extreme environments. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a strategy for drastically reducing the thermal conductivity of a flexible, closed-cell polychloroprene foam to 0.031 ± 0.002 W m−1 K−1, approaching values of an air gap (0.027 W m−1 K−1) for an extended period of time (>10 hours), within a material capable of textile processing. Ultra-insulating neoprene materials are synthesized using high-pressure processing at 243 kPa in a high-molecular-weight gas environment, such as Ar, Kr, or Xe. A Fickian diffusion model describes both the mass infusion and thermal conductivity reduction of the foam as a function of processing time, predicting a 24–72 hour required exposure time for full charging of a 6 mm thick 5 cm diameter neoprene sample.

Nonlinear electrophoresis in the presence of dielectric decrement,"Bruno Figliuzzi, WHR Chan, CR Buie, JL Moran",2016/8/30,Journal Physical Review E,"The nonlinear phenomena that occur in the electric double layer (EDL) that forms at charged surfaces strongly influence electrokinetic effects, including electro-osmosis and electrophoresis. In particular, saturation effects due to either dielectric decrement or ion crowding effects are of paramount importance. Dielectric decrement significantly influences the ionic concentration in the EDL at high ζ potential, leading to the formation of a condensed layer near the particle's surface. In this article, we present a model incorporating both steric effects due to the finite size of ions and dielectric decrement to describe the physics in the electric double layer. The model remains valid in both weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes, as long as the electric double layer remains in quasiequilibrium. We apply this model to the study of two archetypal problems in electrokinetics, namely the electrophoresis of particles with fixed surface …",13
Generic rules for distinguishing autophoretic colloidal motors,"Yixin Peng, Pengzhao Xu, Shifang Duan, Jiayu Liu, Jeffrey Lawrence Moran, Wei Wang",2022/3/14,Journal Angewandte Chemie,"Distinguishing the operating mechanisms of nano‐ and micromotors powered by chemical gradients, i.e. “autophoresis”, holds the key for fundamental and applied reasons. In this article, we propose and experimentally confirm that the speeds of a self‐diffusiophoretic colloidal motor scale inversely to its population density but not for self‐electrophoretic motors, because the former is an ion source and thus increases the solution ionic strength over time while the latter does not. They also form clusters in visually distinguishable and quantifiable ways. This pair of rules is simple, powerful, and insensitive to the specific material composition, shape or size of a colloidal motor, and does not require any measurement beyond typical microscopy. These rules are not only useful in clarifying the operating mechanisms of typical autophoretic micromotors, but also in predicting the dynamics of unconventional ones that are yet …",11
Numerical study of the effect of soft layer properties on bacterial electroporation,"Jeffrey L Moran, Naga Neehar Dingari, Paulo A Garcia, Cullen R Buie",2018/10/1,Journal Bioelectrochemistry,"We present a numerical model of electroporation in a gram-positive bacterium, which accounts for the presence of a negatively charged soft polyelectrolyte layer (which may include a periplasmic space, peptidoglycan layer, cilia, flagella, and other surface appendages) surrounding its plasma membrane. We model the ion transport within and outside the soft layer using the soft layer electrokinetics-based Poisson-Nernst-Planck formalism. Additionally, we model the electroporation dynamics on the plasma membrane using the pore nucleation-based electroporation formalism developed by Krassowska and Filev. We find that ion transport within the soft layer (surface conduction), which depends on the relative importance of the soft layer charged group concentration compared to the buffer concentration, significantly alters the transmembrane voltage across the plasma membrane and hence the pore characteristics …",11
Designing chemical micromotors that communicate-A survey of experiments,"Luyang Huang, Jeffrey L Moran, Wei Wang",2021/7/1,Source JCIS Open,"Micromotors that communicate with their neighbors or with the environment are useful in a wide variety of applications, especially those involving complicated tasks that require coordination. A biomimetic strategy for achieving this goal is via chemical communication, where chemical signals released from one motor is transmitted through the medium and induce a specific response from a second motor. In this article, we review the recent experimental progress on this front. We first introduce three common strategies for releasing chemicals from a microscopic object, via diffusion, physical/chemical stimuli, or gated control, that form the cornerstone for designing communicating micromotors. We then review three levels of chemical communication of micromotors in order of ascending complexity, starting with cases where micromotors attract or repel inert tracers, to the unidirectional signal transmission between two …",9

Chemokinesis-driven accumulation of active colloids in low-mobility regions of fuel gradients,"Jeffrey L Moran, Philip M Wheat, Nathan A Marine, Jonathan D Posner",2021/2/26,Journal Scientific Reports,"Many motile cells exhibit migratory behaviors, such as chemotaxis (motion up or down a chemical gradient) or chemokinesis (dependence of speed on chemical concentration), which enable them to carry out vital functions including immune response, egg fertilization, and predator evasion. These have inspired researchers to develop self-propelled colloidal analogues to biological microswimmers, known as active colloids, that perform similar feats. Here, we study the behavior of half-platinum half-gold (Pt/Au) self-propelled rods in antiparallel gradients of hydrogen peroxide fuel and salt, which tend to increase and decrease the rods’ speed, respectively. Brownian Dynamics simulations, a Fokker–Planck theoretical model, and experiments demonstrate that, at steady state, the rods accumulate in low-speed (salt-rich, peroxide-poor) regions not because of chemotaxis, but because of chemokinesis.

Electrokinetic locomotion,Jeffrey Lawrence Moran,2013/7/25,"Description The past decade has seen the rapid development of synthetic particles capable of propelling themselves at the micro- and nanometer scale through aqueous media.

However, alongside this progress, the need has arisen to understand the physical mechanisms governing their motion, as well as the limitations on their capabilities.  Explanations of the propulsion mechanisms driving synthetic nanomotors are critical not only for providing insight into novel physical phenomena, but also to guide and inform the design and implementation of nanomotors and nanomachines. Bimetallic rods, 2 microns in length, were first shown to move autonomously using hydrogen peroxide fuel in 2004. Since then, a number of theories have been proposed to explain how these particles convert chemical energy in the hydrogen peroxide to kinetic energy of motion.

Autonomously Propelled Colloids for Penetration and Payload Delivery in Complex Extracellular Matrices,"Shrishti Singh, Jeffrey L Moran",2021/10/6,Source Micromachines,"For effective treatment of diseases such as cancer or fibrosis, it is essential to deliver therapeutic agents such as drugs to the diseased tissue, but these diseased sites are surrounded by a dense network of fibers, cells, and proteins known as the extracellular matrix (ECM).

Due to catalytic electrochemical reactions on Pt and Au, hydrogen ions (H+) are generated and depleted on opposite sides of the membrane, establishing a self-generated electric field and associated electro-osmotic flow through the pores. By optimizing the pore radius, EDL overlap is avoided and an area-averaged self-pumping flow speed of 23 µm/s can be achieved, which is 20 times higher than previously reported.

Self-Pumping Nanoporous Membranes Driven by Asymmetric Electrocatalytic Reactions,"Jeffrey Moran, Yuhang Fang, David Warsinger",2021,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"When two dissimilar metals are electrically connected in the presence of an aqueous solution, they can generate spontaneous fluid flows that result in either self-propulsion of freely suspended bimetallic particles, or fluid pumping if the metals are immobilized onto a solid surface. In the latter case, this can lead to novel phenomena such as catalytic micropumps. We present a numerical model of a membrane containing nanoscale cylindrical pores with platinum (Pt) coated onto one surface and gold (Au) on the opposite surface. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, electrochemical charge-transfer reactions occur on each metal that result in a concentration gradient of protons, which in turn generates an electric field that drives electroosmotic flows through the pores.

The latter technique is particularly interesting for space applications, where the electric field is used to create a body force that compensates for the absence of gravity.

However, application of the same theory to bacterial electroporation presents significant challenges because of the presence of charged soft layers around bacteria. The soft layer charge distribution has been found to significantly influence bacterial electrophoretic mobility and polarizability because it alters the electric potential spatial distribution around the cell envelope. In addition, the RC charging time scale of both the soft layer and electric double layer is of the order of microseconds, which is also of similar order of magnitude as the pore creation time scale.

Once we find the optimal Re and We to create a planar interface in the channel, we apply an electric field across the interface for EPD of CNTs and/or silver (Ag) nanorods dispersed in water. During EPD, particles migrate to the oil/water interface, where cross-linking of polymers is induced to form composite hydrogel membranes. Properties of the composite hydrogel films are controlled by electric fields, CNT concentrations, and …",
Dielectric Decrement Effects on Nonlinear Electrophoresis of Ideally Polarizable Particles,"Jeffrey L Moran, Wai Hong Ronald Chan, Cullen R Buie, Bruno Figliuzzi",2014/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"We present numerical simulations of nonlinear electrophoresis of ideally polarizable particles that specifically include the effects of a spatially non-uniform dielectric permittivity near the particle surface. Models for this dielectric decrement phenomenon have been developed by several authors, including Ben-Yaakov et al.[J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 2009] Hatlo et al.[EPL 2012], and Zhao & Zhai [JFM 2013]. We extend this work to ideally polarizable particles and include the effects of surface conduction and advective transport in the electric double layer. By numerically solving for the coupled velocity field, electric potential, and ionic concentration distributions in the bulk solution surrounding the particle, we demonstrate that the dielectric decrement model predicts ionic saturation around the particle and thus physical implications that resemble those resulting from the steric model developed by Kilic et al.[PRE 2007 …",
Supplementary Information for “Role of Solution Conductivity in Reaction Induced Charge Auto-Electrophoresis”,"Jeffrey L Moran, Jonathan D Posner",2014/2/26,"Description ,(1) where h is the length of the rod. The scaling analysis thus predicts that the speed of the rods scales with rod length. Figure S1 validates this prediction. Fig. S1 shows that both electric fields measured in this work do increase with increasing rod length. Our model does not account for some factors that could slow the rods down with increasing length. For example, the increase in mass of the rods with length could result in swimming closer to the bottom surface of the well which would result in increased viscous drag with the solid surface and a likely reduction in swimming speed. All of these simulations were run with inert bulk electrolyte concentration set to zero, although similar trends would emerge at any other conductivity as long as it is kept constant.",",(1) where h is the length of the rod.

Role of Background Electrolyte in Electrokinetic Locomotion by Reaction-Induced Charge Auto-Electrophoresis,"Jeffrey L Moran, Jonathan D Posner",2011/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"Bimetallic particles propel themselves through aqueous solutions by harvesting chemical energy from hydrogen peroxide fuel and converting it to fluid motion through reaction-induced charge auto-electrophoresis. We present a scaling analysis and computational simulations that describe the physics underlying the locomotion of these particles. The model shows that the motion results from electrical body forces in the surrounding fluid, which are generated by a coupling of an asymmetric dipolar charge density distribution and the electric field it generates. The simulations and scaling analysis make the predictions, in agreement with experiments, that the speed of the autonomous motion depends linearly on fuel concentration and particle surface charge and inversely on solution conductivity.",

Electrokinetic locomotion by reaction induced charge auto-electrophoresis,"Jonathan D Posner, Jeffery L Moran",2011/3/27,Conference ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY,"The controlled motion of synthetic nanoscale motors may represent a major step towards the development of practical nanomachines, artificial cells, and autonomous microsystems. We are investigating locomotion of bimetallic synthetic nanomotors that, analogous to their biological counterparts, harvest chemical energy from their local environment and convert it to useful work. Bimetallic nanorods can autonomously propel themselves at a hundred body lengths per second through aqueous solutions by using hydrogen peroxide as a fuel. We can control the motion of nanomotors using magnetic fields and chemical species to control the motion of Pt-Ni-Au nanorods.",
Directed locomotion of bimetallic synthetic nanomotors,"Jonathan Posner, Philip Wheat, Jeffrey Moran, Christine Burdett, J Burdick, R Laocharoensuk, P Calvo-Marzal, K Manesh, D Kagan, S Balasubramanian, M Cardona, G-U Flechsig, Joe Wang",2009/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"Controlled motion of synthetic nanoscale motors may represent a major step towards the development of practical nanomachines and autonomous microsystems. Bimetallic nanorods can autonomously propel themselves at hundred of body lengths per second through aqueous solutions by using hydrogen peroxide as a fuel. The magnetic and chemical controlled motion of Pt-Ni-Au nanorods is presented. The magnetic properties of nickel-loaded nanomotors offer controlled cargo manipulations, including en-route load, drag and release of spherical cargo that have volumes two orders of magnitude larger than the nanomotors itself. Nanomotors can be directed through microfluidic channel networks and motion triggered using locally generated chemical species. The nanomotor locomotion force is determined by measuring the velocity of motors towing spherical cargo. The nanomotors approximately generate 0.16 …",
Locomotion of a rod-shaped nanomotor propelled by heterogeneous catalytic reactions,"Jeffrey Moran, Jonathan Posner",2009/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"Bimetallic nanorods can autonomously propel themselves through aqueous solutions by using hydrogen peroxide as a fuel. Several physical arguments have been proposed to describe the physics underlying the chemically-powered locomotion of these synthetic nanomotors, but there is no accepted or detailed theory on the propulsion mechanism. A computational simulation and scaling analysis of rod-shaped nanoparticles with asymmetric surface fluxes is presented. The model shows that locomotion is driven by electric body forces that arise due to finite space charge and internally generated electric fields surrounding the rod. The electric fields and charge density are generated by dipolar cation fluxes, such as those generated by heterogeneous electrochemical reactions. The scaling analysis and detailed simulations predict that the nanomotor velocity depends on the reaction flux, nanorod electrical surface …",
