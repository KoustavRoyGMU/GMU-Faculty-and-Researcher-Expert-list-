Energy-efficient target coverage in wireless sensor networks based on modified ant colony algorithm,"Salma Begum, Nazma Tara, Sharmin Sultana",2010/12,"Journal International Journal of Ad hoc, Sensor & Ubiquitous Computing","One of the major issues in Target-coverage problem of wireless sensor network is to increase the network lifetime. This can be solved by selecting minimum working nodes that will cover all the targets. This paper proposes a completely new method, in which minimum working node is selected by modified Ant colony Algorithm. Experimental results show that the lever of algorithmic complication is depressed and the searching time is reduced, and the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithm in terms.",31
Enhanced-DSR: a new approach to improve performance of DSR algorithm,"Sharmin Sultana, Salma Begum, Nazma Tara, Ahsan Raja Chowdhury",2010/4,Journal International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology,"High overhead involved in flooding while route creation is a limiting factor of Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol applied for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). During data delivery, it seems that we fully benefit from DSR if the route is not long enough. In this paper, we propose two modifications of DSR algorithm to enhance its performance. In the modified approach of DSR, to reduce broadcasting overhead, multicasting approach is used. Again, for shortening packet length, in case of longer route, the route is truncated after a predetermined number of hops. Some simulations show that the new modified algorithm (Enhanced DSR) performs better than the DSR algorithm.",21
MRI-based medial axis extraction and boundary segmentation of cranial nerves through discrete deformable 3D contour and surface models,"Sharmin Sultana, Jason E Blatt, Benjamin Gilles, Tanweer Rashid, Michel A Audette",2017/4/12,Journal IEEE transactions on medical imaging,"This paper presents a segmentation technique to identify the medial axis and the boundary of cranial nerves. We utilize a 3-D deformable one-simplex discrete contour model to extract the medial axis of each cranial nerve. This contour model represents a collection of two-connected vertices linked by edges, where vertex position is determined by a Newtonian expression for vertex kinematics featuring internal and external forces, the latter of which include attractive forces toward the nerve medial axis. We exploit multiscale vesselness filtering and minimal path techniques in the medial axis extraction method, which also computes a radius estimate along the path. Once we have the medial axis and the radius function of a nerve, we identify the nerve surface using a two-simplex deformable model, which expands radially and can accommodate any nerve shape. As a result, the method proposed here combines the …",14
CNN-based hierarchical coarse-to-fine segmentation of pelvic CT images for prostate cancer radiotherapy,"Sharmin Sultana, Adam Robinson, Daniel Y Song, Junghoon Lee",2020/3/16,"Conference Medical Imaging 2020: Image-Guided Procedures, Robotic Interventions, and Modeling","Accurate segmentation of organs-at-risk is important in prostate cancer radiation therapy planning. However, poor soft tissue contrast in CT makes the segmentation task very challenging. We propose a deep convolutional neural network approach to automatically segment the prostate, bladder, and rectum from pelvic CT. A hierarchical coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy is used where the first step generates a coarse segmentation from which an organ-specific region of interest (ROI) localization map is produced. The second step produces detailed and accurate segmentation of the organs. The ROI localization map is generated using a 3D U-net. The localization map helps adjusting the ROI of each organ that needs to be segmented and hence improves computational efficiency by eliminating irrelevant background information. For the fine segmentation step, we designed a fully convolutional network (FCN) by …",11
Automatic multi-organ segmentation in computed tomography images using hierarchical convolutional neural network,"Sharmin Sultana, Adam Robinson, Daniel Y Song, Junghoon Lee",2020/9/1,Journal Journal of Medical Imaging,"Purpose: Accurate segmentation of treatment planning computed tomography (CT) images is important for radiation therapy (RT) planning.

Towards a statistical shape-aware deformable contour model for cranial nerve identification,"Sharmin Sultana, Praful Agrawal, Shireen Y Elhabian, Ross T Whitaker, Tanweer Rashid, Jason E Blatt, Justin S Cetas, Michel A Audette",2016,"Conference Clinical Image-Based Procedures. Translational Research in Medical Imaging: 5th International Workshop, CLIP 2016, Held in Conjunction with MICCAI 2016, Athens, Greece, October 17, 2016, Proceedings 5"," This paper presents a cranial nerve segmentation technique that combines a 3D deformable contour and a 3D contour Statistical Shape Model (SSM). A set of training data for the construction of the 3D contour shape model is produced using a 1-simplex based discrete deformable contour model where the centerline identification proceeds by optimizing internal and external forces. Point-correspondence for the training dataset is performed using an entropy-based energy minimization of particles on the centerline curve. The resulting average shape is used as a prior knowledge, which is incorporated into the 1-simplex as a reference shape model, making the approach stable against low resolution and image artifacts during segmentation using MRI data. Shape variability is shown using the first 3 modes of variation. The segmentation result is validated quantitatively, with ground truth provided by an expert.",7
Watertight and 2-manifold surface meshes using dual contouring with tetrahedral decomposition of grid cubes,"Tanweer Rashid, Sharmin Sultana, Michel A Audette",2016/1/1,Journal Procedia engineering,"The Dual Contouring algorithm (DC) is a grid-based process used to generate surface meshes from volumetric data. The advantage of DC is that it can reproduce sharp features by inserting vertices anywhere inside the grid cube, as opposed to the Marching Cubes (MC) algorithm that can insert vertices only on the grid edges. However, DC is unable to guarantee 2-manifold and watertight meshes due to the fact that it produces only one vertex for each grid cube. We present a modified Dual Contouring algorithm that is capable of overcoming this limitation. Our method decomposes an ambiguous grid cube into a maximum of twelve tetrahedral cells; we introduce novel polygon generation rules that produce 2-manifold and watertight surface meshes. We have applied our proposed method on realistic data, and a comparison of the results of our proposed method with results from traditional DC shows the …",6
A deformable multimodal image registration using PET/CT and TRUS for intraoperative focal prostate brachytherapy,"Sharmin Sultana, Daniel Y Song, Junghoon Lee",2019/3/8,"Conference Medical Imaging 2019: Image-Guided Procedures, Robotic Interventions, and Modeling","In this paper, a deformable registration method is proposed that enables automatic alignment of preoperative PET/CT to intraoperative ultrasound in order to achieve PET-determined focal prostate brachytherapy. Novel PET imaging agents such as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) enables highly accurate identification of intra/extra-prostatic tumors. Incorporation of PSMA PET into the standard transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate brachytherapy will enable focal therapy, thus minimizing radiation toxicities. Our registration method requires PET/CT and TRUS volume as well as prostate segmentations. These input volumes are first rigidly registered by maximizing spatial overlap between the segmented prostate volumes, followed by the deformable registration. To achieve anatomically accurate deformable registration, we extract anatomical landmarks from both prostate boundary and inside the …",5
Patient-specific cranial nerve identification using a discrete deformable contour model for skull base neurosurgery planning and simulation,"Sharmin Sultana, Jason E Blatt, Yueh Lee, Matthew Ewend, Justin S Cetas, Anthony Costa, Michel A Audette",2016,"Conference Clinical Image-Based Procedures. Translational Research in Medical Imaging: 4th International Workshop, CLIP 2015, Held in Conjunction with MICCAI 2015, Munich, Germany, October 5, 2015. Revised Selected Papers 4","In this paper, we present a minimally supervised method for the identification of the intra-cranial portion of cranial nerves, using a novel, discrete 1-Simplex 3D active contour model. The clinical applications include planning and personalized simulation of skull base neurosurgery. The centerline of a cranial nerve is initialized from two user-supplied end points by computing a Minimal Path. The 1-Simplex is a Newtonian model for vertex motion, where every non-endpoint vertex has 2-connectivity with neighboring vertices, with which it is linked by edges. The segmentation behavior of the model is governed by the equilibrium between internal and external forces. The external forces include an image force that favors a centered path within high-vesselness points. The method is validated quantitatively using synthetic and real MRI datasets.",5
Deformable registration of PET/CT and ultrasound for disease-targeted focal prostate brachytherapy,"Sharmin Sultana, Daniel Y Song, Junghoon Lee",2019/7/1,Journal Journal of Medical Imaging,"We propose a deformable registration algorithm for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion. Accurate registration of PSMA PET to intraoperative TRUS will allow physicians to customize dose planning based on the regions involved. The inputs to the registration algorithm are the PET/CT and TRUS volumes as well as the prostate segmentations. PET/CT and TRUS volumes are first rigidly registered by maximizing the overlap between the segmented prostate binary masks. Three-dimensional anatomical landmarks are then automatically extracted from the boundary as well as within the prostate. Then, a deformable registration is performed using a regularized thin plate spline where the landmark localization error is optimized between the extracted landmarks that are in correspondence. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on 25 prostate cancer patients …",4

Development of an atlas-based segmentation of cranial nerves using shape-aware discrete deformable models for neurosurgical planning and simulation,Sharmin Sultana,2017,Institution Old Dominion University,"Twelve pairs of cranial nerves arise from the brain or brainstem and control our sensory functions such as vision, hearing, smell and taste as well as several motor functions to the head and neck including facial expressions and eye movement. Often, these cranial nerves are difficult to detect in MRI data, and thus represent problems in neurosurgery planning and simulation, due to their thin anatomical structure, in the face of low imaging resolution as well as image artifacts. As a result, they may be at risk in neurosurgical procedures around the skull base, which might have dire consequences such as the loss of eyesight or hearing and facial paralysis. Consequently, it is of great importance to clearly delineate cranial nerves in medical images for avoidance in the planning of neurosurgical procedures and for targeting in the treatment of cranial nerve disorders. In this research, we propose to develop a digital atlas …",3
"Deformable multi-material 2-simplex surface mesh for intraoperative MRI-ready surgery planning and simulation, with deep-brain stimulation applications","Tanweer Rashid, Sharmin Sultana, Gregory S Fischer, Julie Pilitsis, Michel A Audette",2017,"Conference Imaging for Patient-Customized Simulations and Systems for Point-of-Care Ultrasound: International Workshops, BIVPCS 2017 and POCUS 2017, Held in Conjunction with MICCAI 2017, Québec City, QC, Canada, September 14, 2017, Proceedings"," Printed and/or digital atlases are important tools for medical research and surgical intervention. While these atlases can provide guidance in identifying anatomical structures, they do not take into account the wide variations in the shape and size of anatomical structures that can occur from patient to patient. Accurate, patient-specific representations are especially important for surgical interventions like deep brain stimulation, where even small inaccuracies can result in dangerous complications. This research effort extends the discrete deformable 2-simplex mesh into the multi-material domain where geometry-based internal forces and image-based external forces are used in the deformation process. Multi-material 2-simplex meshes having shared boundaries are initialized from multi-material triangular surface meshes. A multi-material deformable framework is presented and used to segment anatomical …",3
Contour models for descriptive patient-specific neuro-anatomical modeling: Towards a digital brainstem atlas,"Nirmal Patel, Sharmin Sultana, Michel A Audette",2015,Journal Recent Advances in Computational Methods and Clinical Applications for Spine Imaging,"This paper describes on-going work on the transposition to digital format of 2D images of a printed atlas of the brainstem. In MRI-based anatomical modeling for neurosurgery planning and simulation, the complexity of the functional anatomy entails a digital atlas approach, rather than less descriptive voxel or surface-based approaches. However, there is an insufficiency of descriptive digital atlases, in particular of the brainstem. Our approach proceeds from a series of numbered, contour-based sketches coinciding with slices of the brainstem featuring both closed and open contours. The closed contours coincide with functionally relevant regions, in which case our objective is to fill in each corresponding label, which is analogous to painting numbered regions in a paint-by-numbers kit. The open contours typically coincide with cranial nerve tracts as well as symbols representing the medullary pyramids. This …",3
Towards an anatomical modeling pipeline for simulation and accurate navigation for brain and spine surgery,"Michel A Audette, Tanweer Rashid, Shrabani Ghosh, Nirmal Patel, Sharmin Sultana",2017/7/9,Book Proceedings of the Summer Simulation Multi-Conference,"This paper summarizes work underway on neurosurgery simulation and navigation, emphasizing anatomical modeling techniques and clinical requirements for simulation. We describe innovations that center on patient-specific anatomical modeling of the brain, including skull base anatomy, and spine. In general, we advocate a model-based approach to segmentation that leverages digital atlases of the anatomy, as well as a discrete deformable contour or surface model which can be deformed to fit patient image data. Furthermore, we proceed in a manner that represents several tissue boundaries at once, whereby a voxel-based functional atlas is expressed as a deformable 2-Simplex multi-surface model. Our research has also endowed the 2-Simplex multi-surface model with shape statistics and shared faces. We also describe innovations on deformable 1-Simplex 3D contour models that have been applied to …",2

Simplex-based surface and contour models for segmentation and meshing for surgery simulation,"Michel A Audette, Rabia Haq, Tanweer Rashid, Sharmin Sultana",2015/4/12,Book Proceedings of the Symposium on Modeling and Simulation in Medicine,"Medical simulation generally requires at least two types of model: one each for the anatomy and therapy. Generally, the anatomical modeling requires separate algorithmic stages for segmentation, which maps voxel intensities from MRI/CT to tissues, and meshing, which decomposes tissues into simple shapes conducive to therapy simulation. This paper describes techniques under development that can both improve the robustness of the segmentation and simplify the meshing: 3D active Simplex surface and contour models. A n-simplex is characterized as a mesh with n+1 connectivity: a 2-Simplex produces a surface mesh where every vertex is linked by edges to 3 neighboring vertices, dual to triangulated mesh, while a 1-Simplex produces a contour model with every vertex linked to two vertices. The 2-Simplex is already well-published, and is used in conjunction with a Newtonian model of the vertex motion …",
