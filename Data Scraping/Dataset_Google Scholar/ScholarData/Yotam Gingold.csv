Structured annotations for 2D-to-3D modeling,"Yotam Gingold, Takeo Igarashi, Denis Zorin",2009/12/1,Book ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2009 papers,"We present a system for 3D modeling of free-form surfaces from 2D sketches. Our system frees users to create 2D sketches from arbitrary angles using their preferred tool, which may include pencil and paper. A 3D model is created by placing primitives and annotations on the 2D image. Our primitives are based on commonly used sketching conventions and allow users to maintain a single view of the model. This eliminates the frequent view changes inherent to existing 3D modeling tools, both traditional and sketch-based, and enables users to match input to the 2D guide image. Our annotations---same-lengths and angles, alignment, mirror symmetry, and connection curves---allow the user to communicate higher-level semantic information; through them our system builds a consistent model even in cases where the original image is inconsistent. We present the results of a user study comparing our approach to a …",195
Computing discrete shape operators on general meshes,"Eitan Grinspun, Yotam Gingold, Jason Reisman, Denis Zorin",2006/9,Journal Computer Graphics Forum," Discrete curvature and shape operators, which capture complete information about directional curvatures at a point, are essential in a variety of applications: simulation of deformable two‐dimensional objects, variational modeling and geometric data processing. In many of these applications, objects are represented by meshes. Currently, a spectrum of approaches for formulating curvature operators for meshes exists, ranging from highly accurate but computationally expensive methods used in engineering applications to efficient but less accurate techniques popular in simulation for computer graphics.

Geosemantic snapping for sketch‐based modeling,"Alex Shtof, Alexander Agathos, Yotam Gingold, Ariel Shamir, Daniel Cohen‐Or",2013/5,Journal Computer graphics forum,"Modeling 3D objects from sketches is a process that requires several challenging problems including segmentation, recognition and reconstruction. Some of these tasks are harder for humans and some are harder for the machine. At the core of the problem lies the need for semantic understanding of the shape's geometry from the sketch. In this paper we propose a method to model 3D objects from sketches by utilizing humans specifically for semantic tasks that are very simple for humans and extremely difficult for the machine, while utilizing the machine for tasks that are harder for humans. The user assists recognition and segmentation by choosing and placing specific geometric primitives on the relevant parts of the sketch. The machine first snaps the primitive to the sketch by fitting its projection to the sketch lines, and then improves the model globally by inferring geosemantic constraints that link the different …",92
Decomposing images into layers via RGB-space geometry,"Jianchao Tan, Jyh-Ming Lien, Yotam Gingold",2016/11/15,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"In digital image editing software, layers organize images. However, layers are often not explicitly represented in the final image, and may never have existed for a scanned physical painting or a photograph. We propose a technique to decompose an image into layers. In our decomposition, each layer represents a single-color coat of paint applied with varying opacity. Our decomposition is based on the image’s RGB-space geometry. In RGB-space, the linear nature of the standard Porter-Duff [1984] “over” pixel compositing operation implies a geometric structure. The vertices of the convex hull of image pixels in RGB-space correspond to a palette of paint colors. These colors may be “hidden” and inaccessible to algorithms based on clustering visible colors. For our layer decomposition, users choose the palette size (degree of simplification to perform on the convex hull), as well as a layer order for the paint colors …",84
RigMesh: automatic rigging for part-based shape modeling and deformation,"Péter Borosán, Ming Jin, Doug DeCarlo, Yotam Gingold, Andrew Nealen",2012/11/1,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"The creation of a 3D model is only the first stage of the 3D character animation pipeline. Once a model has been created, and before it can be animated, it must be rigged. Manual rigging is laborious, and automatic rigging approaches are far from real-time and do not allow for incremental updates. This is a hindrance in the real world, where the shape of a model is often revised after rigging has been performed. In this paper, we introduce algorithms and a user-interface for sketch-based 3D modeling that unify the modeling and rigging stages of the 3D character animation pipeline. Our algorithms create a rig for each sketched part in real-time, and update the rig as parts are merged or cut. As a result, users can freely pose and animate their shapes and characters while rapidly iterating on the base shape. The rigs are compatible with the state-of-the-art character animation pipeline; they consist of a low-dimensional …",69
Micro perceptual human computation for visual tasks,"Yotam Gingold, Ariel Shamir, Daniel Cohen-Or",2012/9/7,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"Human Computation (HC) utilizes humans to solve problems or carry out tasks that are hard for pure computational algorithms. Many graphics and vision problems have such tasks. Previous HC approaches mainly focus on generating data in batch, to gather benchmarks, or perform surveys demanding nontrivial interactions. We advocate a tighter integration of human computation into online, interactive algorithms. We aim to distill the differences between humans and computers and maximize the advantages of both in one algorithm. Our key idea is to decompose such a problem into a massive number of very simple, carefully designed, human micro-tasks that are based on perception, and whose answers can be combined algorithmically to solve the original problem. Our approach is inspired by previous work on micro-tasks and perception experiments. We present three specific examples for the design of micro …",61
Interactive design and stability analysis of decorative joinery for furniture,"Jiaxian Yao, Danny M Kaufman, Yotam Gingold, Maneesh Agrawala",2017/3/23,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"High-quality hand-made furniture often employs intrinsic joints that geometrically interlock along mating surfaces. Such joints increase the structural integrity of the furniture and add to its visual appeal. We present an interactive tool for designing such intrinsic joints. Users draw the visual appearance of the joints on the surface of an input furniture model as groups of two-dimensional (2D) regions that must belong to the same part. Our tool automatically partitions the furniture model into a set of solid 3D parts that conform to the user-specified 2D regions and assemble into the furniture. If the input does not merit assemblable solid 3D parts, then our tool reports the failure and suggests options for redesigning the 2D surface regions so that they are assemblable. Similarly, if any parts in the resulting assembly are unstable, then our tool suggests where additional 2D regions should be drawn to better interlock the parts …",59
A discrete model for inelastic deformation of thin shells,"Yotam Gingold, Adrian Secord, Jefferson Y Han, Eitan Grinspun, Denis Zorin",2004/8/21,Journal ACM SIGGRAPH/Eurographics symposium on computer animation,"We introduce a method for simulating the inelastic deformation of thin shells: we model plasticity and fracture of curved, deformable objects such as light bulbs, egg-shells and bowls.

We also demonstrate simple techniques to improve the robustness of standard timestepping as well as collisionresponse algorithms.",57
Pixelated image abstraction,"Timothy Gerstner, Doug DeCarlo, Marc Alexa, Adam Finkelstein, Yotam Gingold, Andrew Nealen",2012/6/4,Book Proceedings of the Symposium on Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering,"We present an automatic method that can be used to abstract high resolution images into very low resolution outputs with reduced color palettes in the style of pixel art. Our method simultaneously solves for a mapping of features and a reduced palette needed to construct the output image. The results are an approximation to the results generated by pixel artists. We compare our method against the results of a naive process common to image manipulation programs, as well as the hand-crafted work of pixel artists. Through a formal user study and interviews with expert pixel artists we show that our results offer an improvement over the naive methods.",56
Topology‐based Smoothing of 2D Scalar Fields with C1‐Continuity,"Tino Weinkauf, Yotam Gingold, Olga Sorkine",2010/6,Journal Computer Graphics Forum,"Data sets coming from simulations or sampling of real‐world phenomena often contain noise that hinders their processing and analysis. Automatic filtering and denoising can be challenging: when the nature of the noise is unknown, it is difficult to distinguish between noise and actual data features; in addition, the filtering process itself may introduce “artificial” features into the data set that were not originally present. In this paper, we propose a smoothing method for 2D scalar fields that gives the user explicit control over the data features. We define features as critical points of the given scalar function, and the topological structure they induce (i.e., the Morse‐Smale complex). Feature significance is rated according to topological persistence. Our method allows filtering out spurious features that arise due to noise by means of topological simplification, providing the user with a simple interface that defines the …",53
Efficient palette-based decomposition and recoloring of images via RGBXY-space geometry,"Jianchao Tan, Jose Echevarria, Yotam Gingold",2018/12/4,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"We introduce an extremely scalable and efficient yet simple palette-based image decomposition algorithm. Given an RGB image and set of palette colors, our algorithm decomposes the image into a set of additive mixing layers, each of which corresponds to a palette color applied with varying weight. Our approach is based on the geometry of images in RGBXY-space. This new geometric approach is orders of magnitude more efficient than previous work and requires no numerical optimization. We provide an implementation of the algorithm in 48 lines of Python code. We demonstrate a real-time layer decomposition tool in which users can interactively edit the palette to adjust the layers. After preprocessing, our algorithm can decompose 6 MP images into layers in 20 milliseconds.",50
Shading-based surface editing,"Yotam Gingold, Denis Zorin",2008/8/1,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"We present a system for free-form surface modeling that allows a user to modify a shape by changing its rendered, shaded image using stroke-based drawing tools. User input is translated into a set of tangent and positional constraints on the surface. A new shape, whose rendered image closely approximates user input, is computed using an efficient and stable surface optimization procedure. We demonstrate how several types of free-form surface edits which may be difficult to cast in terms of standard deformation approaches can be easily performed using our system.",45

A direct texture placement and editing interface,"Yotam I Gingold, Philip L Davidson, Jefferson Y Han, Denis Zorin",2006/10/15,Book Proceedings of the 19th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,"The creation of most models used in computer animation and computer games requires the assignment of texture coordinates, texture painting, and texture editing. We present a novel approach for texture placement and editing based on direct manipulation of textures on the surface. Compared to conventional tools for surface texturing, our system combines UV-coordinate specification and texture editing into one seamless process, reducing the need for careful initial design of parameterization and providing a natural interface for working with textures directly on 3D surfaces.A combination of efficient techniques for interactive constrained parameterization and advanced input devices makes it possible to realize a set of natural interaction paradigms. The texture is regarded as a piece of stretchable material, which the user can position and deform on the surface, selecting arbitrary sets of constraints and mapping …",37
Seamless: seam erasure and seam-aware decoupling of shape from mesh resolution.,"Songrun Liu, Zachary Ferguson, Alec Jacobson, Yotam I Gingold",2017/11/1,Journal ACM Trans. Graph.,"A 3D surface’s parametrization by two coordinates naturally affords defining functions or signals that map points on the surface to scalar or vector values. In practice, a triangle mesh parameterized into the unit square can define a high-resolution signal (eg, color values) at points on its 3D surface by reading the pixel values of an image at corresponding parametrization coordinates. Parameterization not only decouples the triangle mesh resolution from the signal image resolution, but also provides a bridge between levels of detail approximating the same underlying surface (see Figure 1). If two different resolution meshes of the same surface agree on a parameterization to the plane, then a signal designed for one mesh is readily defined upon other.",36
Color Me Noisy: Example‐based rendering of hand‐colored animations with temporal noise control,"Jakub Fišer, Michal Lukáč, Ondřej Jamriška, Martin Čadík, Yotam Gingold, Paul Asente, Daniel Sýkora",2014/7,Journal Computer Graphics Forum,"We present an example‐based approach to rendering hand‐colored animations which delivers visual richness comparable to real artwork while enabling control over the amount of perceived temporal noise. This is important both for artistic purposes and viewing comfort, but is tedious or even intractable to achieve manually. We analyse typical features of real hand‐colored animations and propose an algorithm that tries to mimic them using only static examples of drawing media. We apply the algorithm to various animations using different drawing media and compare the quality of synthetic results with real artwork. To verify our method perceptually, we conducted experiments confirming that our method delivers distinguishable noise levels and reduces eye strain. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our method to mask imperfections such as shower‐door artifacts.",32
Skinning cubic Bézier splines and Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces,"Songrun Liu, Alec Jacobson, Yotam Gingold",2014/11/19,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"Smooth space deformation has become a vital tool for the animation and design of 2D and 3D shapes. Linear methods, under the umbrella term of ""linear blend skinning"", are the de facto standard for 3D animations. Unfortunately such approaches do not trivially extend to deforming vector graphics, such as the cubic Bézier splines prevalent in 2D or subdivision surfaces in 3D. We propose a variational approach to reposition the control points of cubic Bézier splines and Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces---or any linear subdivision curves or surfaces---to produce curves or surfaces which match a linear blend skinning deformation as closely as possible. Exploiting the linearity of linear blend skinning, we show how this optimization collapses neatly into the repeated multiplication of a matrix per handle. We support C0, C1, G1, and fixed-angle continuity constraints between adjacent Bézier curves in a spline …",30
Decomposing time-lapse paintings into layers,"Jianchao Tan, Marek Dvorožňák, Daniel Sýkora, Yotam Gingold",2015/7/27,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"The creation of a painting, in the physical world or digitally, is a process that occurs over time. Later strokes cover earlier strokes, and strokes painted at a similar time are likely to be part of the same object. In the final painting, this temporal history is lost, and a static arrangement of color is all that remains. The rich literature for interacting with image editing history cannot be used. To enable these interactions, we present a set of techniques to decompose a time lapse video of a painting (defined generally to include pencils, markers, etc.) into a sequence of translucent ""stroke"" images. We present translucency-maximizing solutions for recovering physical (Kubelka and Munk layering) or digital (Porter and Duff ""over"" blending operation) paint parameters from before/after image pairs.

A benchmark for rough sketch cleanup,"Chuan Yan, David Vanderhaeghe, Yotam Gingold",2020/11/26,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"Sketching is a foundational step in the design process. Decades of sketch processing research have produced algorithms for 3D shape interpretation, beautification, animation generation, colorization, etc. However, there is a mismatch between sketches created in the wild and the clean, sketch-like input required by these algorithms, preventing their adoption in practice. The recent flurry of sketch vectorization, simplification, and cleanup algorithms could be used to bridge this gap. However, they differ wildly in the assumptions they make on the input and output sketches. We present the first benchmark to evaluate and focus sketch cleanup research. Our dataset consists of 281 sketches obtained in the wild and a curated subset of 101 sketches. For this curated subset along with 40 sketches from previous work, we commissioned manual vectorizations and multiple ground truth cleaned versions by professional artists …",21

It is now possible to consider the crowdsourcing of physical actions, commonly used for creative expressions such as drawing, shading, and singing.

We investigate single-individual crowds (multiple inputs from a single human) and multiple-individual crowds.",21
Shape optimization using reflection lines,"Elif Tosun, Yotam I Gingold, Jason Reisman, Denis Zorin",2007/7/4,Conference Symposium on Geometry Processing,"Many common objects have highly reflective metallic or painted finishes. Their appearance is primarily defined by the distortion the curved shape of the surface introduces in the reflections of surrounding objects. Reflection lines are commonly used for surface interrogation, as they capture many essential aspects of reflection distortion directly, and clearly show surface imperfections that may be hard to see with conventional lighting. In this paper, we propose the use of functionals based on reflection lines for mesh optimization and editing. We describe a simple and efficient discretization of such functionals based on screen-space surface parameterization, and we demonstrate how such discrete functionals can be used for several types of surface editing operations.",21

Pigmento: Pigment-based image analysis and editing,"Jianchao Tan, Stephen DiVerdi, Jingwan Lu, Yotam Gingold",2018/7/23,Journal IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,"The colorful appearance of a physical painting is determined by the distribution of paint pigments across the canvas, which we model as a per-pixel mixture of a small number of pigments with multispectral absorption and scattering coefficients. We present an algorithm to efficiently recover this structure from an RGB image, yielding a plausible set of pigments and a low RGB reconstruction error. We show that under certain circumstances we are able to recover pigments that are close to ground truth, while in all cases our results are always plausible. Using our decomposition, we repose standard digital image editing operations as operations in pigment space rather than RGB, with interestingly novel results. We demonstrate tonal adjustments, selection masking, cut-copy-paste, recoloring, palette summarization, and edge enhancement.",19

Inverse toon shading: Interactive normal field modeling with isophotes,"Qiuying Xu, Y Gingold, Karan Singh",2015/6/20,Conference Proceedings of the Symposium on Sketch-Based Interfaces and Modeling,"We introduce an interactive modeling tool for designing a smooth 3D normal field from the isophotes of a discretely shaded 2D image. Block or cartoon shading is a visual style in which artists depict a smoothly shaded 3D object using a small number of discrete brightness values, manifested as regions or bands of constant color. In our approach, artists trace isophotes, or curves of constant brightness, along the boundaries between constant color bands. Our algorithm first estimates light directions and computes 3D normals along the object silhouette and at intersections between isophotes from different light sources. We then propagate these 3D normals smoothly along isophotes, and subsequently throughout the interior of the shape. We describe our user interface for editing isophotes and correcting unintended normals produced by our algorithm. We validate our approach with a perceptual experiment and …",18
Controlled-topology filtering,"Yotam I Gingold, Denis Zorin",2006/6/6,Book Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Solid and physical modeling,"Many applications require the extraction of isolines and isosurfaces from scalar functions defined on regular grids. These scalar functions may have many different origins: from MRI and CT scan data to terrain data or results of a simulation. As a result of noise and other artifacts, curves and surfaces obtained by standard extraction algorithms often suffer from topological irregularities and geometric noise.While it is possible to remove topological and geometric noise as a post-processing step, in the case when a large number of isolines are of interest there is a considerable advantage in filtering the scalar function directly. While most smoothing filters result in gradual simplification of the topological structure of contours, new topological features typically emerge and disappear during the smoothing process.In this paper, we describe an algorithm for filtering functions defined on regular 2D grids with controlled topology …",18
Geometrical properties of a family of compactifications,"Yotam I Gingold, Harry Gingold",2007/1/21,Journal Balkan Journal of Geometry and Its Applications,We study the benefits of the explicit formulas of a parametrized family of bijections and the explicit formula of a certain metric. These formulas are induced by a family of compactifications of C that” account for all arguments of infinity”. This family of bijections map the union of C and a continuum of ideal points onto a family of spherical bowls. This family of bijections are shown to give rise to a multitude of expressions that are” invariant with respect to independent rotations”. These expressions help us generalize certain geometrical properties that are associated with the stereographic projection. Application of the metric to the approximation of unbounded functions is also demonstrated.,14

"Palette-based image decomposition, harmonization, and color transfer","Jianchao Tan, Jose Echevarria, Yotam Gingold",2018/4/4,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.01225,"We present a palette-based framework for color composition for visual applications. Color composition is a critical aspect of visual applications in art, design, and visualization. The color wheel is often used to explain pleasing color combinations in geometric terms, and, in digital design, to provide a user interface to visualize and manipulate colors. We abstract relationships between palette colors as a compact set of axes describing harmonic templates over perceptually uniform color wheels. Our framework provides a basis for a variety of color-aware image operations, such as color harmonization and color transfer, and can be applied to videos. To enable our approach, we introduce an extremely scalable and efficient yet simple palette-based image decomposition algorithm. Our approach is based on the geometry of images in RGBXY-space.

Continuous visibility feature,"Guilin Liu, Yotam Gingold, Jyh-Ming Lien",2015,Conference Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"In this work, we propose a new type of visibility measurement named Continuous Visibility Feature (CVF). We say that a point q on the mesh is continuously visible from another point p if there exists a geodesic path connecting p and q that is entirely visible by p. In order to efficiently estimate the continuous visibility for all the vertices in a model, we propose two approaches that use specific CVF properties to avoid exhaustive visibility tests. CVF is then measured as the area of the continuously visible region. With this stronger visibility measure, we show that CVF better encodes the surface and part information of mesh than the tradition line-of-sight based visibility. For example, we show that existing segmentation algorithms can generate better segmentation results using CVF and its variants than using other visibility-based shape descriptors, such as shape diameter function. Similar to visibility and other mesh surface features, continuous visibility would have many applications.",11
Video recoloring via spatial-temporal geometric palettes,"Zheng-Jun Du, Kai-Xiang Lei, Kun Xu, Jianchao Tan, Yotam Gingold",2021/7/19,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"Color correction and color grading are important steps in film production. Recent palette-based approaches to image recoloring have shown that a small set of representative colors provide an intuitive set of handles for color adjustment. However, a single, static palette cannot represent the time-varying colors in a video. We introduce a spatial-temporal geometry-based approach to video recoloring. Specifically, its core is a 4D skew polytope with a few vertices that approximately encloses the video pixels in color and time, which implicitly defines time-varying palettes through slicing of the 4D skew polytope at specific time values. Our geometric palette is compact, descriptive, and provides a correspondence between colors throughout the video, including topological changes when colors merge or split. Experiments show that our method produces natural, artifact-free recoloring.",8
FlatMagic: Improving Flat Colorization through AI-Driven Design for Digital Comic Professionals,"Chuan Yan, John Joon Young Chung, Yoon Kiheon, Yotam Gingold, Eytan Adar, Sungsoo Ray Hong",2022/4/29,Book Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems," Creating digital comics involves multiple stages, some creative and some menial. For example, coloring a comic requires a labor-intensive stage known as ‘flatting,’ or masking segments of continuous color, as well as creative shading, lighting, and stylization stages. The use of AI can automate the colorization process, but early efforts have revealed limitations—technical and UX—to full automation. Via a formative study of professionals, we identify flatting as a bottleneck and key target of opportunity for human-guided AI-driven automation. Based on this insight, we built FlatMagic, an interactive, AI-driven flat colorization support tool for Photoshop. Our user studies found that using FlatMagic significantly reduced professionals’ real and perceived effort versus their current practice.

Bijective Deformations in R^n via Integral Curve Coordinates,"Lisa Huynh, Yotam Gingold",2015/5/1,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.00073,"Shape deformation is a widely studied problem in computer graphics, with applications to animation, physical simulation, parameterization, interactive modeling, and image editing. In one instance of this problem, a \cage"" (polygon in 2D and polyhedra in 3D) is created around a shape or image region. As the vertices of the cage are moved, the interior deforms. The cage may be identical to the shape's boundary, which has one fewer dimension than the shape itself, and is typically more convenient, as the cage may be simpler (fewer vertices) or be free of undesirable properties (such as a non-manifold mesh or high topological genus). We introduce Integral Curve Coordinates and use them to create shape deformations that are bijective, given a bijective deformation of the shape's boundary or an enclosing cage. Our approach can be applied to shapes in any dimension, provided that the boundary of the shape (or cage) is topologically equivalent to an n-sphere. Integral Curve Coordinates identify each point in a domain with a point along an integral curve of the gradient of a function f, where f has exactly one critical point, a maximum, in the domain, and the gradient of f on the boundary points inward. By identifying every point inside a domain (shape) with a point on its boundary, Integral Curve Coordinates provide a natural mapping from one domain to another given a mapping of the boundary. We evaluate our deformation approach in 2D. Our algorithm is based on the following three steps: (i) choosing a maximum via a grass re algorithm; (ii) computing a suitable function f on a discrete grid via a construct called the cousin tree; (iii) tracing …",4
I♥ LA: compilable markdown for linear algebra,"Yong Li, Shoaib Kamil, Alec Jacobson, Yotam Gingold",2021/12/10,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"Communicating linear algebra in written form is challenging: mathematicians must choose between writing in languages that produce well-formatted but semantically-underdefined representations such as LaTeX; or languages with well-defined semantics but notation unlike conventional math, such as C++/Eigen. In both cases, the underlying linear algebra is obfuscated by the requirements of esoteric language syntax (as in LaTeX) or awkward APIs due to language semantics (as in C++). The gap between representations results in communication challenges, including underspecified and irrepro-ducible research results, difficulty teaching math concepts underlying complex numerical code, as well as repeated, redundant, and error-prone translations from communicated linear algebra to executable code.

ScaffoldSketch: accurate industrial design drawing in VR,"Xue Yu, Stephen DiVerdi, Akshay Sharma, Yotam Gingold",2021/10/10,Book The 34th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology,"We present an approach to in-air design drawing based on the two-stage approach common in 2D design drawing practice. The primary challenge to 3D drawing in-air is the accuracy of users’ strokes. Beautifying or auto-correcting an arbitrary drawing in 2D or 3D is challenging due to ambiguities stemming from many possible interpretations of a stroke. A similar challenge appears when drawing freehand on paper in the real world. 2D design drawing practice (as taught in industrial design school) addresses this by decomposing the process of creating realistic 2D projections of 3D shapes. Designers first create scaffold or construction lines. When drawing shape or structure curves, designers are guided by the scaffolds. Our key insight is that accurate industrial design drawing in 3D becomes tractable when decomposed into auto-correcting scaffold strokes, which have simple relationships with one another …",3
A spherical projection of a complex Hilbert space is conformal iff it is the stereographic projection.,"Harry Gingold, Yotam Gingold, Salah Hamad",2018/1/1,Journal Differential Geometry--Dynamical Systems,We consider a family of nonlinear projections that map a complex Hilbert space onto a bounded “bowl” shaped subset of a sphere. Our main result states that a projection is conformal iff it is the stereographic projection and iff the projection renders all certain pairs of triangles induced by the projection to be similar. It follows that various so called “compactifications” that are given in the literature are special members of this family of nonlinear projections. These include the stereographic projection and the Poincare compactification. Background and motivation are discussed and several examples illustrating the results are provided.,3
PosterChild: Blend‐Aware Artistic Posterization,"Cheng‐Kang Ted Chao, Karan Singh, Yotam Gingold",2021/7,Journal Computer Graphics Forum,"Posterization is an artistic effect which converts continuous images into regions of constant color with smooth boundaries, often with an artistically recolored palette. Artistic posterization is extremely time‐consuming and tedious. We introduce a blend‐aware algorithm for generating posterized images with palette‐based control for artistic recoloring. Our algorithm automatically extracts a palette and then uses multi‐label optimization to find blended‐color regions in terms of that palette.

Using isophotes and shadows to interactively model normal and height fields,"Qiuying Xu, Songrun Liu, Yotam Gingold, Karan Singh",2016/10/1,Journal Computers & Graphics,"We introduce an interactive modeling tool for designing (a) a smooth 3D normal field from the isophotes of a discretely shaded 2D image and (b) lifting the normal field into a smooth height field given a cast shadow. Block or cartoon shading is a visual style in which artists depict a smoothly shaded 3D object using a small number of discrete brightness values, manifested as regions or bands of constant color. In our approach, artists trace isophotes, or curves of constant brightness, along the boundaries between constant color bands. Our algorithm first estimates light directions and computes 3D normals along the object silhouette and at intersections between isophotes from different light sources. We then propagate these 3D normals smoothly along isophotes, and subsequently throughout the interior of the shape. We describe our user interface for editing isophotes and correcting unintended normals produced by …",2
Simulation of perspective by nonlinear transformations,"Yotam I Gingold, Harry Gingold",2013/6/1,Journal Mathematical Modelling and Analysis,"A feature of the brain processing the visualization of objects is such that objects that are much farther away from the eye look smaller than closer objects to the eye. We show that a family of nonlinear transformations, also to be called compactifications, simulate qualitatively this property of keeping objects in perspective. These transformations project objects in a plane on a spherical shell. It is shown then that an observer located at a fixed point on the axis of the sphere visualizes the projected objects on the sphere in perspective. Namely, that objects that are farther away from the observation point seem smaller. Examples are provided. This is a departure from the traditional approaches using linearity and projections of objects from one plane into another plane.",2

Interacting with self-similarity,"Josef Graus, Alec Jacobson, Yotam Gingold",2021/1/1,Journal Computer-Aided Design,"Shape similarity is a fundamental problem in geometry processing, enabling applications such as surface correspondence, segmentation, and edit propagation. For example, a user may paint a stroke on one finger of a model and desire the edit to propagate to all fingers. Automatic approaches have difficulty matching user expectations, either due to an algorithm’s inability to guess the scale at which the user is intending to edit or due to underlying deficiencies in the similarity metric (e.g., semantic information not present in the geometry).",1
Hyperspectral Inverse Skinning,"Songrun Liu, Jianchao Tan, Zhigang Deng, Yotam Gingold",2020/9,Journal Computer Graphics Forum,"In example‐based inverse linear blend skinning (LBS), a collection of poses (e.g. animation frames) are given, and the goal is finding skinning weights and transformation matrices that closely reproduce the input. These poses may come from physical simulation, direct mesh editing, motion capture or another deformation rig. We provide a re‐formulation of inverse skinning as a problem in high‐dimensional Euclidean space. The transformation matrices applied to a vertex across all poses can be thought of as a point in high dimensions. We cast the inverse LBS problem as one of finding a tight‐fitting simplex around these points (a well‐studied problem in hyperspectral imaging). Although we do not observe transformation matrices directly, the 3D position of a vertex across all of its poses defines an affine subspace, or flat. We solve a ‘closest flat’ optimization problem to find points on these flats, and then compute a …",1

Video-Based Rendering of Dynamic Stationary Environments from Unsynchronized Inputs,"Cheng-Kang Ted Chao, Karan Singh, Yotam Gingold",2021/7/1,Journal COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM,"Image-Based Rendering allows users to easily capture a scene using a single camera and then navigate freely with realistic results. However, the resulting renderings are completely static, and dynamic effects - such as fire, waterfalls or small waves - cannot be reproduced. We tackle the challenging problem of enabling free-viewpoint navigation including such stationary dynamic effects, but still maintaining the simplicity of casual capture. Using a single camera - instead of previous complex synchronized multi-camera setups - means that we have unsynchronized videos of the dynamic effect from multiple views, making it hard to blend them when synthesizing novel views. We present a solution that allows smooth free-viewpoint video-based rendering (VBR) of such scenes using temporal Laplacian pyramid decomposition video, enabling spatio-temporal blending. For effects such as fire and waterfalls, that are …",
The Field of Vision Through a Virtual Window to a Virtual Environment has a Smaller Effect than Age on Completion Time of a Dexterous Task,"JOSHUA PARK, Yotam Gingold",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"The sense of body ownership and sense of embodiment are crucial parts of the virtual and augmented reality experience and are often enhanced by the use of virtual reality goggles. However, these goggles can be quite costly. This can pose a problem for institutions who have limited financial resources and need to train new recruits on dexterous tasks in a virtual environment. Finding an alternative to these goggles with reliable hand tracking technology can remove these barriers. One solution to this problem is orienting a desktop screen with a LEAP motion hand sensor behind the screen to create a ‘window’into a virtual world. In order to determine whether the field of view, which could distort this virtual window, has an impact on the completion time of a task, we created a dexterity test inside the Unity game engine.

Agent script generation using descriptive text documents,"Tim Balint, Yotam Gingold, Jan M Allbeck",2014/11/6,Book Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Motion in Games,"When designing games, artists exert large efforts to create visually compelling scenes. Work such as WordsEye [Coyne and Sproat 2001] can assist artists by parsing natural language texts into static scenes. Complementary to this endeavour is the population of that environment by simulation authors. Adding agents to an environment with plausible behaviors is a time consuming process, as most require individual scripts to control their behavior. This generally degrades variability, as scripts are re-used. In order to assist in creating commands and scenes for virtual actors, we propose a method that can create scripts for agents to plausibly act within a virtual environment. This work is inspired by [Ma 2006], which provides an action to a virtual agent from a single sentence. However, our method works for several agents over longer periods of time.",

Video Summarization using Crowdsourced Causality Graphs,"Shay Sheinfeld, Yotam Gingold, Ariel Shamir","Video summarization is useful for many applications such as content skimming and searching. Automatic video summarization is extremely challenging as it often depends on semantic tasks such as determining meaning, causal relationships, and importance of the displayed video events. We present a reliable, crowdsourced solution to video summarization based on human computation that addresses one of the main semantic challenges in story understanding: recognizing cause and effect. Our approach first automatically divides the video into simple shots as atomic elements. Using these elements, we first construct a context-tree (Verroios and Bernstein 2014) to gain global understanding, and then introduce a crowdsourced algorithm that explicitly builds a causality graph representing the causality relations between events in the video. We use both importance and causality to create a summary of the original video. Our evaluation shows that information from the causality graph creates better summarizations of the original video.","Scholar articles Video Summarization using Crowdsourced Causality GraphsS Sheinfeld, Y Gingold, A ShamirRelated articles ","Video summarization is useful for many applications such as content skimming and searching.
