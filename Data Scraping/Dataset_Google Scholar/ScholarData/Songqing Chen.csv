"Measurements, analysis, and modeling of bittorrent-like systems","Lei Guo, Songqing Chen, Zhen Xiao, Enhua Tan, Xiaoning Ding, Xiaodong Zhang",2005/10/19,Book Proceedings of the 5th ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement,"Existing studies on BitTorrent systems are single-torrent based, while more than 85% of all peers participate in multiple torrents according to our trace analysis. In addition, these studies are not sufficiently insightful and accurate even for single-torrent models, due to some unrealistic assumptions. Our analysis of representative Bit-Torrent traffic provides several new findings regarding the limitations of BitTorrent systems:(1) Due to the exponentially decreasing peer arrival rate in reality, service availability in such systems becomes poor quickly, after which it is difficult for the file to be located and downloaded.(2) Client performance in the BitTorrentlike systems is unstable, and fluctuates widely with the peer population.(3) Existing systems could provide unfair services to peers, where peers with high downloading speed tend to download more and upload less. In this paper, we study these limitations on torrent evolution in realistic environments. Motivated by the analysis and modeling results, we further build a graph based multi-torrent model to study inter-torrent collaboration. Our model quantitatively provides strong motivation for inter-torrent collaboration instead of directly stimulating seeds to stay longer. We also discuss a system design to show the feasibility of multi-torrent collaboration.",550

A new deep learning-based food recognition system for dietary assessment on an edge computing service infrastructure,"Chang Liu, Yu Cao, Yan Luo, Guanling Chen, Vinod Vokkarane, Ma Yunsheng, Songqing Chen, Peng Hou",2017/1/31,Journal IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,"Literature has indicated that accurate dietary assessment is very important for assessing the effectiveness of weight loss interventions. However, most of the existing dietary assessment methods rely on memory. With the help of pervasive mobile devices and rich cloud services, it is now possible to develop new computer-aided food recognition system for accurate dietary assessment. However, enabling this future Internet of Things-based dietary assessment imposes several fundamental challenges on algorithm development and system design. In this paper, we set to address these issues from the following two aspects: (1) to develop novel deep learning-based visual food recognition algorithms to achieve the best-in-class recognition accuracy; (2) to design a food recognition system employing edge computing-based service computing paradigm to overcome some inherent problems of traditional mobile cloud …",271

Adaptive and lazy segmentation based proxy caching for streaming media delivery,"Songqing Chen, Bo Shen, Susie Wee, Xiaodong Zhang",2003/6/1,Book Proceedings of the 13th international workshop on Network and Operating Systems Support for Digital Audio and Video,"Streaming media objects are often cached in segments. Previous segment-based caching strategies cache segments with constant or exponentially increasing lengths and typically favor caching the beginning segments of media objects. However, these strategies typically do not consider the fact that most accesses are targeted toward a few popular objects. In this paper, we argue that neither the use of a predefined segment length nor the favorable caching of the beginning segments is the best caching strategy for reducing network traffic. We propose an adaptive and lazy segmentation based caching mechanism by delaying the segmentation as late as possible and determining the segment length based on the client access behaviors in real time. In addition, the admission and eviction of segments are carried out adaptively based on an accurate utility function. The proposed method is evaluated by simulations …",160

Chrome Extensions: Threat Analysis and Countermeasures.,"Lei Liu, Xinwen Zhang, Guanhua Yan, Songqing Chen",2012/2,Conference NDSS,"The widely popular browser extensions now become one of the most commonly used malware attack vectors. The Google Chrome browser, which implements the principles of least privileges and privilege separation by design, offers a strong security mechanism to protect malicious websites from damaging the whole browser system via extensions. In this study, we however reveal that Chrome’s extension security model is not a panacea for all possible attacks with browser extensions. Through a series of practical bot-based attacks that can be performed even under typical settings, we demonstrate that malicious Chrome extensions pose serious threats, including both information dispersion and harvesting, to browsers. We further conduct an in-depth analysis of Chrome’s extension security model, and conclude that its vulnerabilities are rooted from the violation of the principles of least privileges and privilege separation. Following these principles, we propose a set of countermeasures that enforce the policies of microprivilege management and differentiating DOM elements. Using a prototype developed on the latest Chrome browser, we show that they can effectively mitigate the threats posed by malicious Chrome extensions with little effect on normal browsing experience.",112

Proceedings 11","Bot-like malware has posed an immense threat to computer security. Bot detection is still a challenging task since bot developers are continuously adopting advanced techniques to make bots more stealthy. A typical bot exhibits three invariant features along its onset:(1) the startup of a bot is automatic without requiring any user actions;(2) a bot must establish a command and control channel with its botmaster; and (3) a bot will perform local or remote attacks sooner or later. These invariants indicate three indispensable phases (startup, preparation, and attack) for a bot attack. In this paper, we propose BotTracer to detect these three phases with the assistance of virtual machine techniques. To validate BotTracer, we implement a prototype of BotTracer based on VMware and Windows XP Professional. The results show that Bot-Tracer has successfully detected all the bots in the experiments without any false negatives.",111
PSM-throttling: Minimizing energy consumption for bulk data communications in WLANs,"Enhua Tan, Lei Guo, Songqing Chen, Xiaodong Zhang",2007/10/16,Conference 2007 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols,"While the 802.11 power saving mode (PSM) and its enhancements can reduce power consumption by putting the wireless network interface (WNI) into sleep as much as possible, they either require additional infrastructure support, or may degrade the transmission throughput and cause additional transmission delay. These schemes are not suitable for long and bulk data transmissions with strict QoS requirements on wireless devices. With increasingly abundant bandwidth available on the Internet, we have observed that TCP congestion control is often not a constraint of bulk data transmissions as bandwidth throttling is widely used in practice. In this paper, instead of further manipulating the trade-off between the power saving and the incurred delay, we effectively explore the power saving potential by considering the bandwidth throttling on streaming/downloading servers.

Scotch: Elastically scaling up sdn control-plane using vswitch based overlay,"An Wang, Yang Guo, Fang Hao, TV Lakshman, Songqing Chen",2014/12/2,Book Proceedings of the 10th ACM International on Conference on emerging Networking Experiments and Technologies,"Software Defined Networks use logically centralized control due to its benefits in maintaining a global network view and in simplifying programmability. However, the use of centralized controllers can affect network performance if the control path between the switches and their associated controllers becomes a bottleneck. We find from measurements that the software control agents on some of the switches have very limited throughput. This can cause performance degradation if the switch has to handle a high traffic load, as for instance due to flash crowds or DDoS attacks. This degradation can occur even when the data plane capacity is under-utilized. The goal of our paper is to design new mechanisms to enable the network to scale up its ability to handle high control traffic loads.

To timely detect spam in large social network sites, it is desirable to discover unsupervised schemes that can save the training cost of supervised schemes. In this work, we first show several limitations of existing unsupervised detection schemes. The main reason behind the limitations is that existing schemes heavily rely on spamming patterns that are constantly changing to avoid detection. Motivated by our observations, we first propose a sybil defense based spam detection scheme SD2 that remarkably outperforms existing schemes by taking the social network relationship into consideration. In order to make it highly robust in facing an increased level of spam attacks, we further design an unsupervised spam detection scheme, called UNIK. Instead of detecting spammers directly …",106

Optile: Toward optimal tiling in 360-degree video streaming,"Mengbai Xiao, Chao Zhou, Yao Liu, Songqing Chen",2017/10/19,Book Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia,"360-degree videos are encoded for adaptive streaming by first projecting the spherical surface onto two-dimensional frames, then encoding these as standard video segments. During playback of these 360-degree videos, the video player renders the portion of the spherical surface in the direction of the user's view. These user viewports typically cover only a small portion of the 360 degree surface, causing much of the downloaded bandwidth to be wasted. Tile-based approaches can reduce the wasted bandwidth by cutting video spatially into motion-constrained rectangles. Streaming logic then only needs to download the tiles necessary to render the viewport seen by the user. Existing tile-based approaches cut 360-degree videos into tiles of fixed sizes. These fixed-size tiling approaches, however, suffer from reduced encoding efficiency. Tiling cuts away portions of the video that can be copied by the encoder …",101

Once the buffer fills, the earlier parts are automatically deleted. The buffer therefore holds a most-recently delivered window of content. If a second request for the same content comes in, a check is made to see if the start of the content is still in the first buffer. If it is, the content is delivered from the first buffer. Otherwise, a second buffer is opened and both buffers are used to deliver what they can simultaneously.

Mainly focusing on BitTorrent-like file sharing systems, several recent studies have demonstrated how to efficiently bridge the overlay and the underlying network by leveraging the existing infrastructure, such as CDN services or developing new application-ISP interfaces, such as P4P. However, so far the traffic locality in existing P2P live streaming systems has not been well studied. In this work, taking PPLive as an example, we examine traffic locality in Internet P2P streaming systems.

Towards cost-effective moving target defense against ddos and covert channel attacks,"Huangxin Wang, Fei Li, Songqing Chen",2016/10/24,Book Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense,"Traditionally, network and system configurations are static.

An unpredictable system configuration can significantly lift the bar for attackers to conduct successful attacks. Recent years, moving target defense (MTD) has been advocated for this purpose. An MTD mechanism aims to introduce dynamics to the system through changing its configuration continuously over time, which we call adaptations. Though promising, the dynamic system reconfiguration introduces overhead to the applications currently running in the system. It is critical to determine the right time to conduct adaptations and to balance the overhead afforded and the security levels guaranteed. This problem is known as the MTD timing problem.

Adaptive memory allocations in clusters to handle unexpectedly large data-intensive jobs,"Li Xiao, Songquing Chen, Xiaodong Zhang",2004/6/1,Journal IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,"In a cluster system with dynamic load sharing support, a job submission or migration to a workstation is determined by the availability of CPU and memory resources of the workstation at the time (L.

In such a system, a small number of running jobs with unexpectedly large memory allocation requirements may significantly increase the queuing delay times of the rest of jobs with normal memory requirements, slowing down execution of each individual job and decreasing the system throughput. We call this phenomenon the job blocking problem because the big jobs block the execution pace of majority jobs in the cluster.

PAT: Peer-assisted transcoding for overlay streaming to heterogeneous devices,"Dongyu Liu, Eric Setton, Bo Shen, Songqing Chen",2007/6/4,Journal Proc. Int. Workshop Netw. Oper. Syst. Support Dig. Audio Video,"With the increasing deployment of Internet P2P/overlay streaming systems, more and more clients use mobile devices, such as smart phones, PDAs, to access these Internet streaming services. Compared to wired desktops, mobile devices normally have smaller screen size, less color depth, and lower bandwidth and thus cannot correctly and effectively render and display the data streamed to desktops. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose PAT (Peer-Assisted Transcoding) to enable effective online transcoding in P2P/overlay streaming. PAT has the following unique features. First, it leverages active peer cooperation without demanding infrastructure support such as a transcoding server. Second, as online transcoding is computationally intensive while the diverse devices used by participating nodes may have limited computing power and related resources (eg, battery, bandwidth), an additional overlay, called metadata overlay, is constructed to instantly share the intermediate transcoding result of a transcoding procedure with other transcoding nodes to minimize the total computing overhead in the system. The experimental results collected within a realistically simulated testbed show that by consuming 6% extra bandwidth, PAT could save up to 58% CPU cycles for online transcoding.",29

In this paper, we revisit the security of Bitcoin blockchain by incorporating the network synchronization into the security model and evaluating that in practice. Towards this goal, we propose the ideal functionality for the Bitcoin network synchronization and specify bounds on the network outdegree and the block propagation delay in order to preserve the consistency property. By contrasting the ideal functionality against measurements, we find deteriorating network synchronization reported by Bitnodes and a …",18
COPYCAT: practical adversarial attacks on visualization-based malware detection,"Aminollah Khormali, Ahmed Abusnaina, Songqing Chen, DaeHun Nyang, Aziz Mohaisen",2019/9/20,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.09735,"Despite many attempts, the state-of-the-art of adversarial machine learning on malware detection systems generally yield unexecutable samples. In this work, we set out to examine the robustness of visualization-based malware detection system against adversarial examples (AEs) that not only are able to fool the model, but also maintain the executability of the original input. As such, we first investigate the application of existing off-the-shelf adversarial attack approaches on malware detection systems through which we found that those approaches do not necessarily maintain the functionality of the original inputs. Therefore, we proposed an approach to generate adversarial examples, COPYCAT, which is specifically designed for malware detection systems considering two main goals; achieving a high misclassification rate and maintaining the executability and functionality of the original input. We designed two main configurations for COPYCAT, namely AE padding and sample injection. While the first configuration results in untargeted misclassification attacks, the sample injection configuration is able to force the model to generate a targeted output, which is highly desirable in the malware attribution setting. We evaluate the performance of COPYCAT through an extensive set of experiments on two malware datasets, and report that we were able to generate adversarial samples that are misclassified at a rate of 98.9% and 96.5% with Windows and IoT binary datasets, respectively, outperforming the misclassification rates in the literature.

In this study, we set to explore different design choices and investigate the corresponding trade-offs among resource consumption, measurement accuracy, implementation complexity, and impact on switching speed. For this purpose, we empirically design and implement four different measurement schemes in OVS, by either closely integrating forwarding and measurement functions into a pipeline, or decoupling them into parallel operations.

In such a system, a small number of running jobs with unexpectedly large memory allocation requirements may significantly increase the queuing delay times of the rest of jobs with normal memory requirements, slowing down executions of individual jobs and decreasing the system throughput. We call this phenomenon as the job blocking problem because the big jobs block the execution pace of majority jobs in the cluster.

Amtrac: Adaptive meta-caching for transcoding,"Dongyu Liu, Songqing Chen, Bo Shen",2006/5/26,Book Proceedings of the 2006 international workshop on Network and operating systems support for digital audio and video,"The increase of aggregate Internet bandwidth and the rapid development of 3G wireless networks demand efficient delivery of multimedia objects to all types of wireless devices. To handle requests from wireless devices at runtime, the transcode-enabled caching proxy has been proposed and a lot of research has been conducted to study online transcoding. Since transcoding is a CPU-intensive task, the transcoded versions can be saved to reduce the CPU load for future requests. However, extensively caching all transcoded results can quickly exhaust cache space. Constrained by available CPU and storage, existing transcode-enabled caching schemes always selectively cache certain transcoded versions, expecting that many future requests can be served from the cache while leaving CPU cycles for online transcoding for other requests.

Abusing Public Third-Party Services for EDoS Attacks.,"Huangxin Wang, Zhonghua Xi, Fei Li, Songqing Chen",2016/8/8,Conference WOOT,"Cloud computing has been widely adopted nowadays as it provides economical, elastic and scalable services to customers. The cloud resources are offered in an ondemand manner and the consumers are charged based on their resource usage, known as “pay-as-you-go”. Such a cloud utility scheme opens the door to Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks in which the cloud consumers would suffer from financial losses. In this paper, we uncover the severity of EDoS attacks through demonstrating that EDoS attacks can be easily conducted at very low costs. In specific, we show that attackers can launch amplification attacks against the cloud consumers by abusing the free public third-party services provided by the Internet giants such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and LinkedIn. Through studying the characteristics of 10 main public third-party services, we reveal that all of them can be abused to launch EDoS attacks and the amplification factor can reach up to 135K. To combat against the uncovered attacks, we propose several mitigation strategies for the third-party service providers as well as the cloud consumers.",16

However, current practice has addressed the problems separately and is far from being satisfactory. On one end, due to varying channel conditions, WLANs have to provide multiple data channel rates to support various signal qualities. A low channel rate station not only suffers low throughput, but also significantly degrades the throughput of other stations. On the other end, TCP is not energy efficient running on 802.11. In a TCP session, a wireless network interface (WNI) has to stay awake to generate timely acknowledgments, and hence, the energy is wasted by channel listening during idle awake time. In this paper, considering the needs of both ends, we utilize the idle communication power of the WNI to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of stations in WLANs with multiple channel rates. We characterize the energy efficiency as energy per bit, instead of energy per second. Based on modeling and analysis, we propose a data forwarding mechanism and an energy-aware channel allocation mechanism. In such a system, a high channel rate station relays data frames between its neighboring stations with low channel rates and the Access Point, improving their throughput and energy efficiency. Different from traditional relaying approaches, our scheme compensates for the energy consumption for data forwarding. The forwarding station obtains additional channel access time from its beneficiaries, leading to the increase of its own throughput …",16

POSTER: How Distributed Are Today's DDoS Attacks?,"An Wang, Wentao Chang, Aziz Mohaisen, Songqing Chen",2014/11/3,Book Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"Today botnets are responsible for most of the DDoS attacks on the Internet. Understanding the characteristics of such DDoS attacks is critical to develop effective DDoS mitigation schemes. In this poster, we present some preliminary findings, mainly concerning the distribution of the attackers, of today's DDoS attacks. Our investigation is based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks collected within a seven-month period for activities across the globe. These attacks were launched by 674 botnet generations from 23 different bonet families with a total of 9026 victim IPs belonging to 1074 organizations that are collectively located in 186 countries. We find that different from the traditional widely distributed intuition, most of these DDoS attacks are not widely distributed as the attackers are mostly from the same region, i.e., highly regionalized.

Streaming flow analyses for prefetching in segment-based proxy caching to improve delivery quality,"Songqing Chen, Bo Shen, Susie Wee, Xiaodong Zhang",2004,Conference Web Content Caching and Distribution: Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop,"Segment-based proxy caching schemes have been effectively used to deliver streaming media objects. However, this approach does not always guarantee continuous delivery because the to-be-viewed segments may not be cached in the proxy in time. The potential consequence is the playback jitter at the client side due to the proxy delay in fetching these uncached segments, thus we call the problem proxy jitter. Aiming at improving the media delivery quality for segment-based caching schemes, in this paper we propose two simple and effective prefetching methods, namely, look-ahead window based prefetching and active prefetching to address the problem of proxy jitter.

Root cause analyses for the deteriorating bitcoin network synchronization,"Muhammad Saad, Songqing Chen, David Mohaisen",2021/7/7,Conference 2021 IEEE 41st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS),"The Bitcoin network synchronization is crucial for its security against partitioning attacks.

However, in the last few months, the network synchronization has deteriorated despite a constant network size. The change in the synchronization pattern suggests that the network size is not the only factor in place, necessitating a root cause analysis of network synchronization. In this paper, we perform a root cause analysis to study four factors that affect network synchronization: the unreachable nodes, the addressing protocol, the information relaying protocol, and the network churn.

A significant and unnecessary Web access delay is caused by the overhead in proxy servers to process two types of accesses, namely dynamic Web contents and secured transactions, not only increasing response time, but also raising some security concerns. Conducting experiments on Squid proxy 2.3 STABLE4, we have quantified the unnecessary processing overhead to show their significant impact on increased client access response times. We have also analyzed the technical difficulties in eliminating or reducing the processing overhead and the security loopholes based on the existing proxy structure. In order to address these performance and security concerns, we propose a simple but effective technique from the client side that adds a detector interfacing with a browser. With this detector, a standard browser, such as the Netscape/Mozilla, will have simple detective and scheduling functions, called a detective browser. Upon an Internet request from a user, the detective browser can immediately determine whether the requested content is dynamic or secured. If so, the browser will bypass the proxy and forward the request directly to the Web server; otherwise, the request will be processed through the proxy.

Adaptive noise injection against side-channel attacks on ARM platform,"Naiwei Liu, Wanyu Zang, Songqing Chen, Meng Yu, Ravi Sandhu",2019/1/29,Journal EAI Endorsed Transactions on Security and Safety,"In recent years, research efforts have been made to develop safe and secure environments for ARM platform. The new ARMv8 architecture brought in security features by design. However, there are still some security problems with ARMv8. For example, on Cortex-A series, there are risks that the system is vulnerable to sidechannel attacks. One major category of side-channel attacks utilizes cache memory to obtain a victim’s secret information. In the cache based side-channel attacks, an attacker measures a sequence of cache operations to obtain a victim’s memory access information, deriving more sensitive information. The success of such attacks highly depends on accurate information about the victim’s cache accesses. In this paper, we describe an innovative approach to defend against side-channel attack on Cortex-A series chips. We also considered the side-channel attacks in the context of using TrustZone protection on ARM.

Against this backdrop, we propose a novel in-process sandboxing mechanism called sePlugin to monitor and confine suspicious behaviors of plugins in popular commodity browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorers. sePlugin enhances the security of a browser by controlling how plugins access the browser’s internal objects and external systemlevel resources such as file systems and network interfaces. sePlugin deals with both native and .NET-based plugins and its unique design renders it possible to work with commodity web browsers without requiring any modifications to the legacy browser architecture or plugin code.

Considering user access patterns and characteristics of the requested media objects, our techniques adaptively allocate memory buffers to fully utilize the currently buffered data of streaming sessions, with the aim to reduce both the server load and the network traffic.

However, this approach does not always guarantee the continuous delivery because the tobe-viewed segments may not be cached in the proxy in time. The potential consequence is the playback jitter at the client side due to the proxy delay in fetching these uncached segments, thus we call the problem as proxy jitter. Aiming at improving the media delivery quality for segmentbased caching schemes, in this paper, we propose two simple and effective prefetching methods, namely, look-ahead window based prefetching and active prefetching to address the problem of proxy jitter. We focus on presenting streaming flow analyses on proxy and network resource utilizations and consumptions, performance potentials and limits of the two prefetching methods for different segment-based schemes under different network bandwidth conditions.

"Development and Application of a Plasma Planarization Process. f th nd Internation I Multilevel Interconnect Conference, June 25-26, 1985","GR Ray, Paul J Marcoux",1985,"Journal Santa Clara, CA","Techniques for planarizing intermediate and inter level dielectrics are of increasing importance to the development of VLSI interconnect systems. The combination of interconnect lines with narrow spaces (< 3.0 microns) with nearly conformal dielectrics results in large topographical variations. These variations result in poor step coverage for sputtered metal films, cause excessive linewidth variation in lithography, and require highly selective anisotropic dry etch processes. Without a planarized dielectric multilevel interconnect systems are significantly more difficult to manufacture. The plasma planarization process [1] involves spinning a planarizing organic film, usually positive photoresist, over the dielectric film and hard baking. The photoresist and dielectric are then dry etched until the photoresist is completely removed. The resulting dielectric topography is the product of the resist topography and the relative etch rates.

Elastically Augmenting the Control-path Throughput in SDN to Deal with Internet DDoS Attacks,"Yuanjun Dai, An Wang, Yang Guo, Songqing Chen",2023/2/23,Journal ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,"Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have been prevalent on the Internet for decades.

When attacks happen, the control path between the switches and their associated controllers may become congested due to their limited capacity. However, the data plane visibility of SDN provides new opportunities to defend against DDoS attacks in the cloud computing environment.

SFS: smart OS scheduling for serverless functions,"Yuqi Fu, Li Liu, Haoliang Wang, Yue Cheng, Songqing Chen",2022/9/4,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.01709,"Serverless computing enables a new way of building and scaling cloud applications by allowing developers to write fine-grained serverless or cloud functions. The execution duration of a cloud function is typically short-ranging from a few milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. However, due to resource contentions caused by public clouds' deep consolidation, the function execution duration may get significantly prolonged and fail to accurately account for the function's true resource usage. We observe that the function duration can be highly unpredictable with huge amplification of more than 50x for an open-source FaaS platform (OpenLambda). Our experiments show that the OS scheduling policy of cloud functions' host server can have a crucial impact on performance. The default Linux scheduler, CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler), being oblivious to workloads, frequently context-switches short functions, causing a turnaround time that is much longer than their service time. We propose SFS (Smart Function Scheduler),which works entirely in the user space and carefully orchestrates existing Linux FIFO and CFS schedulers to approximate Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). SFS uses two-level scheduling that seamlessly combines a new FILTER policy with Linux CFS, to trade off increased duration of long functions for significant performance improvement for short functions. We implement {\proj} in the Linux user space and port it to OpenLambda. Evaluation results show that SFS significantly improves short functions' duration with a small impact on relatively longer functions, compared to CFS.",

BotSifter: A SDN-based Online Bot Detection Framework in Data Centers,"An Wang, Zili Zha, Yang Guo, Douglas Montgomery, Songqing Chen",2019/6/9,"Publisher An Wang, Zili Zha, Yang Guo, Douglas Montgomery, Songqing Chen","Botnets continue to be one of the most severe security threats plaguing the Internet. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of cloud-hosted botnets along with the increasing popularity of cloud platforms, which attracted not only various applications/services, but also botnets. However, even the latest botnet detection mechanisms (eg, machine learning based) fail to meet the requirement of accurate and expeditious detection in data centers, because they often demand intensive resources to support traffic monitoring and collection, which is hardly practical considering the traffic volume in data centers. Furthermore, they provide little understanding on different phases of the bot activities, which is essential for identifying the malicious intent of bots in their early stages.

Connecting the Dots: Privacy Leakage via Write-Access Patterns to the Main Memory,"An Wang, Wentao Chang, Songqing Chen, Aziz Mohaisen",2018,"Description Despite continuous defense efforts, DDoS attacks are still very prevalent on the Internet. In such arms races, attackers are becoming more agile and their strategies are more sophisticated to escape from detection. Effective defenses demand in-depth understanding of such strategies. In this paper, we set to investigate the DDoS landscape from the perspective of the attackers. We focus on the dynamics of the attacking force, aiming to explore the strategies behind the scenes, if any. Our study is based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks across the globe in a seven-month period. Our results indicate that attackers deliberately schedule their controlled bots in a dynamic fashion, and such dynamics can be well captured by statistical distributions. Furthermore, different botnet families exhibit similar scheduling patterns, strongly suggesting their close relationship and potential collaborations. Such collaborations are further confirmed by bots rotating in multiple families, and such rotation patterns are examined and confirmed at various levels. These findings lay a promising foundation for predicting DDoS attacks in the future and aid mitigation efforts.","Despite continuous defense efforts, DDoS attacks are still very prevalent on the Internet.

Effectively mitigating cross-VM side-channel attacks by re-designing the hypervisor’s scheduler,"Li Liu, An Wang, Songqing Chen",2017,"Description CPU cache-based side channel attacks have evolved into one of the most sophisticated and threatening security and privacy concerns in today’s cloud platforms. Currently, to mitigate such attacks, frequent VM migration or dedicated resource provisions have been proposed, which are expensive in terms of performance and monetary cost.To cost-effectively mitigate these side channel attacks, in this paper, we first investigate the factors that can impact the success of the attacker in such side channel attacks. Based on our findings, we propose lightweight and generic scheduler-based defense mechanisms that can effectively mitigate such side channel attacks. Accordingly, we design, implement, and evaluate two new hypervisor scheduling schemes for this purpose. Our analysis and experimental results show that these schemes can effectively reduce side channel leakage to mitigate cross-VM attacks with little performance penalty. Our schemes are effective to not only cache based side channel attacks, but also attacks exploiting other shared resources, such as Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and Network-on-Chip (NoC).","CPU cache-based side channel attacks have evolved into one of the most sophisticated and threatening security and privacy concerns in today’s cloud platforms.

CACHING TO IMPROVE DELIVERY QUALITY,"Songqing Chen, Bo Shen, Susie Wee, Xiaodong Zhang",2004/8/10,Journal Web Content Caching and Distribution: Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop,"Segment-based proxy caching schemes have been effectively used to deliver streaming media objects. However, this approach does not always guarantee continuous delivery because the to-be-viewed segments may not be cached in the proxy in time. The potential consequence is the playback jitter at the client side due to the proxy delay in fetching these uncached segments, thus we call the problem proxy jitter. Aiming at improving the media delivery quality for segment-based caching schemes, in this paper we propose two simple and effective prefetching methods, namely, look-ahead window based prefetching and active prefetching to address the problem of proxy jitter. We focus on presenting streaming flow analyses on proxy and network resource utilizations and con-sumptions, performance potentials and limits of the two prefetching methods for different segment-based schemes under different network bandwidth condi-tions. Our study also provides some new insights into relationships between proxy caching performance and the quality of streaming. For example, we show that the objective of improving the byte hit ratio in a conventional proxy and the unique objective of minimizing the proxy jitter to deliver streaming media objects can have conflicting interests. Trace-driven simulations show the effec-tiveness of our prefetching methods, and further confirm our analyses.",

Ensemble Prediction of Spatio-Temporal Behavior of Distributed Denial of Service Attacks,"Ahmed Abusnaina, Mohammed Abuhamad, DaeHun Nyang, Songqing Chen, An Wang, David Mohaisen","DDoS attacks are an immense threat to online services, and numerous studies have been done to detect and defend against them. DDoS attacks, however, are becoming more sophisticated and launched with different purposes, making the detection and instant defense as important as analyzing the behavior of the attack during and after it takes place. To this end, studying and modeling the Spatio-temporal evolvement of DDoS attacks is essential to predict, assess, and combat the problem, since recent studies have shown the emergence of wider and more powerful adversaries. This work aims to model seven Spatiotemporal behavioral characteristics of DDoS attacks, including the attack magnitude, the adversaries’ botnet information, and the attack’s source locality down to the organization. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address all behavioral characteristics of DDoS, especially for observing patterns of botnet families and information across distributed geographical localities, for modeling and prediction during the progression of the attack. Due to the variety of underlying nature of the modeling task associated with each characteristic, we leverage the state-of-the-art deep learning methods, namely: DNN, Transformers, LSTM, and CNN, to construct an ensemble of models to capture and predict behavioral patterns of the attack. The proposed ensemble operates in two frequencies, ie, hourly and daily, to actively model and predict the attack behavior and evolvement, and oversee the effect of implementing a defense mechanism.

Online Spam Detection in Blogs: A Behavior-based Approach,"Enhua Tan, Lei Guo, Songqing Chen, Xiaodong Zhang, Yihong Eric Zhao","With the increasing usage of user generated content based social networks, spam content is surging by taking advantage of the convenience of web posting. Modern spammers in social networks insert popular keywords or even copy and paste recent articles on the web with spam links inserted, in order to evade language model based spam detection. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of spamming activities on a large commercial blog site (Yahoo! HK Blog) in 325 days covering over 6 million posts and nearly 400 thousand users. Our analysis shows that blog spammers often exhibit different behavior patterns from those of normal users, mainly being related to posting activities, advertised spam host or link properties. We have evaluated several spammer classification methods. Our evaluation results show that high accurate classification results can be achieved without using volatile textual features. These findings further motivate us to develop an online scheme for detecting spam post based on the identified spamming behavior patterns instead of content text itself.

Dynamic Load Sharing With Unknown Memory Demand of Jobs in Clustered Compute Farms£,"Songqing Chen, Xiaodong Zhang, Li Xiao","A compute farm is a pool of clustered workstations to provide high performance computing services for CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, and I/O active jobs. Existing load sharing schemes with memory considerations assume jobs’ memory demand sizes are known in advance or predictable based on users’ hints. This assumption can greatly simplify the designs and implementations of memory-centric schemes, but is not desirable in practice. Load sharing with unknown memory demand of jobs requires an insightful understanding of the effects of dynamic job interactions to memory systems and an effective usage of dynamic system information. In order to address this issue, we present three new results and contributions in this study.(1) Conducting Linux kernel instrumentations, we have collected different types of workload execution traces to quantitatively characterize job interactions, and modeled page fault behavior as a function of the overloaded memory sizes and the amount of jobs’ I/O activities.(2) Based on experimental results and collected dynamic system information, we have built a simulation model which accurately emulates the memory system operations and job migrations with virtual memory considerations.(3) We have proposed a memory-centric load sharing scheme and its variations to effectively process dynamic memory allocation demand of jobs, aiming at minimizing execution time of each individual job and maximizing distributed system throughput by dynamically migrating and remotely submitting jobs from heavily loaded machines to lightly loaded ones to eliminate or reduce page faults and to reduce the waiting time for …","Scholar articles Dynamic Load Sharing With Unknown Memory Demand of Jobs in Clustered Compute Farms£S Chen, X Zhang, L XiaoRelated articles All 3 versions ","A compute farm is a pool of clustered workstations to provide high performance computing services for CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, and I/O active jobs. Existing load sharing schemes with memory considerations assume jobs’ memory demand sizes are known in advance or predictable based on users’ hints.

PSM~-thirottling: Mnimizing Energy onsu tion,"Enhua Tani, Songqing Chen, Xiaodong Zhang","While the 802.11 power saving mode (PSM) and its enhancements can reduce power consumption by putting the wireless network interface (WNI) into sleep as much as possible, they either require additional infrastructure support, or may degrade the transmission throughput and cause additional transmission delay. These schemes are not suitable for long and bulk data transmissions with strict QoS requirements on wireless devices. With increasingly abundant bandwidth available on the Internet, we have observed that TCP congestion control is often not a constraint of bulk data transmissions as bandwidth throttling is widely used in practice.In this paper, instead of further manipulating the trade-off between the power saving and the incurred delay, we effectively explore the power saving potential by considering the bandwidth throttling on streaming/downloading servers. We propose an application-independent protocol, called PSM-throttling. With a quick detection on the TCP flow throughput, a client can","Scholar articles PSM~-thirottling: Mnimizing Energy onsu tionE Tani, S Chen, X ZhangRelated articles All 2 versions ","While the 802.11 power saving mode (PSM) and its enhancements can reduce power consumption by putting the wireless network interface (WNI) into sleep as much as possible, they either require additional infrastructure support, or may degrade the transmission throughput and cause additional transmission delay.

The Stretched Exponential Distribution of Internet Media Access Patterns,"ENHUA TAN, SONGQING CHEN, ZHEN XIAO, XIAODONG ZHANG","We have further analyzed the effectiveness of media caching with a mathematical model. Compared with Web caching under the Zipf model, media caching under the SE model is far less effective unless the cache size is enormously large. This indicates that many previous studies based on a Zipf-like assumption have potentially overestimated the media caching benefit, while an effective media caching system must be able to scale its storage size to accommodate the increase of media content over a long time. Our study provides an analytical basis for applying a P2P model rather than a client-server model to build large scale Internet media delivery systems.","Scholar articles The Stretched Exponential Distribution of Internet Media Access PatternsE TAN, S CHEN, Z XIAO, X ZHANGRelated articles All 2 versions ","We have further analyzed the effectiveness of media caching with a mathematical model.
