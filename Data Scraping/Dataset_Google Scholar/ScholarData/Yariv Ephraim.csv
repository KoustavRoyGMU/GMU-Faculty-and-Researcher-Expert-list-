Speech enhancement using a minimum-mean square error short-time spectral amplitude estimator,"Yariv Ephraim, David Malah",1984/12,"Journal IEEE Transactions on acoustics, speech, and signal processing","This paper focuses on the class of speech enhancement systems which capitalize on the major importance of the short-time spectral amplitude (STSA) of the speech signal in its perception. A system which utilizes a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) STSA estimator is proposed and then compared with other widely used systems which are based on Wiener filtering and the ""spectral subtraction"" algorithm. In this paper we derive the MMSE STSA estimator, based on modeling speech and noise spectral components as statistically independent Gaussian random variables. We analyze the performance of the proposed STSA estimator and compare it with a STSA estimator derived from the Wiener estimator. We also examine the MMSE STSA estimator under uncertainty of signal presence in the noisy observations.

A signal subspace approach for speech enhancement,"Yariv Ephraim, Harry L Van Trees",1995/7,Journal IEEE Transactions on speech and audio processing,"A comprehensive approach for nonparametric speech enhancement is developed. The underlying principle is to decompose the vector space of the noisy signal into a signal-plus-noise subspace and a noise subspace. Enhancement is performed by removing the noise subspace and estimating the clean signal from the remaining signal subspace. The decomposition can theoretically be performed by applying the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) to the noisy signal. Linear estimation of the clean signal is performed using two perceptually meaningful estimation criteria. First, signal distortion is minimized while the residual noise energy is maintained below some given threshold. This criterion results in a Wiener filter with adjustable input noise level. Second, signal distortion is minimized for a fixed spectrum of the residual noise. This criterion enables masking of the residual noise by the speech signal. It results in a …",1385
Hidden markov processes,"Yariv Ephraim, Neri Merhav",2002/6,Journal IEEE Transactions on information theory,"An overview of statistical and information-theoretic aspects of hidden Markov processes (HMPs) is presented. An HMP is a discrete-time finite-state homogeneous Markov chain observed through a discrete-time memoryless invariant channel. In recent years, the work of Baum and Petrie (1966) on finite-state finite-alphabet HMPs was expanded to HMPs with finite as well as continuous state spaces and a general alphabet. In particular, statistical properties and ergodic theorems for relative entropy densities of HMPs were developed. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimator were proved under some mild conditions. Similar results were established for switching autoregressive processes. These processes generalize HMPs.

Statistical-model-based speech enhancement systems,Yariv Ephraim,1992/10,Journal Proceedings of the IEEE,"Since the statistics of the speech signal as well as of the noise are not explicitly available, and the most perceptually meaningful distortion measure is not known, model-based approaches have recently been extensively studied and applied to the three basic problems of speech enhancement: signal estimation from a given sample function of noisy speech, signal coding when only noisy speech is available, and recognition of noisy speech signals in man-machine communication. Research on the model-based approach is integrated and put into perspective with other more traditional approaches for speech enhancement. A unified statistical approach for the three basic problems of speech enhancement is developed, using composite source models for the signal and noise and a fairly large set of distortion measures.< >",546

The derivation of the optimal estimator is based on modeling speech as a quasi-periodic signal, and on applying spectral decomposition. The optimal spectral amplitude estimator and a recently developed vector spectral subtraction amplitude estimator, are round to be nearly equivalent. The optimal spectral amplitude estimator coincides with a Wiener spectral amplitude estimator at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) values, and is found to be superior to it at low SNR values.

We focus on temporal spectrum sensing in a single narrowband channel in which a primary transmitter is either in an idle or an active state. The main advantage of the proposed model, compared to a standard hidden Markov model (HMM), is that it allows a phase-type dwell time distribution for the process in each state. This distribution significantly generalizes the geometric dwell time distribution of a standard HMM.

Enhancement is performed by removing the noise subspace and estimating the clean signal from the remaining signal subspace. The decomposition can theoretically be performed by applying the Karhunen-Loeve transform to the noisy signal. Linear estimation of the clean signal is performed using a perceptually meaningful estimation criterion. The estimator is designed by minimizing signal distortion for a fixed desired spectrum of the residual noise. This criterion enables masking of the residual noise by the speech signal. The filter is implemented as a gain function which modifies the KLT components corresponding to the signal subspace. The gain function is solely …,21
Collaborative spectrum sensing via online estimation of hidden bivariate Markov models,"Yuandao Sun, Brian L Mark, Yariv Ephraim",2016/4/27,Journal IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,"Collaborative spectrum sensing exploits multiuser diversity by combining spectrum sensing information from multiple secondary users to make joint decisions about spectrum occupancy. In hard fusion schemes, each secondary user makes a hard decision on spectrum occupancy and a fusion center makes a final decision by combining the individual hard decisions according to a fusion rule. In soft fusion schemes, each secondary user provides a signal power measurement to the fusion center, which performs further processing on the collection of all observations to make a final decision. In this paper, we propose hard and soft fusion collaborative spectrum sensing schemes based on the online hidden bivariate Markov chain modeling of the signals received by secondary users.

We model the noisy measurements of the received signal in each band as a bivariate Markov modulated Gaussian process, which can be viewed as a continuous-time bivariate Markov chain observed through Gaussian noise. The underlying bivariate Markov process allows for the characterization of …",1

"Traffic Workload Envelope for Network Performance Guarantees with Multiplexing Gain,"" IEEE Globecom 2022, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, Dec. 2022.","Massieh Kordi Boroujeny, Brian L Mark, Yariv Ephraim",2022/12,Journal IEEE Global Communications Conference,"Stochastic network calculus involves the use of a traffic bound or envelope to make admission control and resource allocation decisions for providing end-to-end quality-of-service guarantees. To apply network calculus in practice, the traffic envelope should: (i) be readily determined for an arbitrary traffic source, (ii) be enforceable by traffic regulation, and (iii) yield statistical multiplexing gain. Existing traffic envelopes typically satisfy at most two of these properties. A well-known traffic envelope based on the moment generating function (MGF) of the arrival process satisfies only the third property. We propose a new traffic envelope based on the MGF of the workload process obtained from offering the traffic to a constant service rate queue. We show that this traffic workload envelope can achieve all three properties and leads to a framework for a network service that provides stochastic delay guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of the traffic workload envelope with two bursty traffic models: Markov on-off fluid and Markov modulated Poisson Process (MMPP).",
Traffic rate network tomography with higherâ€ order cumulants,"Yariv Ephraim, Brian L Mark",2022/10,Journal Networks,"Network tomography aims at estimating sourceâ€“destination traffic rates from link traffic measurements. This inverse problem was formulated by Vardi in 1996 for Poisson traffic over networks operating under deterministic as well as random routing regimes. In this article, we expand Vardi's second-order moment matching rate estimation approach to higher-order cumulant matching with the goal of increasing the column rank of the mapping and consequently improving the rate estimation accuracy. We develop a systematic set of linear cumulant matching equations and express them compactly in terms of the Khatriâ€“Rao product. Both least squares estimation and iterative minimum I-divergence estimation are considered. We develop an upper bound on the mean squared error (MSE) in least squares rate estimation from empirical cumulants. We demonstrate that supplementing Vardi's approach with the third-order empirical cumulant reduces its minimum averaged normalized MSE in rate estimation by almost 20% when iterative minimum I-divergence estimation was used.",

Iterative Schur Complement and Multistage Wiener Filtering,"Yariv Ephraim, Michael Tinston",2010,Journal SIAM journal on matrix analysis and applications,"The multistage Wiener filter (MWF) is an iterative Schur complement procedure for estimating a scalar or a vector of random variables in the linear minimum mean square error sense. When a complementary orthogonal projector is used as a blocking matrix, intermediate vectors in the development of the MWF have singular covariance matrices, and the rationale of the MWF is undermined. For this situation, we validate the structure of the MWF by showing that it can be developed as an iterative generalized Schur complement procedure which relies on the Moore–Penrose generalized inverse. The validated filter does not require any generalized inverse, and it can be implemented as usual by using scalar Wiener filters when estimating a scalar random variable. Next, we show, under a condition which is commonly met in practice, that the MWF is a least squares reduced rank estimate of the Wiener filter from the …",
On application of the Faragó-Lugosi algorithm in speech recognition,"William JJ Roberts, Yariv Ephraim",2002/5/13,"Conference 2002 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","In 1989 a new algorithm for non-iterative global maximization of the joint likelihood function of state and observation sequences of left-right HMM's was developed by Faragó and Lugosi. The algorithm capitalizes on the fact that the state sequence of a left-right HMM is uniquely determined by the state duration occupancies, The algorithm is mostly suitable for parameter estimation from a single training sequence. Extensions to estimation from multiple sequences are possible but deemed impractical. Two alternatives are proposed for utilizing this algorithm in automatic speech recognition. The first is based on averaging the parameter estimates from individual sequences while the second uses the Faragó and Lugosi segmentation to initialize the segmental k-means or the Baum algorithm. We have implemented the algorithm and tested it in isolated digit recognition. Using the second approach, a reduction of the error …",

15.2 Speech Enhancement and Noise Reduction,Yariv Ephraim,2000,Journal Electrical Engineering Handbook,"Voice communication systems are susceptible to interfering signals normally referred to as noise. T he interfering signals may have harmful effects on the performance of any speech communication system. These effects depend on the specific system being used, on the nature of the noise and the way it interacts with the clean signal, and on the relative intensity of the noise compared to that of the signal. The latter is usually measured by the signalto-noise ratio (SNR), which is the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise. The speech communication system may simply be a recording which was performed in a noisy environment, a standard digital or analog communication system, or a speech recognition system for human-machine communication. The noise may be present at the input of the communication system, in the channel, or at the receiving end. The noise may be correlated or uncorrelated with the signal. It may accompany the clean signal in an additive, multiplicative, or any other more general manner. Examples of noise sources include competitive speech; background sounds like music, a fan, machines, door slamming, wind, and traffic; room reverberation; and white Gaussian channel noise.",

Minimum mean‐square error speech enhancement using hidden Markov models,Yariv Ephraim,1989/11,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"A minimum mean‐square error (MMSE) estimation approach for enhancing speech signals degraded by statistically independent additive noise is developed. This approach is motivated by the fact that optimal waveform coding in the MSE sense, and optimal autoregressive model vector quantization in the Itakura‐Saito sense, given noisy speech, can be performed using MMSE estimators of the speech waveform and its sample spectrum, respectively. Estimators for the clean speech signal, and for the spectral magnitude and sample spectrum of that signal, are developed, based upon hidden Markov modeling of the clean signal and the noise process. The parameters of the models for the two processes are estimated from training sequences of clean speech and noise samples. It is shown that the MMSE estimator of the clean signal comprises a weighted sum of Weiner filters, one for each state of the hidden Markov …",
