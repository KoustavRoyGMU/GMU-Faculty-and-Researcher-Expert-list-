Fast approximation of betweenness centrality through sampling,"Matteo Riondato, Evgenios M Kornaropoulos",2016/3,Journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,"Betweenness centrality is a fundamental measure in social network analysis, expressing the importance or influence of individual vertices in a network in terms of the fraction of shortest paths that pass through them. Exact computation in large networks is prohibitively expensive and fast approximation algorithms are required in these cases. We present two efficient randomized algorithms for betweenness estimation. The algorithms are based on random sampling of shortest paths and offer probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the approximation. The first algorithm estimates the betweenness of all vertices: all approximated values are within an additive factor ɛ from the real values, with probability at least 1-δ. The second algorithm focuses on the top-K vertices with highest betweenness and approximate their betweenness within a multiplicative factor ɛ, with probability at least $1-δ. This is the first algorithm that …",260
Data recovery on encrypted databases with k-nearest neighbor query leakage,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Charalampos Papamanthou, Roberto Tamassia",2019,Conference 2019 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P),"Recent works by Kellaris et al. (CCS'16) and Lacharite et al. (SP'18) demonstrated attacks of data recovery for encrypted databases that support rich queries such as range queries. In this paper, we develop the first data recovery attacks on encrypted databases supporting one-dimensional k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) queries, which are widely used in spatial data management. Our attacks exploit a generic k-NN query leakage profile: the attacker observes the identifiers of matched records. We consider both unordered responses, where the leakage is a set, and ordered responses, where the leakage is a k-tuple ordered by distance from the query point. As a first step, we perform a theoretical feasibility study on exact reconstruction, i.e., recovery of the exact plaintext values of the encrypted database. For ordered responses, we show that exact reconstruction is feasible if the attacker has additional access to some …",66
The State of the Uniform: Attacks on Encrypted Databases Beyond the Uniform Query Distribution.,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Charalampos Papamanthou, Roberto Tamassia",2020,Journal 2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P),"Recent foundational work on leakage-abuse attacks on encrypted databases has broadened our understanding of what an adversary can accomplish with a standard leakage profile. Nevertheless, all known value reconstruction attacks succeed under strong assumptions that may not hold in the real world. The most prevalent assumption is that queries are issued uniformly at random by the client. We present the first value reconstruction attacks that succeed without any knowledge about the query or data distribution. Our approach uses the search-pattern leakage, which exists in all known structured encryption schemes but has not been fully exploited so far. At the core of our method lies a support size estimator, a technique that utilizes the repetition of search tokens with the same response to estimate distances between encrypted values without any assumptions about the underlying distribution. We develop …",58
Systems and methods for securely detecting data similarities,"Evgenios Kornaropoulos, Petros Efstathopoulos",2018/4/10,Patent office US,"A computer-implemented method for securely detecting data similarities may include (1) identifying a private data object subject to comparison to determine a similarity with at least one potentially similar data object,(2) establishing a connection between a client system and a server that is not authorized to access the private data object,(3) generating a summary of the private data object by applying a summary generation protocol between the client system and the server to the private data object without exposing plaintext from the private data object to the server and without exposing a parameter of the summary generation protocol to the client system, and (4) computing the similarity between the private data object and the potentially similar data object by using the summary of the private data object and a summary of the potentially similar data object.

A novel KNN classifier for acoustic vehicle classification based on alpha-stable statistical modeling,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Panagiotis Tsakalides",2009/8/31,Conference 2009 IEEE 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing,"This paper describes a novel methodology for statistical modeling and classification of acoustic signals collected from a wireless sensor network. Our SalphaS kNN classifier is based on a variation of k-nearest neighbor algorithm. First, we perform a 1-D wavelet decomposition of the acoustic signal and we model the resulting subband coefficients using the alpha-stable distribution. Subsequently, the alpha-stable distribution parameters are estimated during feature extraction and the similarity between two acoustic signals is measured by employing a variant of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the characteristic functions of the corresponding subband representations. We evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed methodology by using actual recorded data in a vehicle classification application.",24
DAGView: an approach for visualizing large graphs,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Ioannis G Tollis",2012/9/19,Conference International Symposium on Graph Drawing,"In this paper, we propose a novel visualization framework called DAGView. The aim of DAGView is to produce clear visualizations of directed acyclic graphs in which every edge and the potential existence of a path can be immediately spotted by the user. Several criteria that users identified as important in a layout are met, such as underlying grid, crossings and bends that appear perpendicular. The main algorithm is based on the layout of directed acyclic graphs but can be extended to handle directed graphs with cycles and undirected graphs, taking into account user preferences and/or constraints. Important tasks that are used in user studies are performed efficiently within the DAGView framework.",22
Overloaded orthogonal drawings,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Ioannis G Tollis",2011/9/21,Conference International Symposium on Graph Drawing,"Orthogonal drawings are widely used for graph visualization due to their high clarity of representation. In this paper we present a technique called Overloaded Orthogonal Drawing. We first place the vertices on grid points following a relaxed version of dominance drawing, called weak dominance condition. Edge routing is implied automatically by the vertex coordinates. In order to simplify these drawings we use an overloading technique. All algorithms are simple and easy to implement and can be applied to directed acyclic graphs, planar, non-planar and also undirected graphs. We also present bounds on the number of bends and the area. Overloaded Orthogonal drawings present several interesting properties such as efficient visual edge confirmation as well as simplicity and clarity of the drawing.",22
Response-hiding encrypted ranges: revisiting security via parametrized leakage-abuse attacks,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Charalampos Papamanthou, Roberto Tamassia",2021/5/24,Conference 2021 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),"Despite a growing body of work on leakage-abuse attacks for encrypted databases, attacks on practical response-hiding constructions are yet to appear. Response-hiding constructions are superior in that they nullify access-pattern based attacks by revealing only the search token and the result size of each query. Response-hiding schemes are vulnerable to existing volume attacks, which are, however, based on strong assumptions such as the uniform query assumption or the dense database assumption. More crucially, these attacks only apply to schemes that cannot be deployed in practice (ones with quadratic storage and increased leakage) while practical response-hiding schemes (Demertzis et al. [SIGMOD’16] and Faber et al. [ESORICS’15]) have linear storage and less leakage. Due to these shortcomings, the value of existing volume attacks on response-hiding schemes is unclear.In this work, we close the …",19

Weak dominance drawings for directed acyclic graphs,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Ioannis G Tollis",2012/9/19,Conference International Symposium on Graph Drawing,"The dominance drawing method has many important aesthetic properties, including small number of bends, good vertex placement, and symmetry display [1]. Furthermore, it encapsulates the aspect of characterizing the transitive closure of the digraph by means of a geometric dominance relation among the vertices. A dominance drawing Γ of a planar st-graph G is a drawing, such that for any two vertices u and v there is a directed path from u to v in G if and only if X(u) ≤ X(v) and Y(u) ≤ Y(v) in Γ [1]. Here we study weak dominance drawings where for any two vertices u and v if there is a directed path from u to v in G then X(u) ≤ X(v) and Y(u) ≤ Y(v) in Γ.",15
A Visualization Framework and User Studies for Overloaded Orthogonal Drawings,"Walter Didimo, Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Fabrizio Montecchiani, Ioannis G Tollis",2017,Journal Computer Graphics Forum,"Overloaded orthogonal drawing (OOD) is a recent graph visualization style specifically conceived for directed graphs. It merges the advantages of some popular drawing conventions like layered drawings and orthogonal drawings, and provides additional support for some common analysis tasks. We present a visualization framework called DAGView, which implements algorithms and graphical features for the OOD style. Besides the algorithm for acyclic digraphs, the DAGView framework implements extensions to visualize both digraphs with cycles and undirected graphs, with the additional possibility of taking into account user preferences and constraints. It also supports an interactive visualization of clustered digraphs, based on the use of strongly connected components. Moreover, we describe an experimental user study, aimed to investigate the usability of OOD within the DAGView framework. The results of …",9
BeeTrace: A Unified Platform for Secure Contact Tracing that Breaks Data Silos,"Xiaoyuan Liu, Ni Trieu, Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Dawn Song",2020/7/5,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.02285,"Contact tracing is an important method to control the spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19. However, existing contact tracing methods alone cannot provide sufficient coverage and do not successfully address privacy concerns of the participating entities. Current solutions do not utilize the huge volume of data stored in business databases and individual digital devices. This information is typically stored in data silos and cannot be used due to regulations in place. To successfully unlock the potential of contact tracing, we need to consider both data utilization from multiple sources and the privacy of the participating parties. To this end, we propose BeeTrace, a unified platform that breaks data silos and deploys state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols to guarantee privacy goals.",7
Algorithms and Bounds for Overloaded Orthogonal Drawings,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Ioannis G Tollis",2016,Journal J. Graph Algorithms Appl,"Orthogonal drawings are widely used for graph visualization due to their high clarity and ease of representation. But when it comes to highdegree and massive graphs, even orthogonal drawings have difficulties producing a clean and simple visualization. In this paper we present a technique called Overloaded Orthogonal Drawing that greatly improves the readability by proposing a new vertex placement and reframing the orthogonal edge routing approach. We first place the vertices on grid points following a relaxed version of dominance drawing, called weak dominance condition. Edge routing is implied automatically by the vertex coordinates.

Auditable data structures,"Michael T Goodrich, Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Michael Mitzenmacher, Roberto Tamassia",2017/4/26,Conference 2017 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P),"The classic notion of history-independence guarantees that if a data structure is ever observed, only its current contents are revealed, not the history of operations that built it. This powerful concept has applications, for example, to e-voting and data retention compliance, where data structure histories should be private. The concept of weak history-independence (WHI) assumes only a single observation will ever occur, while strong history-independence (SHI) allows for multiple observations at arbitrary times. WHI constructions tend to be fast, but provide no repeatability, while SHI constructions provide unlimited repeatability, but tend to be slow. We introduce auditable data structures, where an auditor can observe data structures at arbitrary times (as in SHI), but we relax the unrealistic restriction that data structures cannot react to observations, since in most applications of history-independence, data owners know …",5
More practical and secure history-independent hash tables,"Michael T Goodrich, Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Michael Mitzenmacher, Roberto Tamassia",2016/9/26,Conference European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS),"Direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting systems have been used in several countries including United States, India, and the Netherlands to name a few. A common flaw that was discovered by the security researchers was that the votes were stored sequentially according to the time they were cast, which allows an attacker to break the anonymity of the voters. Subsequent research pointed out the connection between vote storage and the privacy property history-independence. In a weakly history-independent data structure, every possible sequence of operations consistent with the current set of items is equally likely to have occurred. In a strongly history-independent data structure, items must be stored in a canonical way, i.e., for any set of items, there is only one possible memory representation. Strong history-independence implies weak history-independence but considerably constrains the design …",5
Adversarial examples for k-nearest neighbor classifiers based on higher-order voronoi diagrams,"Chawin Sitawarin, Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Dawn Song, David Wagner",2021/5/21,Conference Thirty-Fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems,"Adversarial examples are a widely studied phenomenon in machine learning models. While most of the attention has been focused on neural networks, other practical models also suffer from this issue. In this work, we propose an algorithm for evaluating the adversarial robustness of -nearest neighbor classification, ie, finding a minimum-norm adversarial example. Diverging from previous proposals, we propose the first geometric approach by performing a search that expands outwards from a given input point. On a high level, the search radius expands to the nearby higher-order Voronoi cells until we find a cell that classifies differently from the input point. To scale the algorithm to a large , we introduce approximation steps that find perturbation with smaller norm, compared to the baselines, in a variety of datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the structural properties of a dataset where our approach outperforms the competition.",4
Dominance drawing of non-planar graphs,Evgenios M Kornaropoulos,2012,"Institution Masters Thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Crete","In information technology, big data is a term used to describe data sets so large and complex that they become awkward to work and analyze. Difficulties include capture, storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization. In this work we focus in the latter part, specifically we study the visualization of graphs. The need for simple and intuitive visualization techniques is more imminent than ever. In this thesis we propose a new framework for visualizing graphs. We extend the so-called Dominance Drawing method, by relaxing some constraints in order to include the much broader family of directed acyclic graphs. We introduce a new computational problem called Weak Dominance Placement, which we prove NP-complete using notions from the field of Order Theory. We offer simple bounds and properties as well as three heuristic algorithms in order to obtain locally optimal solutions.",4
Leakage Inversion: Towards Quantifying Privacy in Searchable Encryption,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Nathaniel Moyer, Charalampos Papamanthou, Alexandros Psomas",2022/11/7,Book Proceedings of the 2022 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"Searchable encryption (SE) provides cryptographic guarantees that a user can efficiently search over encrypted data while only disclosing patterns about the data, also known as leakage. Recently, the community has developed leakage-abuse attacks that shed light on what an attacker can infer about the underlying sensitive information using the aforementioned leakage. A glaring missing piece in this effort is the absence of a systematic and rigorous method that quantifies the privacy guarantees of SE.",2
The Price of Tailoring the Index to Your Data: Poisoning Attacks on Learned Index Structures,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Silei Ren, Roberto Tamassia",2020/8/1,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.00297,"The concept of learned index structures relies on the idea that the input-output functionality of a database index can be viewed as a prediction task and, thus, be implemented using a machine learning model instead of traditional algorithmic techniques. This novel angle for a decades-old problem has inspired numerous exciting results in the intersection of machine learning and data structures. However, the main advantage of learned index structures, i.e., the ability to adjust to the data at hand via the underlying ML-model, can become a disadvantage from a security perspective as it could be exploited. In this work, we present the first study of poisoning attacks on learned index structures. The required poisoning approach is different from all previous works since the model under attack is trained on a cumulative distribution function (CDF) and, thus, every injection on the training set has a cascading impact on multiple data values. We formulate the first poisoning attacks on linear regression models trained on the CDF, which is a basic building block of the proposed learned index structures. We generalize our poisoning techniques to attack a more advanced two-stage design of learned index structures called recursive model index (RMI), which has been shown to outperform traditional B-Trees. We evaluate our attacks on real-world and synthetic datasets under a wide variety of parameterizations of the model and show that the error of the RMI increases up to  and the error of its second-stage models increases up to .",2
The Case of Adversarial Inputs for Secure Similarity Approximation Protocols,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Petros Efstathopoulos",2019/6/17,Conference 2019 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P),"Computing similarity between high-dimensional data is a fundamental problem in data mining and information retrieval, with numerous applications-such as e-discovery and patient similarity. To address the relevant performance and scalability challenges, approximation methods are employed. A common characteristic among all privacy-preserving approximation protocols based on sketching is that the sketching is performed locally and is based on common randomness. Inspired by the power of attacks on machine learning models, we introduce the study of adversarial inputs for secure similarity approximations. To formally capture the framework of this family of attacks we present a new threat model where a party is assumed to use the common randomness to perturb her input 1) offline, and 2) before the execution of any secure protocol, so as to steer the approximation result to a maliciously chosen output.

Breaking and Fixing Secure Similarity Approximations: Dealing with Adversarially Perturbed Inputs,"Evgenios M Kornaropoulos, Petros Efstathopoulos",2017,Journal IACR ePrint,"Computing similarity between data is a fundamental problem in information retrieval and data mining. To address the relevant performance and scalability challenges, approximation methods are employed for large-scale similarity computation. A common characteristic among all privacy-preserving approximation protocols based on sketching is that the sketching is performed locally and is based on common randomness. In the semi-honest model the input to the sketching algorithm is independent of the common randomness. We, however, consider a new threat model where a party is allowed to use the common randomness to perturb her input 1) offline, and 2) before the execution of any secure protocol so as to steer the approximation result to a maliciously chosen output. We formally define perturbation attacks under this adversarial model and propose two attacks on the well-studied techniques of minhash and cosine sketching. We demonstrate the power of perturbation attacks by measuring their success on synthetic and real data. To mitigate such perturbation attacks we propose a server-aided architecture, where an additional party, the server, assists in the secure similarity approximation by handling the common randomness as private data. We revise and introduce the necessary secure protocols so as to apply minhash and cosine sketching techniques in the server-aided architecture. Our implementation demonstrates that this new design can mitigate offline perturbation attacks without sacrificing the efficiency and scalability of the reconstruction protocol.",2
