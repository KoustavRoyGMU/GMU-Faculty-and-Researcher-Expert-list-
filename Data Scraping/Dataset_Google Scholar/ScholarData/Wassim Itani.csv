CENTERA: A Centralized Trust-Based Efficient Routing Protocol with Authentication for Wireless Sensor Networks,"Ayman Tajeddine, Ayman Kayssi, Ali Chehab, Imad Elhajj, Wassim Itani",2015/2/2,Journal Sensors,"In this paper, we present CENTERA, a CENtralized Trust-based Efficient Routing protocol with an appropriate authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks (WSN). CENTERA utilizes the more powerful base station (BS) to gather minimal neighbor trust information from nodes and calculate the best routes after isolating different types of “bad” nodes. By periodically accumulating these simple local observations and approximating the nodes' battery lives, the BS draws a global view of the network, calculates three quality metrics—maliciousness, cooperation, and compatibility—and evaluates the Data Trust and Forwarding Trust values of each node. Based on these metrics, the BS isolates “bad”, “misbehaving” or malicious nodes for a certain period, and put some nodes on probation. CENTERA increases the node's bad/probation level with repeated “bad” behavior, and decreases it otherwise. Then it uses a very efficient method to distribute the routing information to “good” nodes. Based on its target environment, and if required, CENTERA uses an authentication scheme suitable for severely constrained nodes, ranging from the symmetric RC5 for safe environments under close administration, to pairing-based cryptography (PBC) for hostile environments with a strong attacker model. We simulate CENTERA using TOSSIM and verify its correctness and show some energy calculations.",38

This paper tackles the problem of enhancing the energy consumption of cloud data centers by proposing three energy aware approaches. Each approach includes its innovative job classification model and its novel VM placement strategy. The job classification model classifies cloud users’ jobs before serving these jobs. The model identifies common patterns for the submitted jobs and predicts their types, and accordingly, the set of users’ jobs is classified into subsets.

StrIdE,"Rima Deghaili, Ali Chehab, Ayman Kayssi, Wassim Itani",2010,"Description This paper presents STRIDE: a Secure framework for modeling Trust-pRIvacy tradDEoffs in distributed computing environments. STRIDE aims at achieving the right privacy-trust tradeoff among distributed systems entities. This is done by establishing a set of secure mechanisms for quantifying the privacy loss and the corresponding trust gain required by a given network transaction. The privacy-trust quantiication process allows the service requestor and provider to create the required trust levels necessary for executing the transaction while minimizing the privacy loss incurred. Moreover, STRIDE supports communication anonymity by associating each communicating entity with an administrative group. In this way, the identiication information of the communicating entities is anonymously masked by the identiication of their respective groups. The conidentiality, authenticity and integrity of data communication are ensured using appropriate cryptographic mechanisms. Moreover, data sent between groups is saved from dissemination by a self-destruction process. STRIDE provides a context-aware model supporting agents with various privacy-trust characteristics and behaviors. The system is implemented on the Java-based Aglets platform.","This paper presents STRIDE: a Secure framework for modeling Trust-pRIvacy tradDEoffs in distributed computing environments.

"SPARTA: a Secure, Policy-Driven Architecture for Content Distribution and Storage in Centralized Wireless Networks",Wassim Itani Ayman Kayssi Ali Chehab,"This paper presents SPARTA (Secure, Policy-driven, ARchitecture for content disTribution and storAge), a secure, policy-driven architecture for enterprise applications operating in centralized wireless environments. SPARTA supports end-to-end client authentication, data integrity and confidentiality. The security services provided by SPARTA are customized and controlled by easily configurable security policies which specify several security-related attributes, classify network and locally-stored data based on sensitivity and content, and provide an abstraction for the communication and messaging between the client and the server. In addition, SPARTA provides a standard Application Programming Interface (API) that conceals to a great extent the complexity of security operations and programming from the application. SPARTA was designed in a platform-neutral manner and can be implemented on a wide range of wireless clients ranging from low-end platforms such as the Java 2 Mobile Edition/Connected Limited Device Configuration (J2ME/CLDC) on limited-memory mobile devices to Personal Java and the. Net Compact Framework on PDAs. On the server side, SPARTA can be implemented on any of the available enterprise server platforms.

Energy-Efficient Incremental Integrity for Securing Storage in Mobile Cloud Computing,,,,,
Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems,"Auday Al-Dulaimy, Wassim Itani, Rached Zantout, Ahmed Zekri","To meet the growing demands on cloud services and applications, a sizeable number of large scale cloud data centers, hosting thousands of heterogeneous servers, is established by cloud service providers. The ever growth in establishing cloud data centers is accompanied by consuming enormous amounts of energy. Thus, proposing efficient management approaches to reduce the energy consumption in cloud data centers becomes a top priority for ensuring the scalability of the cloud computing architecture. In general, the main source of energy overconsumption in today’s data centers is due to the inefficient use of the physical servers’ resources, which results in poor server utilization patterns. So, the key aspect is to utilize the physical resources optimally while serving the cloud user demands. This paper investigates the design and implementation of virtual machine management strategies for energy efficient cloud data centers. Particularly, it considers the processes of virtual machine placement and virtual machine consolidation in enhancing the energy efficiency in cloud infrastructures. While addressing the virtual machine placement problem is important, virtual machine consolidation is even more important to enable continuous reorganization of the already-placed virtual machines on the least number of physical machines. This results in reducing the number of active physical machines by leveraging live virtual machine migration enabled by the virtualization concept. Moreover, since the virtual machine migration operations consume additional energy, the frequency of VM migrations needs to be limited and controlled as well.

NNSRAM-Clustering Based Energy Efficient System for Wireless Sensor Networks,"Nayif Saleh, Ali Haidar, Wassim Itani, Hiroyuki Shirahama","In recent years, the number of wireless sensor network deployments for real life applications has increased spectacularly. But still the energy problem remains one of the major barriers somehow preventing the complete exploitation of this technology. Sensor nodes are typically powered by batteries with a limited lifetime and, even when additional energy can be harvested from the environment, it remains a limited resource to be consumed. Efficient energy management is a key requirement for any wireless sensor network. A neural network static random access memory implementation in a clustering based system for energy-constrained WSNs is proposed in this paper. The scheme is about high energy efficiency by reducing the total amount of energy requirement in storage and transmissions during the data dissemination process.
