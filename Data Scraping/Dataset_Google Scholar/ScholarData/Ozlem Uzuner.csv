De-identification of patient notes with recurrent neural networks,"Franck Dernoncourt, Ji Young Lee, Ozlem Uzuner, Peter Szolovits",2017/5/1,Journal Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association," Objective: Patient notes in electronic health records (EHRs) may contain critical information for medical investigations. However, the vast majority of medical investigators can only access de-identified notes, in order to protect the confidentiality of patients. In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines 18 types of protected health information that needs to be removed to de-identify patient notes. Manual de-identification is impractical given the size of electronic health record databases, the limited number of researchers with access to non-de-identified notes, and the frequent mistakes of human annotators. A reliable automated de-identification system would consequently be of high value.",380

Can linguistic predictors detect fraudulent financial filings?,"Sunita Goel, Jagdish Gangolly, Sue R Faerman, Ozlem Uzuner",2010,Journal Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting," ABSTRACT: Extensive research has been done on the analytical and empirical examination of financial data in annual reports to detect fraud; however, there is scant research on the analysis of text in annual reports to detect fraud. The basic premise of this research is that there are clues hidden in the text that can be detected to determine the likelihood of fraud. In this research, we examine both the verbal content and the presentation style of the qualitative portion of the annual reports using natural language processing tools and explore linguistic features that distinguish fraudulent annual reports from nonfraudulent annual reports. Our results indicate that employment of linguistic features is an effective means for detecting fraud. We were able to improve the prediction accuracy of our fraud detection model from initial baseline results of 56.75 percent accuracy, using a “bag of words” approach, to 89.51 …",131

A de-identifier for medical discharge summaries,"Özlem Uzuner, Tawanda C Sibanda, Yuan Luo, Peter Szolovits",2008/1/1,Journal Artificial intelligence in medicine,"OBJECTIVE: Clinical records contain significant medical information that can be useful to researchers in various disciplines. However, these records also contain personal health information (PHI) whose presence limits the use of the records outside of hospitals. The goal of de-identification is to remove all PHI from clinical records. This is a challenging task because many records contain foreign and misspelled PHI; they also contain PHI that are ambiguous with non-PHI. These complications are compounded by the linguistic characteristics of clinical records. For example, medical discharge summaries, which are studied in this paper, are characterized by fragmented, incomplete utterances and domain-specific language; they cannot be fully processed by tools designed for lay language. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this paper, we show that we can de-identify medical discharge summaries using a de-identifier …",120

Three approaches to automatic assignment of ICD-9-CM codes to radiology reports,"Ira Goldstein, Anna Arzumtsyan, Özlem Uzuner",2007,Journal AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,"We describe and evaluate three systems for automatically predicting the ICD-9-CM codes of radiology reports from short excerpts of text. The first system benefits from an open source search engine, Lucene, and takes advantage of the relevance of reports to one another based on individual words. The second uses BoosTexter, a boosting algorithm based on n-grams (sequences of consecutive words) and s-grams (sequences of non-consecutive words) extracted from the reports. The third employs a set of hand-crafted rules that capture lexical elements (short, meaningful, strings of words) derived from BoosTexter’s n-grams, and that are enhanced by shallow semantic information in the form of negation, synonymy, and uncertainty. Our evaluation shows that semantic information significantly contributes to ICD-9-CM coding with lexical elements. Also, a simple hand-crafted rule-based system with lexical elements …",96

A cascade of classifiers for extracting medication information from discharge summaries,"Scott Russell Halgrim, Fei Xia, Imre Solti, Eithon Cadag, Özlem Uzuner",2011/12,Conference Journal of biomedical semantics,"Extracting medication information from clinical records has many potential applications, and recently published research, systems, and competitions reflect an interest therein. Much of the early extraction work involved rules and lexicons, but more recently machine learning has been applied to the task. We present a hybrid system consisting of two parts. The first part, field detection, uses a cascade of statistical classifiers to identify medication-related named entities. The second part uses simple heuristics to link those entities into medication events. The system achieved performance that is comparable to other approaches to the same task. This performance is further improved by adding features that reference external medication name lists. This study demonstrates that our hybrid approach outperforms purely statistical or rule-based systems. The study also shows that a cascade of classifiers works better than a single classifier in extracting medication information. The system is available as is upon request from the first author.",27

In comparison to structured elements of electronic health records, free text conveys individualized patient history and assessments, providing a rich context for clinical decision making. Natural language processing (NLP), one foundational technique used in text analytics, has repeatedly demonstrated its feasibility to unlock information described in free text efficiently and effectively. The development of text analytics beyond basic NLP has been facilitated by increased adoption of machine learning techniques. In particular, recent years have witnessed the greatest leap in performance in the history of computer science following the arrival of deep learning. Human-like performance in a wide range of text analytics tasks has opened the gate to its routine use in various clinical care settings. Unfortunately, clinical narratives are yet to be routinely analysed on a large scale. This is largely associated with accessibility of clinical narratives in relation to privacy concerns. Another reason for the slow adoption of text analytics in routine clinical care is the scarcity of evidence that clearly demonstrates its utility in the wider context of clinical applications.",16

Ideally, deidentification systems should be reliable and generalizable. Previous research has focused on improving performance but has not examined generalizability. This paper investigates both performance and generalizability. To improve current state-ofthe-art performance based on long short-term memory (LSTM) units, we introduce a system that uses gated recurrent units (GRUs) and deep contextualized word representations, both of which have never been applied to de-identification. We measure performance and generalizability of each system using the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth and 2016 CEGS N-GRID deidentification datasets. We show that deep contextualized word representations improve state-of-the-art performance, while the benefit of switching LSTM units with GRUs is not significant. The generalizability of de-identification system significantly improved with deep contextualized word representations; in addition, LSTM units-based system is more generalizable than the GRUs-based system.",10

Two approaches to assertion classification,"Özlem Uzuner, Xiaoran Zhang, Tawanda Sibanda",2008,Journal AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,"We present a study of two approaches to assertion classification: one of these approaches, Extended NegEx, extends the rule-based NegEx algorithm to cover alter-association assertions; the other, SNegEx, is a machine learning approach and explores the contribution of lexical and syntactic context to assertion classification. Both approaches determine whether a problem, as asserted in a patient record, is present, absent, or uncertain in the patient, or associated with someone other than the patient.",1

Performance of Automatic De-identification Across Different Note Types,"Nicholas Dobbins, David Wayne, Kahyun Lee, Özlem Uzuner, Meliha Yetisgen",2021/2/17,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.11032,"Free-text clinical notes detail all aspects of patient care and have great potential to facilitate quality improvement and assurance initiatives as well as advance clinical research. However, concerns about patient privacy and confidentiality limit the use of clinical notes for research. As a result, the information documented in these notes remains unavailable for most researchers. De-identification (de-id), i.e., locating and removing personally identifying protected health information (PHI), is one way of improving access to clinical narratives. However, there are limited off-the-shelf de-identification systems able to consistently detect PHI across different data sources and medical specialties. In this abstract, we present the performance of a state-of-the art de-id system called NeuroNER1 on a diverse set of notes from University of Washington (UW) when the models are trained on data from an external institution (Partners Healthcare) vs. from the same institution (UW). We present results at the level of PHI and note types.",

Normalizing Adverse Events using Recurrent Neural Networks with Attention,"Kahyun Lee, Özlem Uzuner",2020,Journal AMIA Summits on Translational Science Proceedings,"Adverse events (AEs) are undesirable outcomes of medication administration and cause many hospitalizations as well as even deaths per year. Information about AEs can enable their prevention. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can identify AEs from narratives and match them to a structured terminology. We propose a novel neural network for AE normalization utilizing bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) with attention mechanism that generalizes to diverse datasets. We train this network to first learn a framework for general AE normalization and then to learn the specifics of the task on individual corpora. Our results on the datasets from the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2017-ADR track, FDA adverse drug event evaluation shared task, and the Social Media Mining for Health Applications Workshop & Shared Task 2019 show that our approach outperforms widely used rule-based …",

Role of preferred terminology in the classification of medical reports,"Ira Goldstein, Ozlem Uzuner",2009/9/14,Conference 2009 24th International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences,"We explore the role of the unified medical language system metathesaurus preferred terms in multi-label classification of medical reports. We use preferred terms to represent lexically-disparate but semantically-equivalent medical concepts. We experiment with two classifiers: one based upon Lucene and the other based upon BoosTexter. We find the performance of these systems fails to show consistent improvement when their input is enriched with preferred terminology. Our analysis shows that in our data, some reports can be correctly classified not only in the absence of preferred terms, but in some cases, in the absence of direct references to the diseases themselves.",
Focus on i2b2 Obesity NLP Challenge,ÖZLEM UZUNER,2009,Journal J Am Med Inform Assoc,"In order to survey, facilitate, and evaluate studies of medical language processing on clinical narratives, i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside) organized its second challenge and workshop. This challenge focused on automatically extracting information on obesity and fifteen of its most common comorbidities from patient discharge summaries. For each patient, obesity and any of the comorbidities could be Present, Absent, or Questionable (ie, possible) in the patient, or Unmentioned in the discharge summary of the patient. i2b2 provided data for, and invited the development of, automated systems that can classify obesity and its comorbidities into these four classes based on individual discharge summaries. This article refers to obesity and comorbidities as diseases. It refers to the categories Present, Absent, Questionable, and Unmentioned as classes. The task of classifying obesity and its comorbidities is called the Obesity Challenge.",

Machine Learning and Rule-based,"Özlem Uzuner, Xiaoran Zhang, Tawanda Sibanda","Objectives: The authors study two approaches to assertion classification. One of these approaches, Extended NegEx (ENegEx), extends the rule-based NegEx algorithm to cover alter-association assertions; the other, Statistical Assertion Classifier (StAC), presents a machine learning solution to assertion classification.Design: For each mention of each medical problem, both approaches determine whether the problem, as asserted by the context of that mention, is present, absent, or uncertain in the patient, or associated with someone other than the patient. The authors use these two systems to (1) extend negation and uncertainty extraction to recognition of alter-association assertions,(2) determine the contribution of lexical and syntactic context to assertion classification, and (3) test if a machine learning approach to assertion classification can be as generally applicable and useful as its rule-based counterparts.Measurements: The authors evaluated assertion classification approaches with precision, recall, and F-measure. Results: The ENegEx algorithm is a general algorithm that can be directly applied to new corpora. Despite being based on machine learning, StAC can also be applied out-of-the-box to new corpora and achieve similar generality.Conclusion: The StAC models that are developed on discharge summaries can be successfully applied to radiology reports. These models benefit the most from words found in the 4 word window of the target and can outperform ENegEx.","Scholar articles Machine Learning and Rule-basedÖ Uzuner, X Zhang, T SibandaRelated articles All 2 versions ","Objectives: The authors study two approaches to assertion classification.
