Impact of electronic toll collection and electronic screening on heavy-duty vehicle emissions,"Mohan Venigalla, Michael Krimmer",2006,Journal Transportation research record,"The proliferation of electronic toll collection (ETC) mechanisms such as E-ZPass has a positive effect in reducing automobile emissions at toll plazas because of decreased acceleration, deceleration, and idling events. Modeling tools such as the California Modal Emissions Model can be used to measure the emissions impacts of ETC and other electronic screening (e-screening) facilities only on light-duty gasoline-fueled vehicle operations. No such tools exist for modeling of the emissions impacts of ETC and e-screening facilities on heavy-duty vehicle operations. This paper presents a speed profile discretization (SPD) technique for modeling emissions at ETC and e-screening facilities. The SPD technique is based on the MOBILE6.2 method of representing vehicle miles of travel in various speed bins. The technique defines an emissions influence zone within which speed profiles are altered and further determine …",804

A specialized equilibrium assignment algorithm for air quality modeling,"Mohan M Venigalla, Arun Chatterjee, Michael S Bronzini",1999/1/1,Journal Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment,"A multiple user class equilibrium assignment algorithm is formulated to determine vehicle trips and the vehicle miles of travel (VMT) in various operating modes on highway links. A heuristic solution algorithm based on the Frank–Wolfe decomposition of the equilibrium assignment problem is presented. The treatment of intrazonal trips, which are very important for emission studies is also discussed. The solution algorithm is implemented in a traffic assignment program for emission studies, referred to as TAPES. The use of the algorithm is demonstrated through a TAPES model case study on a Charlotte, NC network database for 1990 AM peak period.

"Reaping the benefits of genomic and proteomic research: Intellectual property rights, innovation, and public health",National Research Council,2006/4/9,Publisher National Academies Press,"The patenting and licensing of human genetic material and proteins represents an extension of intellectual property (IP) rights to naturally occurring biological material and scientific information, much of it well upstream of drugs and other disease therapies. This report concludes that IP restrictions rarely impose significant burdens on biomedical research, but there are reasons to be apprehensive about their future impact on scientific advances in this area. The report recommends 13 actions that policy-makers, courts, universities, and health and patent officials should take to prevent the increasingly complex web of IP protections from getting in the way of potential breakthroughs in genomic and proteomic research. It endorses the National Institutes of Health guidelines for technology licensing, data sharing, and research material exchanges and says that oversight of compliance should be strengthened. It recommends enactment of a statutory exception from infringement liability for research on a patented invention and raising the bar somewhat to qualify for a patent on upstream research discoveries in biotechnology. With respect to genetic diagnostic tests to detect patient mutations associated with certain diseases, the report urges patent holders to allow others to perform the tests for purposes of verifying the results.",54

Travel demand forecasting for urban transportation planning,"Arun Chatterjee, Mohan M Venigalla",2004,Book Handbook of Transportation Engineering,"The basic purpose of transportation planning and management is to match transportation supply with travel demand, which represents ‘need’. A thorough understanding of existing travel pattern is necessary for identifying and analyzing existing traffic related problems. Detailed data on current travel pattern and traffic volumes are needed also for developing travel forecasting/prediction models. The prediction of future travel demand is an essential task of the long-range transportation planning process for determining strategies for accommodating future needs. These strategies may include land use policies, pricing programs, and expansion of transportation supply–highways and transit service.",47
An analysis of island models in evolutionary computation,Zbigniew Maciej Skolicki,2007,Institution George Mason University,"Island models (IMs) are a class of distributed evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in which the population is split into multiple sub-populations called islands.

Prediction models for free flow speed on urban streets,"Asma Tayyab Ali, Aimee Flannery, Mohan M Venigalla",2007,Source Transportation Research Board 86th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"This paper investigates the relationship between vehicle free flow speed and geometric variables on urban street segments. Geometric and spot speed data were collected from 35 different two lane segments located in Fairfax County in Virginia. To gain a better understanding of the relationships between free flow speed and geometric variables, speed data were visualized and descriptive statistics were computed. In addition to this, linear regression models were developed to estimate the relationship between mean free flow speed and roadside variables and 85th percentile free flow speed and roadside variables. The results showed a significant impact of posted speed limit on free flow speed. The predicted mean free speed at sites with 45 mph posted speed was found to be 5 mph and 8 mph higher than sites with 40 mph and 35 mph posted speed respectively. The other significant factors were found to be affecting free flow speed were the presence or absence of median and spacing between the signals.",43

Start modes of trips for mobile source emissions modeling,"Mohan Venigalla, Terry Miller, Arun Chatterjee",1995,Journal Transportation Research Record,"An important determinant of vehicle emissions during a trip is the engine temperature at trip start. A trip start may be classified as a cold start or a hot start depending on the emission control equipment and the duration of engine shut-off period before starting the engine. Cold starts are usually. associated with higher concentrations of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons than are hot starts. The emission modeling process uses these start modes as direct or indirect inputs to procedures or models that would be used to determine the portion of vehicle miles traveled in transient and stabilized operating modes. A methodology for determining the operating· mode fractions at trip ends is shown. Specifically, a comprehensive analysis of personal travel data available in Nationwide Passenger Transportation Survey data is performed for deriving start mode fractions at trip origins and operating mode fractions at trip destination points. Start mode fractions as cold starts and hot starts are derived for different trip purposes and for each hour of the day. It was observed that the trip purpose is the most important explanatory variable for variance in cold starts, followed by the temporal variables such as the time of day at which the trip is made. The sizes of an urban area and individual metropolitan statistical areas are found to be the two most appropriate spatial variables for which aggregated start mode percentages may be derived. The start mode fractions derived from this methodology will be useful for a variety of mobile source emission modeling exercises.",33
Driver-Related Factors Involved With Truck Accidents.,"Arun Chatterjee, Ernest Cadotte, N Stamatiadis, H Sink, M Venigalla, G Gaides",1996,Journal Journal of Safety Research,"Driver failure is recognized to be an important cause of highway accidents involving heavy trucks.  Past research pointed out that such factors as fatigue and inadequate training may contribute significantly to a driver failure.  Traditional accident data bases available from the departments of transportation in Tennessee and Kentucky were analyzed, but these did not have sufficient evidence to confirm the role of fatigue in truck accidents. The past accident reports filed by the inspectors of the Tennessee Public Service Commission contained several interesting information items that are not found in accident reports completed by police officers.  However, human factors such as fatigue could not be captured explicitly in these reports.The approach that was successful in generalizing interesting information on human factors was the use of focus group discussions with truck drivers themselves.  The findings of four focus groups clearly revealed several problem areas.  It was found that a combination of factors, which include indirect pressure from dispatchers, is forcing the drivers to work long hours under unsafe conditions.  Truck drivers are very frustrated.  Workable solutions must be found in cooperation with the drivers to improve the present situation.",32
Variance reduction applied to urban network traffic simulation,"Ajay K Rathi, Mohan M Venigalla",1992,"Journal Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, (1365)","This paper describes and illustrates the effectiveness of variance reduction techniques that user can apply to improve the efficiency and reliability of simulation experiments with the TRAF-NETSIM simulation model. The two variance reduction techniques, antithetic variates and common random numbers, reduce the variance of simulation output by replacing the original sampling procedure by a new procedure that yields the same parameter estimate but with a smaller variance. Thus, the user can obtain greater amount of statistical accuracy for the same number of simulation runs. A recent modification in the stochastic sampling process has made the TRAF-NETSIM model amenable to these variance reduction techniques, and allows the user to apply these techniques with minimal additional effort. The effectiveness of these techniques is evaluated through an analysis of simulation output from two TRAF-NETSIM data sets. The estimated values and variances are computed for some representative measures of effectiveness after 10, 20, and 30 replications. The results of this study indicate that both techniques are quite effective in reducing variance of the model output. By using the antithetic variates sampling procedure, the variance of simulation parameter estimates can be reduced by as much as 88 percent. In all cases studied, better statistical precision is obtained by making two-thirds fewer simulations than under conventional multiple replications-based experimentation. The common random number strategy also reduces the variance but is not as effective as the antithetic variates technique in this case study.",28
GIS-based engineering management service functions: taking GIS beyond mapping for municipal governments,"Mohan M Venigalla, Bo H Baik",2007/9,Journal Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering,"A geographic information system (GIS) is found to be a platform of choice for meeting the needs of several core engineering functions.

Alternative operating mode fractions to federal test procedure mode mix for mobile source emissions modeling,"Mohan Venigalla, Terry Miller, Arun Chatterjee",1995,Journal Transportation Research Record,"An emission inventory is a key component of an air quality control program. The emission rates of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are sensitive to the variations in the inputs related to cold transient, hot transient, and hot stabilized operating mode fractions. Therefore it is important to provide realistic values for these paramet~ rs while modeling emissions using air quality models such as the MOBILE model. The objeCtive of the research presented is to derive aggregate operating mode fractions as alternatives to the federal test procedure (FTP) mode mix on the basis of a detailed analysis of personal travel data. The data source used for the analysis of personal travel information is the 1990 Nationwide Personal Travel Survey. Issues related to data quality, screening, and aggregation are discussed. After determining of the percentages of start mode as cold starts and hot starts, the percentages of vehicle miles of travel (VMT) operating in different modes are derived by trip purpose and for different time periods. The VMT weighted operating mode fractions derived from these start mode fractions indicated a significant difference from the FTP operating mode mix. It is observed that the FTP operating mode mix generally underestimates the portion of travel in cold transient mode. Also, it is observed that the percentage of VMT in cold transient mode decreases with the increase in the size of the urban area.",27

The findings reinforce the prevailing general guidance on inputs to modeling the emissions from mobile sources. That is, whenever possible, local data should be used to derive soak distribution inputs to the emissions models.

In this paper we present some beginnings in this direction. Specifically, we describe the incorporation of the recently developed Dynamic Traffic Assignment model (Janson, 1991a) within a regional evacuation modeling procedure. Termed DYMOD (DYnamic MODel), the procedure employs a mathematical programming approach to allocate evacuees to destinations and routes on the basis of regularly updated traffic loading rates, and to dynamically allocate these evacuating vehicle volumes by updating traffic stream interactions on the network. These traffic streams may be simulated to conform to either a user specified evacuation plan, or to a dynamically updated traffic equilibrium pattern simulated to produce the least clearance time for the system as a whole. We report on progress and discuss extension of DYMOD into the realm of real time evacuation monitoring, replanning and control. The major purpose of the paper is not to present a fully developed methodology, but rather to stimulate further research into an area much in need of study.",23

Implications of transient mode duration for spatially disaggregated high-resolution emission inventory studies,"Mohan Venigalla, Don Pickrell",1997,Journal Transportation research record,"High resolution emission inventory studies, such as urban air-shed modeling, often use spatially disaggregated emission parameters in the form of link-specific emissions. A key input variable that influences operating mode mix on highway links is the transient mode duration (TMD) in which start-related emissions occur. The TMD variable also establishes the emission rates to be embedded in emission factor models. The basic emission rates built into the MOBILE model are based on a TMD of 505 seconds, which was based on the federal test procedure (FTP). For newer vehicles, it is indicated that the TMD is much less than 505 seconds.

Generic vehicle speed models based on traffic simulation: Development and application,"R Margiotta, H Cohen, G Elkins, A Rathi, M Venigalla",1994/12/15,Issue CONF-9501116-1,"This paper summarizes the findings of a research project to develop new methods of estimating speeds for inclusion in the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) Analytical Process. The paper focuses on the effects of traffic conditions excluding incidents (recurring congestion) on daily average ed and excess fuel consumption. A review of the literature revealed that many techniques have been used to predict speeds as a function of congestion but most fail to address the effects of queuing. However, the method of Dowling and Skabardonis avoids this limitation and was adapted to the research. The methodology used the FRESIM and NETSIM microscopic traffic simulation models to develop uncongested speed functions and as a calibration base for the congested flow functions. The chief contributions of the new speed models are the simplicity of application and their explicit accounting for the effects of queuing. Specific enhancements include: (1) the inclusion of a queue discharge rate for freeways; (2) use of newly defined uncongested flow speed functions; (3) use of generic temporal distributions that account for peak spreading; and (4) a final model form that allows incorporation of other factors that influence speed, such as grades and curves. The main limitation of the new speed models is the fact that they are based on simulation results and not on field observations. They also do not account for the effect of incidents on speed.

A quick-response discrete transit-share model for transit-oriented developments,"Mohan Venigalla, Arsalan Faghri",2015/7/1,Journal Journal of Public Transportation,"Various studies have highlighted an apparent lack of analyses associated with the modal choice characteristics of transit-oriented developments (TODs) and emphasized the need for quick response models for estimating transit share in TOD areas. In this paper, a methodology for developing transit-share model for TOD’s using travel activity data is presented. A transit-share model is formulated as an innovative combination of the direct generation, urban travel factor (UTF), and logit models. This model determines transit usage in TODs based on household auto ownership as the primary input and the transit system variables as secondary inputs. Validation of the model indicates a close agreement with observed data. Since the input requirements to the TOD transit-share model are minimal, this model structure is expected to be very useful for sketch analysis of many TOD project alternatives.",11

This paper examines bikeshare users’ sensitivity to changes in price by conducting an intercept survey of bikeshare users. Monadic price testing approach was used to design questions on the survey instrument for eliciting responses on sensitivity of Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) users to price changes in fare products. Ordered logit regression method was used to analyze the price sensitivity of the users. The results indicated that income levels and race have statistically significant influence on price sensitivity. High-income group users are less price sensitive than the users of low-income groups. White users are about 20% less price sensitive than other races for both casual users purchasing single-trips and annual members. The monadic design allowed the development of pivot-price elasticities (demand curves) that could be used in evaluating pricing policy changes and project the change in bikeshare ridership and revenue. The price elasticities revealed that females are about 30% and 10% more price sensitive than males for single-trip fare (STF) and annual membership, respectively. Also, sightseeing trips are 30% less price sensitive than work trips for STF purchasers. This study demonstrates that users purchasing STF (casual users) are about 40% more price sensitive than those who purchased annual membership (registered members).

Environmental Justice Implications of Personal Travel-Related Emissions Burden,"Mohan M Venigalla, Xi Zhou",2008,Source Transportation Research Board 87th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"Total travel by personal vehicles on a typical day for households with higher-income is more than the travel for households with lower-income households. Since emissions are directly proportional to total travel, it can be hypothesized that the higher-income groups pollute disproportionally higher than the low-income populations. On the other hand, high income households tend to use later model vehicles while the older vehicles are used for trips made by low-income households. While longer trips do contribute to more emissions burden, it is also well established that emissions from older vehicles are higher than late model vehicles. Therefore another hypothesis in terms of emissions contribution arises: the usage of late model vehicles by higher income groups has an off-setting effect on the disproportional share of transportation system usage. This paper explores the relationship between the household income and vehicle-generated emissions based on the data from the National Household Travel Survey and Atlanta Household Travel Survey. The normalized emissions by household indicate that the lower-income populations bear the relatively obvious disadvantage on the CO emissions. However, the normalized emissions by person show the equity for all three main pollutants among populations with various income levels.",4

There is limited data and analysis to ascertain the net shift in travel modes of TOD residents before and after relocating to a TOD environment. This research presents methodologies for developing mode choice models for TODs using the travel activity data. Using these methods, two discrete choice models in the 0.25-mile radius of Rosslyn-Ballston corridor transit stations in the Washington Metro area are developed and validated. First, a multinomial logit model is developed using logistic regression to show the modal split among transit, auto-driver, auto-passenger, walk, bike and other in the study area. The primary focus of this TOD mode-share model is on home-based work trips, which predominantly constitute the number of trips in the 24-hour travel activity data. Secondly, a transit-share model is formulated as an innovative combination of the direct generation, urban travel factor (UTF) and logit models. This TOD transit-share model is aimed at determining transit usage in TODs based on household auto ownership as the primary input and only the transit variables (travel time, average wait time and average walk time) as secondary inputs. Results indicate that transit patronage decreases with increase in the household vehicle ownership. Since the input requirements to the TOD transit-share model are minimal, this model structure is expected to be very useful for sketch analysis of many TOD project alternatives. The methodologies presented in this paper are applicable to TODs …",3

Performance metrics for visualizing interdependent regional traffic congestion using aggregated probe vehicle data,"Thomas M Brennan Jr, Ryan A Gurriell, A Bechtel, Mohan M Venigalla",2019/1,Journal Transportation Research Board 97th Annual Meeting,"Analysis of the performance of expansive road transportation networks requires copious quantities of pertinent data. Traditional data sources for roadway performance measures are traffic counts, spot-speed studies and travel-time studies, which provide very limited data in terms of temporal and spatial coverage. In contrast, anonymous probe vehicles are currently acquiring big data repositories that are rich in spatial and temporal coverage over the vast majority of the nation’s roadways. These big data repositories are increasingly being used in transportation analytics and in the development of key performance measures. For example, the Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) incorporates probe vehicle data in the annual publication of the Urban Mobility Report, which ranks urban congestion levels throughout the United States (1). Probe vehicle data has been used in national mobility reports (2, 3) and statewide mobility reports of interstates as well as pre-defined commuter corridors using different performance measures (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Recent research has used this type of data to develop quantified regional performance measures along with visually intuitive graphical representation of large data sets ( 11, 12). Probe data has also been used to evaluate the impact on the roadway network after a natural disaster (12, 13) Collective congestion performance measures on a regional level provide a means to determine the impact of planning, operation decision, and overall resiliency to better determine future decisions regarding construction, detours, and may provide insight as to how to focus capital improvement funds to better manage …",2
A methodology to derive land use specific auto-trip emission footprints from household travel survey data,"Mohan Venigalla, Shweta Dixit, S Pulugurtha",2018/12,"Journal Urban, Planning and Transport Research","Regional travel-demand forecasting models are complex and cumbersome to use.

Could Value-Based Pricing Improve Economic Sustainability of Bikeshare?,"Mohan Venigalla, Siddartha Rayaprolu, Thomas Brennan, Shruthi Kaviti",2020/12/31,Journal Journal of Modern Mobility Systems,"We scrutinize the reactions of casual users of bikesharing services to fare menu, product pricing, and promotion. We hypothesize that by introducing value-based pricing into the fare-option mix, revenues can be increased and therefore enhance the economic sustainability of the bikesharing system. We conducted a controlled experimental survey of 157 current and potential bikeshare users across six cities in the United States. The survey registered the respondents’ choice of fare options in two groups: one with a binary choice set (control group) and the other with an additional value-priced choice (experimental group). Evidence points to users’ perception of value in bikeshare fare options would contribute to variations in revenues for the same ridership levels. Revenue projections and statistical tests showed that the introduction of value-based pricing options could lead to significant revenue increases. Furthermore, how the fare options are presented to the user would have an impact on users’ reception to the value-based pricing options in the product mix. The study results could be useful for numerous bikeshare systems in re-examining their product mixes and how they are presented to the users on websites, mobile apps and kiosk locations.",1

The study presents a comprehensive review of literature and practices regarding loading zones at different US cities; collected commercial vehicle parking occupancy data through video-monitoring at 20 different buildings in the District of Columbia; conducted business surveys for evaluating loading demand at the curb and on-site berths; and analyzed video and survey data to derive dwell time data for commercial vehicle loading activity at curbs and onsite berths of the subject buildings. Video surveillance and post-surveillance analysis of the video footage offered a viable mechanism for obtaining data on loading and unloading activity at curbside and onsite berths. By deploying the video footage on a private YouTube channel, the study developed an innovative methodology to store, manage and encode loading-unloading activities. This less intrusive methodology saved a significant amount of time while providing accurate and verifiable data. The analysis of loading activity provided fairly consistent results for curbsides and on-site berths at all buildings for which video data were analyzed. Some of the generalized observations include the following:• Most of the curbside activity at 13 buildings lasted for dwell times of 10 minutes or less• The most frequent dwell time for loading activities was 2 minutes for all data collection sites• On weekdays, loading peaks occur between 9AM-2 PM with most common peak-hour being 9-10 AM• Wednesday through Friday are peak days of the week for loading; Sundays have the lowest loading",

Current emission models such as the MOBILE series forecast an approximate estimation of the effects of speed on emission levels with the use of standardized input variables. However, the models do not precisely take into account uncontrollable variables such as vehicular volume, weather, and driver behavior. Data collected in real-time traffic would more accurately represent the effects of speed on emissions. Attempts were made to establish a relationship between emissions and density of signals. Furthermore, emissions data were collected for arterial segments with different land-use types. Mainly due to the inadequate breadth and depth of data the effect of signal density and land-use type on vehicular emissions could not be established.",

Using this definition as the basis, this study developed and used a special technique to trace the elapsed time of vehicles from trip origins during the traffic assignment of zone to zone trips on a highway network and determine the proportions of transient and stabilized operating modes on every link of the network. The travel models of the Sacramento Urban Area were utilized to actually apply this technique and derive operating mode fractions for this urban area. The data from the National Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS) were utilized to distinguish between cold transient and hot transient modes. The operating mode fractions were stratified by both functional class of roadways and the location within the urban area. The time of day of travel also was used for further stratification. The results show wide variations in the operating mode fractions among the different categories of roadways, location, and time of day.",
Generic Vehicle Speed Models Based On Traffic Simulation: Development and Application (Revision# 1),"Richard Margiotta, Harry S Cohen, Gary Elkins, Ajay Rathi, Mohan Venigalla",1994/12/15,Issue CONF-9501116-1,"The findings of a research project to develop new methods of estimating speeds for inclusion in the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) Analytical Process are summarized. The paper focuses on the effects of traffic conditions excluding incidents (recurring congestion) on daily average speed and excess fuel consumption. A review of literature revealed that most techniques used to estimate speed as a function of congestion failed to address the effects of queuing. The methodology presented used the FRESIM and NETSIM microscopic traffic stimulation models to develop uncongested speed functions and as a calibration base for the congested flow functions. The chief contributions of the new speed models are the simplicity of application and their explicit accounting for the effects of queuing. Specific enhancements include:(1) the inclusion of a queue discharge rates for freeways;(2) use of newly defined uncongested flow speed functions;(3) use of generic temporal distributions that account for peak spreading; and (4) a final model form that allows incorporation of other factors that influence speed, such as grades and curves. The main limitation of the new speed models is the fact they are based on simulation results and not on field observations. It is recommended that these and all future speed models be validated against field data.

The goal was to develop guidelines to choose between alternative treatments in different situations with respect to land use, traffic volume, travel speed, etc. The primary focus of this research was on arterial highways in developing suburban areas, and two alternative treatments--nontraversable medians and two-way left-turn lanes (TWLTLs). Several mathematical models were examined, but were found to be not universally applicable. The following investigations were performed to gain additional information:(1) a survey of highway design engineers of different state departments of transportation to identify their experience and preference;(2) an analysis of accidents on Tennessee highways with TWLTLs and medians, respectively; and (3) an analysis of traffic delay on road segments with a TWLTL and a median, respectively, using the simulation model known as NETSIM.","The purpose of this study was to examine the existing state of the art with regard to the selection of a roadway cross-section for a suburban arterial road.

Software Utilities for Traffic Simulation Models,"Mohan M Venigalla, Ajay K Rathi",Microcomputers in Transportation,Pages 707-717,"Simulation models of traffic flow on highways are increasingly becoming the choice of many analysts and traffic engineers as analytical tools to test, evaluate and implement traffic control/management systems alternatives. Several computer models exist which simulate vehicular traffic on urban and rural road networks at various levels of detail. The TRAF (for integrated TRAFfic simulation} family of simulation programs, and the evacuation model, IDYNEV (for interactive DYNamic EVacuation model) are examples of these models. As would be expected, these models are data intensive. In this paper, the need for and development of software utilities for creating input to the simulation models and analyzing their output is discussed. The development of a Software Utility for Regional Evacuation (SURE) is discussed in detail. The pre-processor module of SURE substantially reduces the time required to create input files to IDYNEV and the post-processor module summarizes the simulated results from the usually huge/DYNEV output files. The model also illustrates the evacuation network graphically and highlights problem links and intersections at selected intervals. These development methods could easily be adopted to other simulation programs with similar input structure such as the TRAF modeling system.",

Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,"Shruthi Kaviti, Mohan M Venigalla","Pricing is one of the major factors that affects ridership and revenue of the bikeshare systems. This paper examines bikeshare users' sensitivity to changes in price and preferences on service by conducting an intercept survey at Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) stations. Monadic price testing approach was used to design survey questions and elicit responses on sensitivity of users to price changes in fare products. Ordered logit regression results indicated that higher household income groups and ‘White’users are less sensitive to price compared to other income groups and other races/ethnicities, respectively. An illustrative application of the demand curves is presented, which showed that low-income groups are more sensitive to price than the middle and high-income groups. White users were found to be approximately 20% less price sensitive than other races for both casual users purchasing single-trips and annual members. The price elasticities revealed that females are about 30% and 10% more price sensitive than males for single-trip fare (STF) and annual membership, respectively. Also, sightseeing trips are 30% less price sensitive than work trips for STF purchasers. An illustrative application of income-based elasticities indicated that reducing the STF to $1.50 from the current $2.00 per trip and annual membership to $73.00 (from $85 per year) were found to improve both ridership and revenue. It is expected that the contributions from this study would provide insights and guidance on evaluating future pricing policy changes at various bikeshare systems.","Scholar articles Transportation Research Interdisciplinary PerspectivesS Kaviti, MM VenigallaRelated articles ","Pricing is one of the major factors that affects ridership and revenue of the bikeshare systems.
