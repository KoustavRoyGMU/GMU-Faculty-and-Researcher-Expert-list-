Deepsense: A unified deep learning framework for time-series mobile sensing data processing,"Shuochao Yao, Shaohan Hu, Yiran Zhao, Aston Zhang, Tarek Abdelzaher",2017/4/3,Book Proceedings of the 26th international conference on world wide web,"Mobile sensing and computing applications usually require time-series inputs from sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. Some applications, such as tracking, can use sensed acceleration and rate of rotation to calculate displacement based on physical system models. Other applications, such as activity recognition, extract manually designed features from sensor inputs for classification. Such applications face two challenges. On one hand, on-device sensor measurements are noisy. For many mobile applications, it is hard to find a distribution that exactly describes the noise in practice. Unfortunately, calculating target quantities based on physical system and noise models is only as accurate as the noise assumptions. Similarly, in classification applications, although manually designed features have proven to be effective, it is not always straightforward to find the most robust features to …",555

Existing device free human activity recognition approaches and systems, though yielding reasonably good performance in certain cases, are faced with a major challenge. The wireless signals arriving at the receiving devices usually carry substantial information that is specific to the environment where the activities are recorded and the human subject who conducts the activities. Due to this reason, an activity recognition model that is trained on a specific subject in a specific environment typically does not work well when being applied to predict another subject's activities that are recorded in a …",334

A recently explored solution space lies in compressing (approximating or simplifying) deep neural networks in some manner before use on the device. We propose a new compression solution, called DeepIoT, that makes two key contributions in that space. First, unlike current solutions geared for compressing specific types of neural networks, DeepIoT presents a unified approach that compresses all commonly used deep learning structures for sensing applications, including fully-connected, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks, as well as their combinations.

Rather, extreme run-time nonlinearities exist over the network configuration space. Hence, we propose a novel framework, called FastDeepIoT, that uncovers the non-linear relation between neural network structure and execution time, then exploits that understanding to find network configurations that significantly improve the trade-off between execution time and accuracy on mobile and embedded devices.

In this paper, we propose a new view that deep GCNs can actually learn to anti-oversmooth during training. This work interprets a standard GCN architecture as layerwise integration of a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and graph regularization. We analyze and conclude that before training, the final representation of a deep GCN does over-smooth, however, it learns anti-oversmoothing during training. Based on the conclusion, the paper further designs a cheap but effective trick to improve GCN training. We verify our conclusions and evaluate the trick on three citation networks and further provide insights on neighborhood aggregation in GCNs.",55

Controlvae: Controllable variational autoencoder,"Huajie Shao, Shuochao Yao, Dachun Sun, Aston Zhang, Shengzhong Liu, Dongxin Liu, Jun Wang, Tarek Abdelzaher",2020/11/21,Conference International Conference on Machine Learning,"Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and their variants have been widely used in a variety of applications, such as dialog generation, image generation and disentangled representation learning. However, the existing VAE models may suffer from KL vanishing in language modeling and low reconstruction quality for disentangling. To address these issues, we propose a novel controllable variational autoencoder framework, ControlVAE, that combines a controller, inspired by automatic control theory, with the basic VAE to improve the performance of resulting generative models. Specifically, we design a new non-linear PI controller, a variant of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, to automatically tune the hyperparameter (weight) added in the VAE objective using the output KL-divergence as feedback during model training. The framework is evaluated using three applications; namely, language modeling, disentangled representation learning, and image generation. The results show that ControlVAE can achieve much better reconstruction quality than the competitive methods for the comparable disentanglement performance. For language modeling, it not only averts the KL-vanishing, but also improves the diversity of generated text. Finally, we also demonstrate that ControlVAE improves the reconstruction quality for image generation compared to the original VAE.",47
Recursive ground truth estimator for social data streams,"Shuochao Yao, Md Tanvir Amin, Lu Su, Shaohan Hu, Shen Li, Shiguang Wang, Yiran Zhao, Tarek Abdelzaher, Lance Kaplan, Charu Aggarwal, Aylin Yener",2016/4/11,Conference 2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN),"The paper develops a recursive state estimator for social network data streams that allows exploitation of social networks, such as Twitter, as sensor networks to reliably observe physical events. Recent literature suggested using social networks as sensor networks leveraging the fact that much of the information upload on the former constitutes acts of sensing.

Multiple truth finding systems were developed to solve this problem, generally geared towards batch analysis of offline datasets. This work complements the present batch approaches by developing an online recursive state estimator that recovers ground truth from streaming data.

Unveiling polarization in social networks: A matrix factorization approach,"Md Tanvir Al Amin, Charu Aggarwal, Shuochao Yao, Tarek Abdelzaher, Lance Kaplan",2017/5/1,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2017-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,"This paper presents unsupervised algorithms to uncover polarization in social networks (namely, Twitter) and identify polarized groups. The approach is language-agnostic and thus broadly applicable to global and multilingual media. In cases of conflict, dispute, or situations involving multiple parties with contrasting interests, opinions get divided into different camps. Previous manual inspection of tweets has shown that such situations produce distinguishable signatures on Twitter, as people take sides leading to clusters that preferentially propagate information confirming their individual cluster-specific bias. We propose a model for polarized social networks, and show that approaches based on factorizing the matrix of sources and their claims can automate the discovery of polarized clusters with no need for prior training or natural language processing. In turn, identifying such clusters offers insights into prevalent …",43

In the absence of such advice, the default driver behavior is usually to accelerate to (near) the maximum legally allowable speed, traffic conditions permitting. This behavior is suboptimal if the traffic light ahead will turn red just before the vehicle arrives at the intersection. GreenDrive uses collected real-time vehicle mobility data to predict exact signal timing a few tens of seconds ahead, which allows it to offer advice on speed that saves fuel by avoiding unnecessary acceleration that leads to arriving too soon and stopping at red lights.

First, one should be able to successfully compute the course of action within some appropriate time window, which we call the decision deadline. Second, at the time the course of action is computed, the data it is based on must be fresh (i.e., within some corresponding validity interval). We call it the freshness constraint.

To this end, we deeply explore the characteristics of correlated mobility and figure out the fundamental relationships between the network performance and the scheduling parameters. Based on that, we establish the overall upper bound of the capacity-delay tradeoff in all the subcases of correlated mobility.

We, on the other hand, target on sensor-class micro servers, which are originally intended for uses in wearable technologies, sensor networks, and Internet-of-Things. Although sensor-class micro servers have much less capacity, they are touted for minimal power consumption (< 1 Watt), which opens new possibilities of achieving higher energy efficiency in datacenter workloads. Our systematic evaluation of the Edison cluster and comparisons to conventional brawny clusters involve careful workload choosing and laborious parameter tuning, which ensures maximum server utilization and thus fair comparisons. Results show that the Edison cluster achieves up to 3.5× improvement on work-done-per-joule for web service applications and data-intensive MapReduce jobs.

We propose SHMM, a multi-modal spherical hidden Markov model for semantics-rich human mobility modeling. Under the hidden Markov assumption, SHMM models the generation process of a given trace by jointly considering the observed location, time, and text at each step of the trace. The distinguishing characteristic of SHMM is the text modeling part. We use fixed-size vector representations to encode the semantics of the text messages, and model the generation of the l2-normalized text embeddings on a unit sphere with the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Compared with other alternatives like multi-variate Gaussian, our choice of the vMF distribution not only incurs much fewer parameters, but also better leverages the discriminative power of text embeddings in a directional metric space. The parameter inference for the vMF distribution is non-trivial since it involves functional inversion of ratios of Bessel functions. We theoretically prove, for the first time, that: 1) the classical Expectation-Maximization algorithm is able to work with vMF distributions; and 2) while closed-form solutions are hard to be obtained for the M-step, Newton's method is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution with quadratic convergence rate. We have performed extensive experiments on both synthetic and real …",17
Codrive: Cooperative driving scheme for vehicles in urban signalized intersections,"Yiran Zhao, Shuochao Yao, Huajie Shao, Tarek Abdelzaher",2018/4/11,Conference 2018 ACM/IEEE 9th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS),"This paper presents the design and evaluation of CoDrive, a cooperative speed advice system aiming at vehicular fuel savings by reconciling speeds of different vehicles with the timing of signalized intersections. Existing systems for speed coordination and platoon management primarily focus on safety, stability, and security issues. In the authors' own prior work, speed optimizations are discussed for minimizing fuel consumption by exploiting signalized intersection timing. In this paper, we recognize that vehicles whose paths diverge after the next intersection have different fuel-optimal speeds. Since slower vehicles will block faster ones from meeting their optimal speed in heavy traffic or on single-lane roads, we develop an algorithm for speed re-negotiation that arrives at a compromise speed for all vehicles involved.

In general, priority inversion occurs in real-time systems when computations that are of lower priority are performed together with or ahead of those that are of higher priority. In current machine perception software, significant priority inversion occurs because  resource allocation  to the underlying neural network models does not differentiate between critical and less critical data within a scene.

Unguided social sensing refers to the act of leveraging naturally occurring observations on social media as “sensor measurements”, when the sources post at will and not in response to specific sensing campaigns or surveys. A key challenge in social sensing, in general, lies in estimating the veracity of reported observations, when the sources reporting these observations are of unknown reliability and their observations themselves cannot be readily verified.

The work complements present decision monitoring and support tools and falls in the larger framework of decision-driven resource management.

Such protocols can therefore anticipate and deliver precisely the right data, at the right level of quality, from the right sources, at the right time, to enable valid and timely decisions at minimum cost to the underlying network. This paper presents the decision model used and the protocol design philosophy, reviews the key recent results and describes a novel system, called Athena, that is the first to embody the aforementioned data delivery paradigm. Evaluation results are presented that compare the performance of decision-centric anticipatory information delivery to several baselines, demonstrating its various advantages in terms of decision timeliness, validity and network resources used.

We demonstrate that -VAE, with , can not only attain good disentanglement but also significantly improve reconstruction accuracy via dynamic control. The paper removes the inherent trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and disentanglement for -VAE. Existing methods, such as -VAE and FactorVAE, assign a large weight to the KL-divergence term in the objective function, leading to high reconstruction errors for the sake of better disentanglement. To mitigate this problem, a ControlVAE has recently been developed that dynamically tunes the KL-divergence weight in an attempt to control the trade-off to more a favorable point. However, ControlVAE fails to eliminate the conflict between the need for a large  (for disentanglement) and the need for a small . Instead, we propose DynamicVAE that maintains a different  at different stages of training, thereby decoupling disentanglement and reconstruction accuracy. In order to evolve the weight, , along a trajectory that enables such decoupling, DynamicVAE leverages a modified incremental PI (proportional-integral) controller, and employs a moving average as well as a hybrid annealing method to evolve the value of KL-divergence smoothly in a tightly controlled fashion.

On orthogonality constraints for transformers,"Aston Zhang, Alvin Chan, Yi Tay, Jie Fu, Shuohang Wang, Shuai Zhang, Huajie Shao, Shuochao Yao, Roy Ka-Wei Lee",2021,Journal Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing,"Orthogonality constraints encourage matrices to be orthogonal for numerical stability. These plug-and-play constraints, which can be conveniently incorporated into model training, have been studied for popular architectures in natural language processing, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. However, a dedicated study on such constraints for transformers has been absent. To fill this gap, this paper studies orthogonality constraints for transformers, showing the effectiveness with empirical evidence from ten machine translation tasks and two dialogue generation tasks. For example, on the large-scale WMT'16 En -> De benchmark, simply plugging-and-playing orthogonality constraints on the original transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) increases the BLEU from 28.4 to 29.6, coming close to the 29.7 BLEU achieved by the very competitive dynamic convolution (Wu et al., 2019).",4
Stardust: A deep learning serving system in IoT: Demo abstract,"Shuochao Yao, Tianshi Wang, Jinyang Li, Tarek Abdelzaher",2019/11/10,Book Proceedings of the 17th Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,"The deep neural network becomes an increasingly crucial component in recent intelligent applications. The excessive resource consumptions of state-of-the-art neural networks, however, remains a huge impediment towards their widespread deployment in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose an IoT-oriented deep learning serving system, Stardust, that accelerates the neural network inference to improve the quality of IoT services. Stardust integrates several joint contributions from both the system and AI perspectives, including system performance predictor, model compression, and compressive offloading. On one hand, the performance predictor profiles and predicts the runtime characteristics of neural network operations on a particular device with the targeted runtime environment, which enables a hardware and software oriented performance optimization during model compression and …",3
Unsupervised Fill-level Estimation for Smart Trash Removal Systems.,"Yiran Zhao, Shuochao Yao, Shen Li, Shaohan Hu, Huajie Shao, Tarek F Abdelzaher",2017/2/20,Conference EWSN,"In this demo, we show an unsupervised, non-intrusive fill level estimation system, called Smartbin, which can be easily installed on the outside surface of waste bins to measure their occupancy levels. Smartbin uses a cheap mini-motor that exploits the physical nature of vibration resonance by learning forced vibration characteristics of the bin at different fill-levels over a small number of garbage collection cycles. This learning process occurs in a completely automated fashion ultimately enabling accurate fill level estimation that can serve as a component of smart (eg, demand-based) trash removal services. A preliminary evaluation on six different waste bins demonstrates ability of the system to accurately measure empty, half-full, and full bin states. This physical system will be demonstrated to illustrate unsupervised learning and fill level estimation.",3
Impacts of social relationships and inhomogeneous node distribution on the network performance,"Kechen Zheng, Jinbei Zhang, Shuochao Yao, Weijie Wu, Xinbing Wang, Chunyi Peng",2016/4/28,Journal IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,"This paper studies the impacts of social relationships and inhomogeneous node distribution on wireless network performance. Motivated by the social characteristic that makes nodes more likely to communicate with nearby nodes, we present a model that captures the small-world property, power-law distribution, and multi-clustering topology of wireless networks. We compute the average traffic distance to derive the optimal per-node capacity, which is then analyzed from the social perspective. Based on the communication pattern, we introduce the quasi-strong ties and quasi-weak ties in order to discover how system parameters control the amount of network flows with different strengths of social relationships. Moreover, we propose an indicator of information propagation speed (IIPS), and show that there is a tradeoff between the IIPS and the per-node capacity of overall nodes.",3
Simulation evaluation of fuel-saving systems in the city of chicago,"Yiran Zhao, Shuochao Yao, Dongxin Liu, Huajie Shao, Shengzhong Liu, Tarek Abdelzaher",2019/7/29,Conference 2019 28th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),"This paper presents realistic traffic simulations in four representative regions in Chicago, using real map data and historical traffic statistics, to estimate the amount of fuel that can be saved by two types of systems, namely, a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system and an Eco-Routing system. In particular, two previous systems called GreenDrive and GreenRoute are selected to estimate how much fuel they can save in a year, assuming they enjoy the same popularity as Google Maps. Evaluating intelligent transportation systems in simulation has attracted significant research efforts as large scale real-world experiments are often too expensive to carry out. However, simulation-based evaluations pose serious questions on how real the simulated environments are.

Computational Modeling of Hierarchically Polarized Groups by Structured Matrix Factorization,"Dachun Sun, Chaoqi Yang, Jinyang Li, Ruijie Wang, Shuochao Yao, Huajie Shao, Dongxin Liu, Shengzhong Liu, Tianshi Wang, Tarek F Abdelzaher",2021,Journal Frontiers in big Data,"The paper extends earlier work on modeling hierarchically polarized groups on social media. An algorithm is described that (i) detects points of agreement and disagreement between groups, and (ii) divides them hierarchically to represent nested patterns of agreement and disagreement. For example, two opposing parties might disagree on core issues. Moreover, within a party, despite agreement on fundamentals, disagreement might occur on further details. We call such scenarios hierarchically polarized groups. An (enhanced) unsupervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm is described for computational modeling of hierarchically polarized groups. It is enhanced with a language model, and with a proof of orthogonality of factorized components. We evaluate it on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating ability to hierarchically decompose overlapping beliefs. In the case where polarization is flat, we compare it to prior art and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for polarization detection and stance separation. An ablation study further illustrates the value of individual components, including new enhancements.",1
Controllable Variational Autoencoder,"Huajie Shao, Shuochao Yao, Dachun Sun, Aston Zhang, Shengzhong Liu, Dongxin Liu, Jun Wang, Tarek Abdelzaher",2020/4/13,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.05988,"Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and their variants have been widely used in a variety of applications, such as dialog generation, image generation and disentangled representation learning. However, the existing VAE models have some limitations in different applications. For example, a VAE easily suffers from KL vanishing in language modeling and low reconstruction quality for disentangling. To address these issues, we propose a novel controllable variational autoencoder framework, ControlVAE, that combines a controller, inspired by automatic control theory, with the basic VAE to improve the performance of resulting generative models. Specifically, we design a new non-linear PI controller, a variant of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, to automatically tune the hyperparameter (weight) added in the VAE objective using the output KL-divergence as feedback during model training.

Disentangling overlapping beliefs by structured matrix factorization,"Chaoqi Yang, Jinyang Li, Ruijie Wang, Shuochao Yao, Huajie Shao, Dongxin Liu, Shengzhong Liu, Tianshi Wang, Tarek F Abdelzaher",2020/2/13,"Journal arXiv e-prints, pp. arXiv–2002","Much work on social media opinion polarization focuses on identifying separate or orthogonal beliefs from media traces, thereby missing points of agreement among different communities. This paper develops a new class of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms that allows identification of both agreement and disagreement points when beliefs of different communities partially overlap. Specifically, we propose a novel Belief Structured Matrix Factorization algorithm (BSMF) to identify partially overlapping beliefs in polarized public social media. BSMF is totally unsupervised and considers three types of information:(i) who posted which opinion,(ii) keyword-level message similarity, and (iii) empirically observed social dependency graphs (eg, retweet graphs), to improve belief separation. In the space of unsupervised belief separation algorithms, emphasis was mostly given to the problem of identifying disjoint (eg, conflicting) beliefs. The case when individuals with different beliefs agree on some subset of points was less explored. We observe that social beliefs overlap even in polarized scenarios. Our proposed unsupervised algorithm captures both the latent belief intersections and dissimilarities. We discuss properties of the algorithm and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets. The results show that our model outperforms all compared baselines by a great margin.",1
Semi-supervised Hypergraph Node Classification on Hypergraph Line Expansion,"Chaoqi Yang, Ruijie Wang, Shuochao Yao, Tarek Abdelzaher",2022/10/17,Book Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management,"Previous hypergraph expansions are solely carried out on either vertex level or hyperedge level, thereby missing the symmetric nature of data co-occurrence, and resulting in information loss. To address the problem, this paper treats vertices and hyperedges equally and proposes a new hypergraph expansion named the line expansion(LE) for hypergraphs learning. The new expansion bijectively induces a homogeneous structure from the hypergraph by modeling vertex-hyperedge pairs. Our proposal essentially reduces the hypergraph to a simple graph, which enables the existing graph learning algorithms to work seamlessly with the higher-order structure. We further prove that our line expansion is a unifying framework over various hypergraph expansions. We evaluate the proposed LE on five hypergraph datasets in terms of the hypergraph node classification task. The results show that our method could …",
Exploring Spherical Autoencoder for Spherical Video Content Processing,"Jin Zhou, Na Li, Yao Liu, Shuochao Yao, Songqing Chen",2022/10/10,Book Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Multimedia,"3D spherical content is increasingly presented in various applications (e.g., AR/MR/VR) for better users' immersiveness experience, yet today processing such spherical 3D content still mainly relies on the traditional 2D approaches after projection, leading to the distortion and/or loss of critical information. This study sets to explore methods to process spherical 3D content directly and more effectively. Using 360-degree videos as an example, we propose a novel approach called Spherical Autoencoder (SAE) for spherical video processing. Instead of projecting to a 2D space, SAE represents the 360-degree video content as a spherical object and employs encoding and decoding on the 360-degree video directly. Furthermore, to support the adoption of SAE on pervasive mobile devices that often have resource constraints, we further propose two optimizations on top of SAE.First, since the FoV (Field of View …",

A large number of social media simulators model information diffusion on online social networks. However, information cascades do not originate in vacuum. Rather, they often originate as a reaction to events external to the online medium. Thus, to predict activity on the social medium, one must investigate the relation between external stimuli and online social responses. The paper presents a simulation pipeline that features stimulus/response models describing how social systems react to external events of relevance to them. Two case studies are presented to test the fidelity of different models. One investigates online responses to events in the Venezuela election crisis.

Revisit oversmoothing in deep GCNs,"Chaoqi Yang, Ruijie Wang, Shuochao Yao, Shengzhong Liu, Tarek Abdelzaher",2020/3/30,Journal Journal of Environmental Sciences (China) English Ed,"Oversmoothing has been assumed to be the major cause of performance drop in deep graph convolutional networks (GCNs). In this paper, we propose a new view that deep GCNs can actually learn to anti-oversmooth during training. This work interprets a standard GCN architecture as layerwise integration of a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and graph regularization. We analyze and conclude that before training, the final representation of a deep GCN does over-smooth, however, it learns anti-oversmoothing during training. Based on the conclusion, the paper further designs a cheap but effective trick to improve GCN training. We verify our conclusions and evaluate the trick on three citation networks and further provide insights on neighborhood aggregation in GCNs.",

However, documentation about specialties may be lacking or inaccurately specified in a health care institution. Thus, we propose to leverage diagnosis histories to recognize medical specialties that exist in practice.

We aim to recognize de facto diagnosis specialties that are listed in the Health Care Provider Taxonomy Code Set (HPTCS) and discover those that are unlisted. First, to recognize the former, we use similarity and supervised learning models. Next, to discover de facto diagnosis specialties unlisted in the HPTCS, we introduce a general discovery‐evaluation framework.

These applications are brought about by a confluence of three global trends:(i) the proliferation of connected embedded devices,(ii) the growing need for intelligent sensing and control solutions to a broad set of problems, from home-automation to industrial control, and (iii) the promise of LAN-like speeds offered by the emerging 5G wireless infrastructure, breaking communication barriers and better supporting computational offloading. These directions will change the nature of cloud workloads, motivating new research challenges [1]. In this envisioned world, embedded devices (or “things"") will be capable of human-like interactions with their environment, including speech recognition, vision, and gesture understanding. These capabilities will bring about such features as verbal device control, user authentication, and gesture-based human machine communication. Control loops will be closed by separating simple reflex-like functions that ensure safety from more computationally-involved planning, reasoning, and learning functions that will improve performance over time and offer additional assurances. These goals will be accomplished by allowing offloading (the heavier) machine intelligence and optimization tasks, both on the sensing and control sides. Indeed, the disparity between the resourceconstrained nature of embedded IoT devices and the computational needs of the aforementioned interactions suggests that data processing will be increasingly offloaded to external servers.
