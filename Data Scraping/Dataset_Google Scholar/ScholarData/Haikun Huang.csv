Deep trail-following robotic guide dog in pedestrian environments for people who are blind and visually impaired-learning from virtual and real worlds,"Tzu-Kuan Chuang, Ni-Ching Lin, Jih-Shi Chen, Chen-Hao Hung, Yi-Wei Huang, Chunchih Teng, Haikun Huang, Lap-Fai Yu, Laura Giarré, Hsueh-Cheng Wang",2018/5/21,Conference 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),"Navigation in pedestrian environments is critical to enabling independent mobility for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) in their daily lives. White canes have been commonly used to obtain contact feedback for following walls, curbs, or man-made trails, whereas guide dogs can assist in avoiding physical contact with obstacles or other pedestrians. However, the infrastructures of tactile trails or guide dogs are expensive to maintain. Inspired by the autonomous lane following of self-driving cars, we wished to combine the capabilities of existing navigation solutions for BVI users. We proposed an autonomous, trail-following robotic guide dog that would be robust to variances of background textures, illuminations, and interclass trail variations.

Pose-guided level design,"Yongqi Zhang, Biao Xie, Haikun Huang, Elisa Ogawa, Tongjian You, Lap-Fai Yu",2019/5/2,Book Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"Player's physical experience is a critical factor to consider in designing motion-based games that are played through motion sensor gaming consoles or virtual reality devices. However, adjusting the physical challenge involved in a motion-based game is difficult and tedious, as it is typically done manually by level designers on a trial-and-error basis. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatically synthesizing levels for motion-based games that can achieve desired physical movement goals. By formulating the level design problem as a trans-dimensional optimization problem which is solved by a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we show that our approach can automatically synthesize a variety of game levels, each carrying the desired physical movement properties. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we synthesize game levels for two different types of motion-based …",36
Exercise intensity-driven level design,"Biao Xie, Yongqi Zhang, Haikun Huang, Elisa Ogawa, Tongjian You, Lap-Fai Yu",2018/1/17,Journal IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,"Games and experiences designed for virtual or augmented reality usually require the player to move physically to play. This poses substantial challenge for level designers because the player's physical experience in a level will need to be considered, otherwise the level may turn out to be too exhausting or not challenging enough. This paper presents a novel approach to optimize level designs by considering the physical challenge imposed upon the player in completing a level of motion-based games. A game level is represented as an assembly of chunks characterized by the exercise intensity levels they impose on players. We formulate game level synthesis as an optimization problem, where the chunks are assembled in a way to achieve an optimized level of intensity. To allow the synthesis of game levels of varying lengths, we solve the trans-dimensional optimization problem with a Reversible-jump Markov …",27

However, most research on the influence of prior night’s sleep and gait has been conducted on older adults and clinical populations. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify individuals who experience partial sleep deprivation and/or sleep extension the prior night using single task gait. Participants (n = 123, age 24.3 ± 4.0 years; 65% female) agreed to participate in this study. Self-reported sleep duration of the night prior to testing was collected. Gait data was collected with inertial sensors during a 2 min walk test. Group differences (<7 h and >9 h, poor sleepers; 7–9 h, good sleepers) in gait characteristics were assessed using machine learning and a post-hoc ANCOVA. Results indicated a correlation (r = 0.79) between gait parameters and prior night’s sleep. The most accurate machine learning model was a Random Forest Classifier using the top 9 features, which had a mean accuracy of 65.03%. Our findings suggest that good sleepers had more asymmetrical gait patterns and were better at maintaining gait speed than poor sleepers. Further research with larger subject sizes is needed to develop more accurate machine learning models to identify prior night’s sleep using single-task gait.",

However, previous studies using machine learning (ML) have only used gait to identify individuals who report feeling anxious. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify individuals who report feeling anxious at that time using a combination of gait and quiet balance ML. Using a cross-sectional design, participants (n = 88) completed the Profile of Mood Survey-Short Form (POMS-SF) to measure current feelings of anxiety and were then asked to complete a modified Clinical Test for Sensory Interaction in Balance (mCTSIB) and a two-minute walk around a 6 m track while wearing nine APDM mobility sensors. Results from our study finds that Random Forest classifiers had the highest median accuracy rate (75%) and the five top features for identifying anxious individuals were all gait parameters (turn angles, variance in neck, lumbar rotation, lumbar movement in the sagittal plane, and arm movement). Post-hoc analyses suggest that individuals who reported feeling anxious also walked using gait patterns most similar to older individuals who are fearful of falling. Additionally, we find that individuals who are anxious also had less postural stability when they had visual input; however, these individuals had less movement during postural sway when visual input was removed.",

PURPOSE: To use ML to identify prior night’s sleep in healthy young adults using single-task walking gait. METHODS: Participants (n= 126, age 24.3±4.0 yrs; 65% female) completed a survey on their prior night’s sleep and performed a 2-minute walk around a 6m track. Gait data were collected using inertial sensors. Participants were split into 2 groups (< 7hs or> 9hs: poor sleepers; 7-9hs: good sleepers) and gait characteristics were used to classify participants into each group using ML models via a 10-fold cross validation. A post-hoc ANCOVA was used to assess gait differences. RESULTS: Using Random Forest Classifiers (RFC), top 9 features were extracted. Classification results suggest a 0.79 correlation between gait parameters and prior night’s sleep. The RFC models had a 65.03% mean classification accuracy rate. Top 0.3% of the models had 100% classification accuracy rate. The top 9 features were primarily characteristics that measured variance between lower limb movements.

For each outcome, a repeated-measures ANCOVA adjusted for age, gender, and exercise intensity (ratings of perceived exertion, RPE) was used to examine the group–time interaction. Results: Twentynine participants (age, 77±7 yr) completed either the EG program (n= 15) or the TPE program (n= 14). Statistically significant group–time interactions were observed in Trail Making Test Part A (P< 0.05) and single-task gait speed, stride length, swing time percentage, and double support percentage (all P< 0.05), and marginal group differences were observed in Mini-Mental State Examination (P= 0.07), all favoring the EG program. There were no statistically significant group differences in dual-task gait measurements except for swing time percentage and double support percentage, favoring the EG program. Conclusions: An 8-wk EG program for older adults at risk for falls contributed to modest …",
"Safety, Enjoyment, And Physiological Responses Of Kinect-based Exergames In Older Adults At Risk For Falls: 410 Board# 251 May 30 11: 00 AM-12: 30 PM","Elisa F Ogawa, Haikun Huang, Lap-Fai Yu, Tongjian You",2018/5/1,Journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise,"METHODS: Community-dwelling older adults who reported current mobility difficulties or falling in the past year were included in the study. Participants played three newly developed exergames (Double Decision, Target Trackers, and Visual Sweeps, 5 minutes each) in random order. Heart rate (HR) was measured during each exergame, and blood pressure (BP), rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and rating of the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale were recorded immediately after each exergame. Student t-tests were used to examine the differences in variables at resting state and during/after exercise. Repeated measure analyses of variance were used to examine the differences in variables among the three exergames.",
