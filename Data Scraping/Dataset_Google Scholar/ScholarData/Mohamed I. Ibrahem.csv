Efficient Privacy-Preserving Electricity Theft Detection with Dynamic Billing and Load Monitoring for AMI Networks,"Mohamed I Ibrahem, Mahmoud Nabil, Mostafa M Fouda, Mohamed Mahmoud, Waleed Alasmary, Fawaz Alsolami",2020/9/25,Journal IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"In advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), smart meters (SMs) are installed at the consumer side to send fine-grained power consumption readings periodically to the system operator (SO) for load monitoring, energy management, and billing. However, fraudulent consumers launch electricity theft cyber attacks by reporting false readings to reduce their bills illegally. These attacks do not only cause financial losses but may also degrade the grid performance because the readings are used for grid management. To identify these attackers, the existing schemes employ machine-learning models using the consumers' fine-grained readings, which violates the consumers' privacy by revealing their lifestyle. In this article, we propose an efficient scheme that enables the SO to detect electricity theft, compute bills, and monitor load while preserving the consumers' privacy.

PMBFE: Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Monitoring and Billing Using Functional Encryption for AMI Networks,"Mohamed I. Ibrahem, Mahmoud M. Badr, Mostafa M. Fouda, Mohamed Mahmoud, Waleed Alasmary, Zubair Md.

In this paper, we address this concern by formally formulating the data aggregation privacy problem, and propose a uniquely crafted Privacy-Preserving Monitoring and Billing scheme using Functional Encryption, referred to as PMBFE. Our proposed PMBFE fulfills four key objectives: (i) data aggregation for billing, (ii) dynamic pricing flexibility, (iii) load monitoring with customers' privacy preservation; and (iv) analysis on how the adopted functional encryption is able to jointly perform data aggregation efficiently and guarantee privacy-preservation.

A new approach for server-based load balancing using software-defined networking,"Mohamed I Hamed, Basem M ElHalawany, Mostafa M Fouda, Adly S Tag Eldien",2017/12/5,Conference 2017 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS),The traditional load balancers suffer from inflexibility and difficulty to manage network flows and they are very expensive hardware dedicated devices. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) gives a promising solution for traditional load balancer limitations. SDN is a new paradigm which enables programmability and centralized control for the network which offers inexpensive and flexible solutions. This paper aims to develop a new load balancing approach using SDN. We propose a “Bandwidth-based” load balancing approach that distributes the network requests among multiple servers based on the servers' bandwidth consumption. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared with different load balancing schemes (Round-robin and Connections-based) under a mininet emulation and a Raspberry Pi-based implementation.

A novel approach for resource utilization and management in SDN,"Mohamed I Hamed, Basem M ElHalawany, Mostafa M Fouda, Adly S Tag Eldien",2017/12/27,Conference 2017 13th International Computer Engineering Conference (ICENCO),"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a recent technology that makes a breakthrough into the computer networking world.

Countering Presence Privacy Attack in Efficient AMI Networks Using Interactive Deep-Learning,"Mohamed I. Ibrahem, Mahmoud M. Badr, Mohamed Mahmoud, Mostafa M. Fouda, Waleed Alasmary",2021/11,"Conference 2021 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","Reporting fine-grained power consumption readings periodically in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) results in transmitting a massive amount of data by each smart meter (SM). To collect these readings efficiently, change and transmit (CAT) approach can be used. In CAT, the SM sends a consumption reading only when there is enough change in the consumption, which reduces the number of transmitted readings. However, using the CAT approach may trigger attackers to launch a presence-privacy attack (PPA) to infer sensitive information such as the absence of the house occupants by analyzing their SM’s transmission pattern. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scheme, called “STID”, for collecting the power consumption readings efficiently in AMI networks while preserving the consumers’ privacy by transmitting spoofing transmissions based on an interactive deep-learning defense model.

Data privacy preservation and security in smart metering systems,"Mohamed S Abdalzaher, Mostafa M Fouda, Mohamed I Ibrahem",2022/10/10,Source Energies,"Smart meters (SMs) can play a key role in monitoring vital aspects of different applications such as smart grids (SG), alternative currents (AC) optimal power flows, adversarial training, time series data, etc. Several practical privacy implementations of SM have been made in the literature, but more studies and testing may be able to further improve efficiency and lower implementation costs. The major objectives of cyberattacks are the loss of data privacy on SM-based SG/power grid (PG) networks and threatening human life. As a result, losing data privacy is very expensive and gradually hurts the national economy. Consequently, employing an efficient trust model against cyberattacks is strictly desired. This paper presents a research pivot for researchers who are interested in security and privacy and shade light on the importance of the SM. We highlight the involved SMs’ features in several applications. Afterward, we focus on the SMs’ vulnerabilities. Then, we consider eleven trust models employed for SM security, which are among the common methodologies utilized for attaining and preserving the data privacy of the data observed by the SMs. Following that, we propose a comparison of the existing solutions for SMs’ data privacy. In addition, valuable recommendations are introduced for the interested scholars, taking into consideration the vital effect of SM protection on disaster management, whether on the level of human lives or the infrastructure level.",12

Based on the data analysis, we propose a general multi-data-source deep hybrid learning-based detector to identify the false-reading attacks. Our detector is trained on net meter readings of all customers besides data from the trustworthy sources to enhance the detector performance by learning the correlations between them. The rationale here is that although an attacker can report false readings, he cannot manipulate the solar irradiance and temperature values because they are beyond his control. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the results indicate that our detector can identify the false-reading attacks with high detection rate and low false alarm.",6

The proposed scheme uses the concept of dummy locations to hide the real locations of the users, but on top of that, it selects the dummy locations based on the users that exist in these locations.

Load Forecasting Techniques and Their Applications in Smart Grids,"Hany Habbak, Mohamed Mahmoud, Khaled Metwally, Mostafa M Fouda, Mohamed I Ibrahem",2023/2/2,Source Energies,"The growing success of smart grids (SGs) is driving increased interest in load forecasting (LF) as accurate predictions of energy demand are crucial for ensuring the reliability, stability, and efficiency of SGs. LF techniques aid SGs in making decisions related to power operation and planning upgrades, and can help provide efficient and reliable power services at fair prices. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have also played a significant role in improving the precision of demand forecasting. It is important to evaluate different LF techniques to identify the most accurate and appropriate one for use in SGs. This paper conducts a systematic review of state-of-the-art forecasting techniques, including traditional techniques, clustering-based techniques, AI-based techniques, and time series-based techniques, and provides an analysis of their performance and results. The aim of this paper is to determine which LF technique is most suitable for specific applications in SGs.
