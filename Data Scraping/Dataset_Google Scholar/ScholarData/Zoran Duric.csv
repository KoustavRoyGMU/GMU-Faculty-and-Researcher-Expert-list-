Tracking groups of people,"Stephen J McKenna, Sumer Jabri, Zoran Duric, Azriel Rosenfeld, Harry Wechsler",2000/10/1,Journal Computer vision and image understanding,"A computer vision system for tracking multiple people in relatively unconstrained environments is described. Tracking is performed at three levels of abstraction: regions, people, and groups. A novel, adaptive background subtraction method that combines color and gradient information is used to cope with shadows and unreliable color cues. People are tracked through mutual occlusions as they form groups and separate from one another. Strong use is made of color information to disambiguate occlusion and to provide qualitative estimates of depth ordering and position during occlusion. Simple interactions with objects can also be detected. The system is tested using both indoor and outdoor sequences. It is robust and should provide a useful mechanism for bootstrapping and reinitialization of tracking using more specific but less robust human models.",1118
Information hiding: steganography and watermarking-attacks and countermeasures: steganography and watermarking: attacks and countermeasures,"Neil F Johnson, Zoran Duric, Sushil Jajodia",2001,Volume 1,"Information Hiding: Steganography and Watermarking-Attacks and Countermeasures deals with information hiding. With the proliferation of multimedia on the Internet, information hiding addresses two areas of concern: privacy of information from surveillance (steganography) and protection of intellectual property (digital watermarking). Steganography (literally, covered writing) explores methods to hide the existence of hidden messages. These methods include invisible ink, microdot, digital signature, covert channel, and spread spectrum communication. Digital watermarks represent a commercial application of steganography. Watermarks can be used to track the copyright and ownership of electronic media. In this volume, the authors focus on techniques for hiding information in digital media. They analyze the hiding techniques to uncover their limitations. These limitations are employed to devise attacks against hidden information. The goal of these attacks is to expose the existence of a secret message or render a digital watermark unusable. In assessing these attacks, countermeasures are developed to assist in protecting digital watermarking systems. Understanding the limitations of the current methods will lead us to build more robust methods that can survive various manipulation and attacks. The more information that is placed in the public's reach on the Internet, the more owners of such information need to protect themselves from theft and false representation. Systems to analyze techniques for uncovering hidden information and recover seemingly destroyed information will be useful to law enforcement authorities in computer forensics …",901
Detection and location of people in video images using adaptive fusion of color and edge information,"Sumer Jabri, Zoran Duric, Harry Wechsler, Azriel Rosenfeld",2000/9/3,Conference Proceedings 15th International Conference on Pattern Recognition. ICPR-2000,"A new method of finding people in video images is presented. The detection is based on a novel background modeling and subtraction approach which uses both color and edge information.

The latter is used to delineate a person's body by guiding contour collection to segment the person from the background. The method is tolerant to scene clutter, slow illumination changes, and camera noise, and runs in near real time on a standard platform.",412
Modified matrix encoding technique for minimal distortion steganography,"Younhee Kim, Zoran Duric, Dana Richards",2007,"Conference Information Hiding: 8th International Workshop, IH 2006, Alexandria, VA, USA, July 10-12, 2006.

Those distortions have been utilized by steganalysis algorithms to detect that the objects had been modified. It has been proposed that only coefficients whose modification does not introduce large distortions should be used for embedding. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for information hiding in the LSBs of JPEG coefficients. Our algorithm uses modified matrix encoding to choose the coefficients whose modifications introduce minimal embedding distortion. We derive the expected value of the embedding distortion as a function of the message length and the probability distribution of the JPEG quantization errors of cover images. Our experiments show close agreement between the theoretical prediction and the actual embedding distortion. Our algorithm can be …,265

A method of detecting and tracking irises and eyelids in video,"S Sirohey, Azriel Rosenfeld, Zoran Duric",2002/6/1,Journal Pattern recognition,"We locate the eye corners, eyelids, and irises in every frame of an image sequence, and analyze the movements of the irises and eyelids to determine changes in gaze direction and blinking, respectively.

The head-independent motions of the irises can be used to determine behaviors like saccades and smooth pursuit. Tracking the upper eyelid and using the distance between its apex and the center of the iris, we detect instances of eye closure during blinking. In experiments on two short image sequences, in one of which the subject was wearing glasses, we successfully located the irises in every frame in which the eyes were fully or partially open, and successfully located the eyelids 80% of the time.

Qualitative image based localization in indoors environments,"Jana Kosecka, Liang Zhou, Philip Barber, Zoran Duric",2003/6/18,"Conference 2003 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2003. Proceedings.","Man made indoor environments possess regularities, which can be efficiently exploited in automated model acquisition by means of visual sensing. In this context we propose an approach for inferring a topological model of an environment from images or the video stream captured by a mobile robot during exploration. The proposed model consists of a set of locations and neighborhood relationships between them. Initially each location in the model is represented by a collection of similar, temporally adjacent views, with the similarity defined according to a simple appearance based distance measure. The sparser representation is obtained in a subsequent learning stage by means of learning vector quantization (LVQ). The quality of the model is tested in the context of qualitative localization scheme by means of location recognition: given a new view, the most likely location where that view came from is determined.",149

Estimating the heading direction using normal flow,"Yiannis Aloimonos, Zoran Duric",1994/9,Journal International Journal of Computer Vision,"If an observer is moving rigidly with bounded rotation then normal flow measurements (i.e., the spatiotemporal derivatives of the image intensity function) give rise to a constraint on the oberver's translation. This novel constraint gives rise to a robust, qualitative solution to the problem of recovering the observer's heading direction, by providing an area where the Focus of Expansion lies. If the rotation of the observer is large then the solution area is large too, while small rotation causes the solution area to be small, thus giving rise to a robust solution. In the paper the relationship between the solution area and the rotation and translation vectors is studied and experimental results using synthetic and real calibrated image sequences are presented.

We show that the motion of an object, when combined with information about the object and its normal uses, provides us with strong constraints on possible functions that the object might be performing.",55
Using image flow to detect eye blinks in color videos,"Ric Heishman, Zoran Duric",2007/2/21,Conference 2007 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV'07),"Static computer vision techniques enable non-intrusive observation and analysis of biometrics such as eye blinks.

Shooting a smooth video with a shaky camera,"Zoran Duric, Azriel Rosenfeld",2003/3,Journal Machine Vision and Applications," Abstract. The image sequence in a video taken by a moving camera may suffer from irregular perturbations because of irregularities in the motion of the person or vehicle carrying the camera. We show how to use information in the image sequence to correct the effects of these irregularities so that the sequence is smoothed, i.e., is approximately the same as the sequence that would have been obtained if the motion of the camera had been smooth. Our method is based on the fact that the irregular motion is almost entirely rotational, and that the rotational image motion can be detected and corrected if a distant object, such as the horizon, is visible.",34
Information hiding: Steganography and steganalysis,"Zoran Duric, Michael Jacobs, Sushil Jajodia",2005/1/1,Source Handbook of statistics,"The goal of steganography is to insert a message into a carrier signal so that it cannot be detected by unintended recipients.

Using normal flow for detection and tracking of limbs in color images,"Zoran Duric, Fayin Li, Yan Sun, Harry Wechsler",2002/8/11,Conference 2002 International Conference on Pattern Recognition,"Humans are articulated objects composed of non-rigid parts. We are interested in detecting and tracking human motions over various periods of time. We describe a method of detecting and tracking human body parts in color video sequences. The dominant motion region is detected using normal flow; expectation maximization, uniform sampling, and a shortest path algorithm are used to find the bounding contour for the moving arm. An affine motion model is fit to the arm region; residual analysis and outlier rejection are used for robust parameter estimation. The estimated parameters are used for the prediction of the location of the moving limb in the next frame. Detection and tracking results are combined to account for the deviations from the affine flow model and increase the robustness of the method. We demonstrate our method on several long image sequences corresponding to different limb movements.",27

In this paper we analyze the applicability of Green's theorem to ROA estimation. We derive a formula which relates three quantities: the average value of the ROA for a surface patch in the scene; a surface integral that depends on the surface slant of the patch; and the contour integral of the normal motion field around the image of the boundary of the patch. We analyze how much larger the ROA on the surface patch can be than the value of the contour integral, for given assumptions about the variability of the distance to points on the surface patch.

Thus, by randomly sampling corresponding shapes in the image pair we can generate a histogram of ratios of areas.

To assess these skills, a tangible computer readable medium initializes the programmable settings with a set of initial settings. It then presents a 3-D representation of a character or characters to a user. The user in turn is prompted to mimic the character (s) on a work space. While the user is attempting to mimic the character (s) using the end-effecter on the work space, timed stroke data are collected from the force-feedback haptic unit. Using the timed stroke data, an analysis is then generated to determine the user's precision and accuracy of mimicking the character.",9

Limited distortion in LSB steganography,"Younhee Kim, Zoran Duric, Dana Richards",2006/2/16,"Conference Security, Steganography, and Watermarking of Multimedia Contents VIII",It is well known that all information hiding methods that modify the least significant bits introduce distortions into the cover objects.

It has been proposed that only coefficients whose modification does not introduce large distortions should be used for embedding. In this paper we propose an effcient algorithm for information hiding in the LSBs of JPEG coefficients. Our algorithm uses parity coding to choose the coefficients whose modifications introduce minimal additional distortion. We derive the expected value of the additional distortion as a function of the message length and the probability distribution of the JPEG quantization errors of cover images.

Predicting image matching using affine distortion models,"Daniel Fleck, Zoran Duric",2011/6/20,Conference CVPR 2011,We propose a novel method for predicting whether an image taken from a given location will match an existing set of images. This problem appears prominently in image based localization and augmented reality applications where new images are matched to an existing set to determine location or add virtual information into a scene. Our process generates a spatial coverage map showing the confidence that images taken at specific locations will match an existing image set. A new way to measure distortion between images using affine models is introduced. The distortion measure is combined with existing machine learning and structure from motion techniques to create a matching confidence predictor. The predictor is used to generate the spatial coverage map and also compute which images in the original set are redundant and can be removed. Results are presented showing the predictor is more accurate …,

Proceedings, Part I 8","This paper presents a new model fitting approach to classify tentative feature matches as inliers or outliers during wide baseline image matching. The results show this approach increases the efficiency over traditional approaches (e.g. RANSAC) and other recently published approaches. During wide baseline image matching a feature matching algorithm generates a set of tentative matches. Our approach then classifies matches as inliers or outliers by determining if the matches are consistent with an affine model. In image pairs related by an affine transformation the ratios of areas of corresponding shapes is invariant. Our approach uses this invariant by sampling matches in a local region. Triangles are then formed from the matches and the ratios of areas of corresponding triangles are computed. If the resulting ratios of areas are consistent, then the sampled matches are classified as inliers. The resulting …",

Improved lower bounds on embedding distortion in information hiding,"Younhee Kim, Zoran Duric, Dana Richards",2008/3/18,"Conference Security, Forensics, Steganography, and Watermarking of Multimedia Contents X","The previous steganographic algorithm results in the modification of the image statistic, especially histogram of the coefficients. We propose a method to compensate for the histogram modification due to embedding. The new algorithm estimates the modification before the embedding process has started and modifies the histogram in advance so that the modification due to embedding is less noticeable. We have implemented our methods in Java and performed the extensive experiments with them. The experimental results have shown that our new method improves our previous steganographic algorithms by decreasing distortion and histogram modification.",

Detecting and Segmenting Motions by Matching Flows,"Yan Sun, Zoran Duric",2005/10/12,"Conference 2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",The motion of an articulated object can be very complex but the motions of its rigid parts are usually simple. Here a method is proposed to classify and segment the motion of an articulated object into simple motions in temporal and spatial domains. Simple motions are represented by the corresponding motion flow patterns. Both the motion detection and segmentation are accomplished by matching the flow patterns of known simple motions with image flow. Matching is done by comparing the parametric flows of motion patterns with the normal flows of a target image. The approach is demonstrated on several image sequences of moving arms,

SLT provides analytical generalization bounds suitable for practical model selection from small and noisy data sets of image measurements (normal flow). The method addresses the aperture problem by using the penalized risk (ridge regression). We demonstrate an application of this method on both synthetic and real image sequences and use it for motion interpolation and extrapolation.

Using these models we determine the head-independent motions of the irises and eyelids by stabilizing for the head motion. The head-independent motions of the irises are used to determine behaviors like saccades and smooth pursuit. Tracking the upper eyelid and using the distance between its apex and the center of the iris, we detect instances of eye closure during blinking.
