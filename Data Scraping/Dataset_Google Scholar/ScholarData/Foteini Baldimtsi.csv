Tumblebit: An untrusted bitcoin-compatible anonymous payment hub,"Ethan Heilman, Leen Alshenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro, Sharon Goldberg",2016,Journal Cryptology ePrint Archive,"This paper presents TumbleBit, a new unidirectional unlinkable payment hub that is fully compatible with today's Bitcoin protocol. TumbleBit allows parties to make fast, anonymous, off-blockchain payments through an untrusted intermediary called the Tumbler. TumbleBit's anonymity properties are similar to classic Chaumian eCash: no one, not even the Tumbler, can link a payment from its payer to its payee. Every payment made via TumbleBit is backed by bitcoins, and comes with a guarantee that Tumbler can neither violate anonymity, nor steal bitcoins, nor``print money''by issuing payments to itself. We prove the security of TumbleBit using the real/ideal world paradigm and the random oracle model. Security follows from the standard RSA assumption and ECDSA unforgeability. We implement TumbleBit, mix payments from 800 users and show that TumbleBit's off-blockchain payments can complete in seconds.",282

We present solutions to the anonymity problem for both transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain and off the blockchain (in so called micropayment channel networks).

Blind signatures and Bitcoin transaction contracts (aka smart contracts) ensure the anonymity and fairness during the bitcoin  voucher exchange. Our schemes are practical, secure and anonymous.",217
Anonymous Credentials Light.,"Foteini Baldimtsi, Anna Lysyanskaya",2013,Conference ACM-CCS,"We define and propose an efficient and provably secure construction of blind signatures with attributes. Prior notions of blind signatures did not yield themselves to the construction of anonymous credential systems, not even if we drop the unlinkability requirement of anonymous credentials. Our new notion in contrast is a convenient building block for anonymous credential systems. The construction we propose is efficient: it requires just a few exponentiations in a prime-order group in which the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Thus, for the first time, we give a provably secure construction of anonymous credentials that can work in the elliptic group setting without bilinear pairings and is based on the DDH assumption. In contrast, prior provably secure constructions were based on the RSA group or on groups with pairings, which made them prohibitively inefficient for mobile devices, RFIDs and smartcards …",179

Sorting is achieved via a novel protocol where the server is assisted by a secure coprocessor that is required to have only minimal computational and memory resources. The server and the coprocessor are assumed to be honest but curious, i.e., they honestly follow the protocol but are interested in learning more about the user data. We refer to the new protocol as private outsourced sorting since it guarantees that neither the server nor the coprocessor learn anything about user data as long as they are non-colluding. We formally define private outsourced sorting and present an efficient construction that is based on an encryption scheme with semi-homomorphic properties.",77

Pairing-Based Timed-Release Cryptography,"Konstantinos Chalkias, Foteini Baldimtsi, Dimitrios Hristu-Varsakelis, George Stephanides",2008,"Description Timed-Release Encryption (TRE) could be roughly dened as the encryption of condential data so that the resulting ciphertext cannot be decrypted by anyone, including the designated recipient(s), until a predetermined future time. TRE is useful, and oftentimes necessary, in a broad range of emerging applications (e.g. e-voting, e-auctions, e-contests, e-lottery) where a message transmitted in advance must remain secure for some time. Research on this topic has provided a wealth of theoretical developments and protocols, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The vast majority of the early attempts at TRE did not satisfy the desired security requirements. More recently, a number of innovative third-party based TRE schemes have emerged especially after the introduction of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE). For the most part, these are pairing-based schemes which use public key infrastructure and come with some form of provable security, scalability and user-anonymity. More specically, in a typical pairing-based TRE (PB-TRE) scheme the sender encrypts the message under a public key and a time information, so the knowledge of both the matching private key and a time-specic trapdoor (i.e. the secret information published by the time-server) are necessary for decryption. In such schemes, the sole role of a time-server is to periodically publish self-authenticated time-dependent trapdoors.

Moreover, due to the bilinearity property, modern schemes support TRE encryption …","Timed-Release Encryption (TRE) could be roughly dened as the encryption of condential data so that the resulting ciphertext cannot be decrypted by anyone, including the designated recipient(s), until a predetermined future time. TRE is useful, and oftentimes necessary, in a broad range of emerging applications (e.g. e-voting, e-auctions, e-contests, e-lottery) where a message transmitted in advance must remain secure for some time. Research on this topic has provided a wealth of theoretical developments and protocols, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The vast majority of the early attempts at TRE did not satisfy the desired security requirements. More recently, a number of innovative third-party based TRE schemes have emerged especially after the introduction of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE). For the most part, these are pairing-based schemes which use public key infrastructure and come with some form of provable security, scalability and user-anonymity.

"gOTzilla: Efficient Disjunctive Zero-Knowledge Proofs from MPC in the Head, with Application to Proofs of Assets in Cryptocurrencies","Foteini Baldimtsi, Panagiotis Chatzigiannis, S Dov Gordon, Phi Hung Le, Daniel McVicker",2022,Journal Cryptology ePrint Archive,"We present gOTzilla, a protocol for interactive zero-knowledge proofs for very large disjunctive statements of the following format: given publicly known circuit , and set of values , prove knowledge of a witness  such that . These type of statements are extremely important for the proof of assets (PoA) problem in cryptocurrencies where a prover wants to prove the knowledge of a secret key  that associates with the hash of a public key  posted on the ledger. We note that the size of  in popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, is estimated to 80 million. For the construction of gOTzilla, we start by observing that if we restructure the proof statement to an equivalent of proving knowledge of  such that , then we can reduce the disjunction of equalities to 1-out-of-N oblivious transfer (OT). Our overall protocol is based on the MPC in the head (MPCitH) paradigm. We additionally provide a concrete, efficient extension of our protocol for the case where  combines algebraic and non-algebraic statements (which is the case in the PoA application). We achieve an asymptotic communication cost of  plus the proof size of the underlying MPCitH protocol. While related work has similar asymptotic complexity, our approach results in concrete performance improvements. We implement our protocol and provide benchmarks. Concretely, for a set of size 1 million entries, the total run-time of our protocol is 14.89 seconds using 48 threads, with 6.18 MB total communication, which is about 4x faster compared to the state of the art when considering a disjunctive statement …",2

Using proprietary labeling data from the Blockchain Intelligence Group (BIG), we investigate the characteristics of a number of “malicious” Ethereum addresses. We first calculate the total number of transactions involving these addresses and the total amount of funds transferred through them, and then characterize smart contract addresses for ERC-20 tokens or DeFi applications, that the malicious addresses interact with. Finally, we apply machine learning techniques to identify additional “malicious” addresses by conducting a network clustering analysis within all Ethereum addresses from transactional relationships with the initial set of malicious addresses.",2

While Bitcoin currently works well in practice, there are many open questions regarding the long-term perspective of blockchain technologies, for both public and private/permissioned blockchains. It is yet unclear how processes can be designed to work in predictive ways and how to embed security in the lifecycle of smart contract development and deployment. Furthermore, the distributed nature of the system needs to be considered when thinking about which groups or individuals can influence future developments. Similar to'real-world'societies, blockchains are based on mutual recognition of conventions. Diverse academic disciplines as well as industry can and need to collaborate to advance research in blockchain and to fully understand how the technology might impact our future lives.",2
An Implementation Infrastructure for Server-Passive Timed-Release Cryptography,"Konstantinos Chalkias, Foteini Baldimtsi, Dimitrios Hristu-Varsakelis, George Stephanides",2008/9/8,Conference 2008 The Fourth International Conference on Information Assurance and Security,"As online transactions become increasingly practical, a broad range of industrial and e-government applications have emerged which depend on time-based protection of confidential data. Despite theoretical progress in timed-release cryptography (TRC), there is still no implementation infrastructure that takes advantage of the latest TRC algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to propose such an infrastructure for pairing-based timed-release cryptography (PB-TRC) systems. Our model uses key generation centers (KGCs) which publish decryption keys periodically, and satisfies the security requirements of modern third party-based TRC schemes. Our approach combines the best features of existing models into a generic and complete infrastructure which is to support TRC. It is also ""lighter"" in terms of complexity and communication, and is as effective (in terms of security and related properties) as the TRC protocol …",2

Truncator: Time-space Tradeoff of Cryptographic Primitives,"Foteini Baldimtsi, Konstantinos Chalkias, Panagiotis Chatzigiannis, Mahimna Kelkar",2022,Journal Cryptology ePrint Archive,"We're presenting mining-based techniques to reduce the size of various cryptographic outputs without loss of security. Our approach can be generalized for multiple primitives, such as key generation, signing, hashing and encryption schemes, by introducing a brute-forcing step to provers/senders aiming at compressing submitted cryptographic material. As a result, in systems that we can tolerate sender's work to be more demanding and time-consuming, we manage to optimize on verification, payload size and storage cost, especially when:-receivers have limited resources (ie mobile, IoT);-storage or data-size is financially expensive (ie blockchains, cloud storage and ingress cost);-multiple recipients perform verification/decryption/lookup (ie blockchains, TLS certs, IPFS lookups). Interestingly, mining can result in record-size cryptographic outputs, and we show that 5%-12% shorter hash digests and signatures are practically feasible even with commodity hardware. Obviously, the first thing that comes to mind is compressing addresses and transaction signatures in order to pay less gas fees in blockchain applications, but in fact even traditional TLS certificates and public keys, which are computed once and reused in every new connection, can be slightly compressed with this"" mining"" trick without compromising security. The effects of"" compressing once-then reuse''at mass scale can be economically profitable in the long run for both the Web2 and Web3 ecosystems.

Watermarking public‐key cryptographic functionalities and implementations: The case of encryption and signatures,"Foteini Baldimtsi, Aggelos Kiayias, Katerina Samari",2021/5,Journal IET Information Security,"A watermarking scheme for a public‐key cryptographic functionality enables the embedding of a mark in the instance of the secret‐key algorithm such that the functionality of the original scheme is maintained, while it is infeasible for an adversary to remove the mark (unremovability) or mark a fresh object without the marking key (unforgeability). A number of works have appeared in the literature proposing different definitional frameworks and schemes secure under a wide range of assumptions. In the previous work [1, 2], the authors proposed a meaningful relaxation of the watermarking model and gave constructions that allow direct watermarking of popular cryptographic schemes (e.g. ElGamal Encryption). A definitional framework for watermarking public‐key cryptographic functionalities and implementations which covers both deterministic (e.g. decryption) and probabilistic (e.g. signing) secret‐key algorithms is …",1

Watermarkable public key encryption with efficient extraction under standard assumptions,"Foteini Baldimtsi, Aggelos Kiayias, Katerina Samari",2022/9/5,"Book Security and Cryptography for Networks: 13th International Conference, SCN 2022, Amalfi (SA), Italy, September 12–14, 2022, Proceedings","The current state of the art in watermarked public-key encryption schemes under standard cryptographic assumptions suggests that extracting the embedded message requires either linear time in the number of marked keys or the a-priori knowledge of the marked key employed in the decoder. We present the first scheme that obviates these restrictions in the secret-key marking model, i.e., the setting where extraction is performed using a private extraction key. Our construction offers constant time extraction complexity with constant size keys and ciphertexts and is secure under standard assumptions, namely the Decisional Composite Residuosity Assumption [Eurocrypt’99] and the Decisional Diffie Hellman in prime order subgroups of square higher order residues.",
"(∈, δ)-Indistinguishable Mixing for Cryptocurrencies","Mingyu Liang, Ioanna Karantaidou, Foteini Baldimtsi, S Dov Gordon, Mayank Varia",2021/11,Journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,"We propose a new theoretical approach for building anonymous mixing mechanisms for cryptocurrencies. Rather than requiring a fully uniform permutation during mixing, we relax the requirement, insisting only that neighboring permutations are similarly likely. This is defined formally by borrowing from the definition of differential privacy. This relaxed privacy definition allows us to greatly reduce the amount of interaction and computation in the mixing protocol. Our construction achieves O ( n· polylog( n )) computation time for mixing n addresses, whereas all other mixing schemes require O ( n 2 ) total computation across all parties. Additionally, we support a smooth tolerance of fail-stop adversaries and do not require any trusted setup. We analyze the security of our generic protocol under the UC framework, and under a stand-alone, game-based definition. We finally describe an instantiation using ring signatures and confidential transactions.",

Efficient Cryptography for Information Privacy,Foteini Baldimtsi,2014,Institution Brown University,"In the modern digital society, individuals, businesses and governments perform numerous everyday tasks such as shopping, banking and commuting using electronic media. Although these electronic transactions provide efficiency and convenience, they usually overlook the privacy of the users. This thesis studies privacy-enhancing technologies in order to get the best of both worlds: all the benefits of electronic transactions but without sacrificing user privacy. Using efficient cryptographic tools such as digital signatures, zero-knowledge proof systems and encryption schemes, we propose secure protocols that protect user privacy and at the same time are practical. Anonymous credential systems allow users to obtain and demonstrate possession of digital credentials in order to authenticate themselves in a privacy-preserving manner.
