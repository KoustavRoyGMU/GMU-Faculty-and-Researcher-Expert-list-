Highlights from the era of open source web-based tools,"Kristin R Anderson, Julie A Harris, Lydia Ng, Pjotr Prins, Sara Memar, Bengt Ljungquist, Daniel Fürth, Robert W Williams, Giorgio A Ascoli, Dani Dumitriu",2021/2/3,Source Journal of Neuroscience,"High digital connectivity and a focus on reproducibility are contributing to an open science revolution in neuroscience. Repositories and platforms have emerged across the whole spectrum of subdisciplines, paving the way for a paradigm shift in the way we share, analyze, and reuse vast amounts of data collected across many laboratories. Here, we describe how open access web-based tools are changing the landscape and culture of neuroscience, highlighting six free resources that span subdisciplines from behavior to whole-brain mapping, circuits, neurons, and gene variants.",12
Discrepancies between cortical and behavioural long‐term readouts of hyperalgesia in awake freely moving rats,"B Ljungquist, T Jensen, L Etemadi, J Thelin, G Lind, M Garwicz, P Petersson, F Tsanakalis, J Schouenborg",2016/11,Journal European Journal of Pain,"It is still unclear to what extent the most common animal models of pain and analgesia, based on indirect measures such as nocifensive behaviours, provide valid measures of pain perception.",7
Large scale similarity search across digital reconstructions of neural morphology,"Bengt Ljungquist, Masood A Akram, Giorgio A Ascoli",2022/8/1,Journal Neuroscience Research,"Most functions of the nervous system depend on neuronal and glial morphology. Continuous advances in microscopic imaging and tracing software have provided an increasingly abundant availability of 3D reconstructions of arborizing dendrites, axons, and processes, allowing their detailed study. However, efficient, large-scale methods to rank neural morphologies by similarity to an archetype are still lacking. Using the NeuroMorpho.Org database, we present a similarity search software enabling fast morphological comparison of hundreds of thousands of neural reconstructions from any species, brain regions, cell types, and preparation protocols. We compared the performance of different morphological measurements: 1) summary morphometrics calculated by L-Measure, 2) persistence vectors, a vectorized descriptor of branching structure, 3) the combination of the two. In all cases, we also investigated the …",6
Efficient metadata mining of web-accessible neural morphologies,"Masood A Akram, Bengt Ljungquist, Giorgio A Ascoli",2022/1/1,Source Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,"Advancements in neuroscience research have led to steadily accelerating data production and sharing. The online community repository of neural reconstructions NeuroMorpho.Org grew from fewer than 1000 digitally traced neurons in 2006 to more than 140,000 cells today, including glia that now constitute 10.1% of the content. Every reconstruction consists of a detailed 3D representation of branch geometry and connectivity in a standardized format, from which a collection of morphometric features is extracted and stored. Moreover, each entry in the database is accompanied by rich metadata annotation describing the animal subject, anatomy, and experimental details. The rapid expansion of this resource in the past decade was accompanied by a parallel rise in the complexity of the available information, creating both opportunities and challenges for knowledge mining. Here, we introduce a new summary …",6
Investigation of requirements selection quality in market-driven software processes using an open source discrete event simulation framework,"Björn Regnell, Bengt Ljungquist, Thomas Thelin, Lena Karlsson",2004,"Journal Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Software Process Simulation and Modeling (ProSim), Stevenage, UK","When developing commercial software products it is crucial to select the right requirements for the right release and to have a short mean-time-to-market (MTTM) in order to be competitive. We report on a simulation of a model of market-driven requirements engineering processes with requirements selection quality as a key aspect. The simulator is built using an open source simulation framework and an evaluation of this framework is provided. The simulator enables investigation of how MTTM is affected by variations of internal and external process parameters. The results indicate that it is beneficial to put resources on a requirements screening phase, as this reduces the risk of process overload.",5
A bit-encoding based new data structure for time and memory efficient handling of spike times in an electrophysiological setup,"Bengt Ljungquist, Per Petersson, Anders J Johansson, Jens Schouenborg, Martin Garwicz",2018/4,Journal Neuroinformatics,"Recent neuroscientific and technical developments of brain machine interfaces have put increasing demands on neuroinformatic databases and data handling software, especially when managing data in real time from large numbers of neurons. Extrapolating these developments we here set out to construct a scalable software architecture that would enable near-future massive parallel recording, organization and analysis of neurophysiological data on a standard computer. To this end we combined, for the first time in the present context, bit-encoding of spike data with a specific communication format for real time transfer and storage of neuronal data, synchronized by a common time base across all unit sources. We demonstrate that our architecture can simultaneously handle data from more than one million neurons and provide, in real time (< 25 ms), feedback based on analysis of previously recorded …",4
"A novel framework for storage, analysis and integration through mediation of large-scale electrophysiological data","Bengt Ljungquist, Per Petersson, Jens Schouenborg, Anders J Johansson, Martin Garwicz",2011/4/27,Conference 2011 5th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering,"We present a framework based on object orientation with novel principles for how to store, analyze and integrate electrophysiological data. These principles are: (I) Using a Decorator pattern for storing analysis data in an object model, (II) using a Core Classes data structure for integration through mediation in a service bus architecture, and (III) choosing the single unit as the finest structure of the object model. With these principles, we address the problems of (1) how to relate the analysis data to the original electrophysiological data by utilizing design patterns, (2) how to integrate data from different data sources, both at application and organization levels and (3) avoiding performance problems by choosing the correct level of object granularity for the data.",3

Developing a Mobile Interface for NeuroMorpho. Org,"Matthew Kurapatti, Giorgio Ascoli Giorgio Ascoli, Praveen Menon, Navy Merianda, Bengt Ljungquist",2019/11/19,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"NeuroMorpho. Org is an online repository that provides more than 110,000 digital neuronal reconstructions and their associated metadata from more than 560 laboratories around the world. The diverse user base of this resource includes not only neuroscience professionals, such as researchers and educators but also other groups, such as artists and the general public. Previously, it has been difficult to connect from a mobile device due to the lack of a suitable interface. Through the development of a mobile application, we are better able to support usage by less technically versed users. However, it will also serve as a tool for researchers to quickly look up data while on the go or as a complementary interface to a standard computer in general. By utilizing React Native’s library and the Expo client to develop and test the application, we efficiently built an interface that is friendly to both Android and iOS users. In this …",

An IEC 62061 compliant safety system design method for machinery,"Bengt Ljungquist, Thomas Thelin",2005,"Conference Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security: 24th International Conference, SAFECOMP 2005, Fredrikstad, Norway, September 28-30, 2005. Proceedings 24","The purpose of safety systems is to reduce dangers to human life or environment to acceptable levels. In order to aid companies in this when developing safety systems for functional safety of machinery, the standard IEC 62061 has recently been released. The standard proposes an outlined design method to follow requirements specification. However, companies that use the standard have to implement a design method on their own. This paper presents an implementation and enhancements to the design method in terms of using state machines and function block analysis documentation. The state machine connects the functional safety requirements with ordinary behaviour for equipment under control. The proposed method is evaluated in an industrial case and the main results from this indicate that the method works well, but needs tool support. Hence, the paper presents requirements for such a tool and …",
Bitcoding the brain,BENGT LJUNGQUIST,"As a result of the development in the field of Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI), a continuously increasing number of neurons in the awake brain may be recorded from simultaneously over long periods of time. This has led to major challenges in handling the amount of neuronal data from these recordings. In this thesis, we show how to address these challenges by enabling organization and integration of large amounts of data, for both direct analysis in real time and for storing for later analysis online. In paper I, we present a software architecture for organizing and integrating electrophysiological data by using an object model for the data together with a service oriented architecture for data integration. Paper II presents findings providing direct evidence that chronic recordings in primary somatosensory cortex in awake animals can offer a powerful, and much sought for, translational model of the perception of pain magnitude during hyperalgesia, superior to previously used behavioral models for evaluation of pain conditions. Principles from paper I are applied, in order to enable faster comparisons between groups of data. Paper III describes a computationally highly efficient novel data structure using bit encoding for action potentials from single neurons, together with a software architecture for handling sources of data in parallel, for example from different groups of electrodes. We show how this enables collecting and analyzing signals from millions of neurons and then possibly providing direct feedback to the recorded subject’s brain in real time.",Scholar articles Bitcoding the brainB LJUNGQUISTRelated articles All 2 versions ,"As a result of the development in the field of Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI), a continuously increasing number of neurons in the awake brain may be recorded from simultaneously over long periods of time.

Increased understanding of the relation between the requirements engineering process and software product quality by simulation,Bengt Ljungquist,"Software process simulation is research field which lately have received increasing attention. Empirical studies may be used to elicit a model that captures behaviour of the studied process according to measurement data. The model may then be run, simulating possible improvement scenarios of the studied software process and thus providing “what-if” analysis for these scenarios. In order to validate the model, metrics capturing the result of a software process improvement may be compared to what the model predicted. The gap between prediction and reality from this validation would lead to feedback on the model. If the model turns out to capture the internal dynamics of the process correctly, the model predictions may be trusted to a greater extent, having increased credibility.",Scholar articles Increased understanding of the relation between the requirements engineering process and software product quality by simulationB LjungquistRelated articles ,"Software process simulation is research field which lately have received increasing attention.
