Wavelet-based multiscale statistical process monitoring: A literature review,"Rajesh Ganesan, Tapas K Das, Vivekanand Venkataraman",2004/9/1,Source IIE transactions,"Data that represent complex and multivariate processes are well known to be multiscale due to the variety of changes that could occur in a process with different localizations in time and frequency. Examples of changes may include mean shift, spikes, drifts and variance shifts all of which could occur in a process at different times and at different frequencies. Acoustic emission signals arising from machining, images representing MRI scans and musical audio signals are some examples that contain these changes and are not suited for single scale analysis. The recent literature contains several wavelet-decomposition-based multiscale process monitoring approaches including many real life process monitoring applications. These approaches are shown to be effective in handling different data types and, in concept, are likely to perform better than existing single scale approaches. There also exists a vast literature on …",166
Accuracy of reinforcement learning algorithms for predicting aircraft taxi-out times: A case-study of Tampa Bay departures,"Poornima Balakrishna, Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry",2010/12/1,Journal Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,"Taxi-out delay is a significant portion of the block time of a flight. Uncertainty in taxi-out times reduces predictability of arrival times at the destination. This in turn results in inefficient use of airline resources such as aircraft, crew, and ground personnel. Taxi-out time prediction is also a first step in enabling schedule modifications that would help mitigate congestion and reduce emissions. The dynamically changing operation at the airport makes it difficult to accurately predict taxi-out time. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of taxi out time prediction using a nonparametric reinforcement learning (RL) based method, set in the probabilistic framework of stochastic dynamic programming. A case-study of Tampa International Airport (TPA) shows that on an average, with 93.7% probability, on any given day, our predicted mean taxi-out time for any given quarter, matches the actual mean taxi-out time for the same …",116

Recent literature contains some applications of wavelet-based methods in monitoring, such as tool-life monitoring, bearing defect monitoring, and monitoring of ultra-precision processes. This paper presents a novel application of a wavelet-based multiscale method in a nanomachining process [chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)] of wafer fabrication.

In this article, an effective vulnerability management strategy, called VULCON (VULnerability CONtrol), is developed and evaluated. The strategy is based on two fundamental performance metrics: (1) time-to-vulnerability remediation (TVR) and (2) total vulnerability exposure (TVE). VULCON takes as input real vulnerability scan reports, metadata about the discovered vulnerabilities, asset criticality, and personnel resources. VULCON uses a mixed-integer multiobjective optimization algorithm to prioritize vulnerabilities for patching, such that the above performance metrics are optimized subject to the given resource constraints. VULCON has been tested on multiple months of real scan data from a cyber-security operations center (CSOC). Results indicate an overall TVE reduction of 8.97% when VULCON optimizes a …",53
Optimal scheduling of cybersecurity analysts for minimizing risk,"Rajesh Ganesan, Sushil Jajodia, Hasan Cam",2017/2/24,Journal ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),"Cybersecurity threats are on the rise with evermore digitization of the information that many day-to-day systems depend upon. The demand for cybersecurity analysts outpaces supply, which calls for optimal management of the analyst resource. Therefore, a key component of the cybersecurity defense system is the optimal scheduling of its analysts. Sensor data is analyzed by automatic processing systems, and alerts are generated. A portion of these alerts is considered to be significant, which requires thorough examination by a cybersecurity analyst. Risk, in this article, is defined as the percentage of unanalyzed or not thoroughly analyzed alerts among the significant alerts by analysts.

Dynamic scheduling of cybersecurity analysts for minimizing risk using reinforcement learning,"Rajesh Ganesan, Sushil Jajodia, Ankit Shah, Hasan Cam",2016/7/25,Journal ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),"An important component of the cyber-defense mechanism is the adequate staffing levels of its cybersecurity analyst workforce and their optimal assignment to sensors for investigating the dynamic alert traffic. The ever-increasing cybersecurity threats faced by today’s digital systems require a strong cyber-defense mechanism that is both reactive in its response to mitigate the known risk and proactive in being prepared for handling the unknown risks. In order to be proactive for handling the unknown risks, the above workforce must be scheduled dynamically so the system is adaptive to meet the day-to-day stochastic demands on its workforce (both size and expertise mix). The stochastic demands on the workforce stem from the varying alert generation and their significance rate, which causes an uncertainty for the cybersecurity analyst scheduler that is attempting to schedule analysts for work and allocate sensors to …",48
Estimating taxi-out times with a reinforcement learning algorithm,"Poornima Balakrishna, Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry, Benjamin S Levy",2008/10/26,Conference 2008 IEEE/AIAA 27th Digital Avionics Systems Conference,"Flight delays have a significant impact on the nationpsilas economy.

Without an accurate taxi-out time prediction for departures, there is no way to effectively manage fuel consumption, emissions, or cost.

Airport taxi-out prediction using approximate dynamic programming: intelligence-based paradigm,"Poornima Balakrishna, Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry",2008/1,Journal Transportation research record,"Flight delay is one of the pressing problems that have far-reaching effects on society and the nation's economy. A primary cause of flight delay in the National Airspace System is high taxi-out times (time between gate push-back and wheels-off) at major airports. Accurate prediction of taxi-out time is needed to make downstream schedule adjustments and for better departure planning, which could mitigate delays, emissions, and congestion on the ground. However, accurate prediction of taxi-out time is difficult because of uncertainties associated with the dynamically changing airport operation. A novel stochastic approximation scheme based on reinforcement learning (RL) is presented for predicting taxi-out times in the presence of weather and other departure-related uncertainties.

Online end point detection in CMP using SPRT of wavelet decomposed sensor data,"Tapas K Das, Rajesh Ganesan, Arun K Sikder, Ashok Kumar",2005/8/8,Journal IEEE transactions on semiconductor manufacturing,"Efficient end point detection (EPD) in chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is critical to quality and productivity of the wafer fabrication process. The cost of over and under polishing, and the cost of ownership of many expensive metrology-based EPD methods have motivated the researchers to seek cost effective and efficient alternatives. This paper presents a novel method for EPD, which uses a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) on the wavelet decomposed coefficient of friction (CoF) data from the CMP process. The method is made suitable for online application by developing a moving block data processing strategy, which matches the rate of data acquisition.

Detecting stealthy botnets in a resource-constrained environment using reinforcement learning,"Sridhar Venkatesan, Massimiliano Albanese, Ankit Shah, Rajesh Ganesan, Sushil Jajodia",2017/10/30,Book Proceedings of the 2017 Workshop on Moving Target Defense,"Modern botnets can persist in networked systems for extended periods of time by operating in a stealthy manner. Despite the progress made in the area of botnet prevention, detection, and mitigation, stealthy botnets continue to pose a significant risk to enterprises. Furthermore, existing enterprise-scale solutions require significant resources to operate effectively, thus they are not practical. In order to address this important problem in a resource-constrained environment, we propose a reinforcement learning based approach to optimally and dynamically deploy a limited number of defensive mechanisms, namely honeypots and network-based detectors, within the target network. The ultimate goal of the proposed approach is to reduce the lifetime of stealthy botnets by maximizing the number of bots identified and taken down through a sequential decision-making process.

However, there are a number of disruptive factors that can adversely impact the normal operating conditions such as (1) higher alert generation rates from a few IDSs, (2) new alert patterns that decreases the throughput of the alert analysis process, and (3) analyst absenteeism. The impact of all the above factors is that the alerts wait for a long duration before being analyzed, which impacts the readiness of the CSOC.

Improving quality of prediction in highly dynamic environments using approximate dynamic programming,"Rajesh Ganesan, Poornima Balakrishna, Lance Sherry",2010/11,Journal Quality and Reliability Engineering International,"In many applications, decision making under uncertainty often involves two steps—prediction of a certain quality parameter or indicator of the system under study and the subsequent use of the prediction in choosing actions. The prediction process is severely challenged by highly dynamic environments that particularly involve sequential decision making, such as air traffic control at airports in which congestion prediction is critical for smooth departure operations. Taxi‐out time of a flight is an excellent indicator of surface congestion and is a quality parameter used in the assessment of airport delays.

One emerging solution is to place fake text documents in the repository of critical documents for deceiving and catching cyber attackers. We can generate fake text documents by obscuring the salient information in legit text documents. However, the obscuring process can result in linguistic inconsistencies, such as broken co-references and illogical flow of ideas across the sentences, which can discern the fake document and render it unbelievable. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate believable fake text documents by automatically improving the linguistic consistency of computer-generated fake text. Our method focuses on enhancing syntactic cohesion and semantic coherence across discourse segments. We conduct experiments with human subjects to evaluate the effect of believability improvements in distinguishing legit texts from fake texts.

Adaptive reallocation of cybersecurity analysts to sensors for balancing risk between sensors,"Ankit Shah, Rajesh Ganesan, Sushil Jajodia, Hasan Cam",2018/6,Journal Service Oriented Computing and Applications,"Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC) is a service-oriented system.

Current practice at many CSOCs is to pre-assign analysts to sensors based on their expertise, and the alerts from the sensors are triaged, queued, and presented to analysts. Under adverse conditions, some sensors have more number of unanalyzed alerts (backlogs) than others, which results in a major security gap for the clients if left unattended.

This paper introduces a fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) model for determining convoy schedules and route clearance assignments in light of attack costs on a transportation network subject to IED ambushes. The model represents opponent interaction by assuming dependence between attack probabilities and targeted traffic patterns. There are currently few analytical approaches for this problem in the literature, but RL algorithms offer opportunities for meaningful improvements by optimizing individual movements across an extended planning horizon, accounting for downstream attacker-defender interaction.

A strategy for effective alert analysis at a cyber security operations center,"Rajesh Ganesan, Ankit Shah",2018,Journal From Database to Cyber Security: Essays Dedicated to Sushil Jajodia on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday,"Alert data management entails several tasks at a Cyber Security Operations Center such as tasks related to alert analysis, those related to threat mitigation if an alert is deemed to be significant, signature update for an intrusion detection system, and so on. This chapter presents a metric for measuring the performance of the CSOC, and develop a strategy for effective alert data management that optimizes the execution of certain tasks pertaining to alert analysis. One of the important performance metrics pertaining to alert analysis include the processing of the alerts in a timely manner to maintain a certain Level of Operational Effectiveness (LOE). Maintaining LOE requires two foremost tasks among several others: (1) the dynamic optimal scheduling of CSOC analysts to respond to the uncertainty in the day-to-day demand for alert analysis, and (2) the dynamic optimal allocation of CSOC analyst resources to …",4

The demand for cybersecurity analysts outpaces supply, which calls for optimal management of the analyst resource. In this chapter, a new notion of cybersecurity risk is defined, which arises when alerts from intrusion detection systems remain unanalyzed at the end of a work-shift. The above risk poses a security threat to the organization, which in turn impacts the operational effectiveness of the cybersecurity operations center (CSOC). The chapter considers four primary analyst resource parameters that influence risk. For a given risk threshold, the parameters include (1) number of analysts in a work-shift, and in turn within the organization, (2) expertise mix of analysts in a work-shift to investigate a wide range of alerts, (3) optimal sensor to analyst allocation, and (4) optimal scheduling …",4

Disparities have been found in terms of race, socioeconomic status, insurance type, and the location of candidate’s residency. While these disparities tend to coexist, disparity associated with candidates’ locations or “geographical disparity” is the first and foremost discussed. Researchers worldwide have repeatedly confirmed that the likelihood of receiving a transplant as well as pre-and posttrans-plant mortality rates vary significantly from region to region [1–10]. Geographic disparity in transplant access is a persistent issue ever since organ allocation became a regulated process in 1984 under the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA). As the most important act in the history of the US transplantation, NOTA created the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)–a public–private network of regional organ allocation offices known as Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs)[1]. NOTA also authorized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to contract with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) as the only administrative entity to administer OPTN. At first, all organs were distributed within each OPO’s service area in order to limit cold ischemia time (CIT), the interval between organ retrieval, and the time of transplantation during which an organ is preserved in a cold-perfusion solution (ibid). Allocation of organs within each OPO was solely based on the length of time that each candidate had spent waiting for an organ since initial referral.

Two can play that game: An adversarial evaluation of a cyber-alert inspection system,"Ankit Shah, Arunesh Sinha, Rajesh Ganesan, Sushil Jajodia, Hasan Cam",2020/4/1,Journal ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),"Cyber-security is an important societal concern. Cyber-attacks have increased in numbers as well as in the extent of damage caused in every attack. Large organizations operate a Cyber Security Operation Center (CSOC), which forms the first line of cyber-defense. The inspection of cyber-alerts is a critical part of CSOC operations (defender or blue team). Recent work proposed a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for the defender’s decision-making to prevent the cyber-alert queue length from growing large and overwhelming the defender. In this article, we perform a red team (adversarial) evaluation of this approach.

An outsourcing model for alert analysis in a cybersecurity operations center,"Ankit Shah, Rajesh Ganesan, Sushil Jajodia, Hasan Cam",2020/1/9,Journal ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),"A typical Cybersecurity Operations Center (CSOC) is a service organization. It hires and trains analysts, whose task is to perform analysis of alerts that were generated while monitoring the client’s networks. Due to ever-increasing financial and infrastructure burden on a CSOC driven by the rapidly growing demand for security services, it would become prohibitively expensive to continually expand the size of a CSOC to meet the demands in the future. An alternative solution is to outsource the alert analysis process to on-demand analysts, to provide scalable CSOC service to its clients with features, such as (1) higher throughput, (2) higher quality, and (3) more economical service than the current in-house service.

Adaptive Control of Multistage Airport Departure Planning Process using Approximate Dynamic Programming,"Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry",2007/2/15,"Journal Washington DC: George Mason University, Working Paper","Many service enterprise systems such as the airport departure systems are typical multistage multivariable systems with non-linear complex interactions between stages. These systems function over a wide range of operating conditions and are subject to random disturbances, which further enhance the non-linear characteristics. Also, there are many uncertain factors which often makes it is difficult to describe the process dynamics with complete information and accurate physical and empirical models. Adaptive controllers based on the analytical and/or artificial intelligence techniques can provide improved dynamic performance of the multistage process by allowing the parameters of the controller to adjust as the operating conditions change, and are known to operate in model free environment. One such example of an adaptive controller, is the combination of analytical dynamic programming methods and artificial intelligence techniques to achieve superior control of operations and improved quality of finished products. This new branch of research has become known as Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) methods. This paper first presents a state-of-the-art review including the advantages and limitations of ADP methods. Next, it develops a novel multiresolution assisted reinforcement learning controller (MARLC) based on ADP principles, which is used in an agent-based control model for improving the performance quality of the multistage airport departure planning process.

Wavelet Based Multiscale Statistical Process Monitoring-A,"Rajesh Ganesan, Tapas K Das, Vivekanand Venkataraman",2004/4/22,"Description Data representing the complex and multivariate processes are well known to be multiscale due to the variety of changes that could occur in a process with different localizations in time and frequency. Examples of changes may include mean shift, spikes, drifts, and variance shifts all of which could occur in a process at different times and at different frequencies. Acoustic emission signal arising from machining, images representing MRI scans, and musical audio signals are some examples that contain above changes and are not suited for single scale analysis. Recent literature contains several wavelet decomposition based multiscale process monitoring approaches including many real life process monitoring applications. These approaches are shown to be effective in handling different data types and, in concept, are likely to perform better than existing single scale approaches.

A Wavelet modulated Reinforcement Learning based Run-by-Run Controller,"Rajesh Ganesan, K Ramachandran, Tapas K Das",2003/11/21,"Description Run-by-Run (RbR) process control is a combination of Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Engineering Process Control (EPC). The set points of the automatic PID controllers, which control a process during a run, generally change from one run to the other to account for process disturbances like autocorrelation, deterministic trend, and shifts in the mean. RbR controllers perform the critical function of obtaining the set point for each new run. The design of a RbR control system primarily consists of two steps-process modeling, and online model tuning and control. Process modeling is done offline using techniques like response surface methods and ordinary least squares estimation. This paper deals with the second step, and presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based stochastic approximation strategy to RbR control of a stochastic process. The control problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP …","Run-by-Run (RbR) process control is a combination of Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Engineering Process Control (EPC).

Cochin-The Emerging Silicon Valley of India: Requirement of Right Policies,"V Anoop Kumar, R Ganesan","Software industry is acknowledged as an important engine of economic growth for many developing and under developed countries. Software development is a service that is both labour and knowledge-intensive. Nowhere are human resources as critically important as in the software sector. Human resources are not only the drivers and principal value-creators of the output of this industry; they are also the intellectual capital or the infrastructure investment. Therefore, attracting, training, retaining and motivating employees are the critical success-determinants of this industry.The comparative study and analysis of job satisfaction conducted at the two metros of Cochin and Bangalore reveals that the software professionals working at Cochin and its suburbs are not satisfied with their current job and its allied services. It shows that the satisfaction level of software professionals working at Bangalore is significantly high compared to Cochin, with respect to Nature of Job, Wages and Perks. The sub scales such as Pay, Fringe Benefits, Contingent Rewards, Operating Conditions and Communication also supported the same.","Scholar articles Cochin-The Emerging Silicon Valley of India: Requirement of Right PoliciesVA Kumar, R GanesanRelated articles ","Software industry is acknowledged as an important engine of economic growth for many developing and under developed countries.

Taxi-out Prediction using Approximate Dynamic Programming,"Rajesh Ganesan, Lance Sherry","High taxi-out times (time between gate push-back and wheels off) at major airports is a primary cause for flight delays in the National Airspace System (NAS). These delays have a cascading effect and affect the performance of Air Traffic Control (ATC) System. Accurate prediction of taxi-out time is needed to make downstream schedule adjustments and better departure planning, which mitigates delays, emissions, and congestions on the ground. However, the accurate prediction of taxi-out time is difficult due to the uncertainties associated with them. The primary objective of this paper is to accurately predict taxi-out time at major airports, in the presence of weather and other departure-related uncertainties. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based stochastic approximation scheme for predicting taxi-out times. The prediction problem is cast in a probabilistic framework of stochastic dynamic programming and solved using approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approaches. The strengths of the method is that is it non-parametric unlike the regression models with fixed parameters, highly adaptable to the dynamic airport environment since its learning based, is scalable, is inexpensive since it does not need highly sophisticated surface management system, and effectively handles uncertainties due to the probabilistic framework. The taxi-out prediction performance was tested on data obtained from the FAA’s Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) database on Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport (DTW), and Washington Reagan National (DCA) airports.
