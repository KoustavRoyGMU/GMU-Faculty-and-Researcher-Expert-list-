"Mechanical characterization of structurally porous biomaterials built via additive manufacturing: experiments, predictive models, and design maps for load-bearing bone …","D Melancon, ZS Bagheri, RB Johnston, L Liu, M Tanzer, D Pasini",2017/11/1,Journal Acta biomaterialia,"Porous biomaterials can be additively manufactured with micro-architecture tailored to satisfy the stringent mechano-biological requirements imposed by bone replacement implants. In a previous investigation, we introduced structurally porous biomaterials, featuring strength five times stronger than commercially available porous materials, and confirmed their bone ingrowth capability in an in vivo canine model. While encouraging, the manufactured biomaterials showed geometric mismatches between their internal porous architecture and that of its as-designed counterpart, as well as discrepancies between predicted and tested mechanical properties, issues not fully elucidated. In this work, we propose a systematic approach integrating computed tomography, mechanical testing, and statistical analysis of geometric imperfections to generate statistical based numerical models of high-strength additively …",179
Compensation strategy to reduce geometry and mechanics mismatches in porous biomaterials built with Selective Laser Melting,"Zahra S Bagheri, David Melancon, Lu Liu, R Burnett Johnston, Damiano Pasini",2017/6/1,Journal Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,"The accuracy of Additive Manufacturing processes in fabricating porous biomaterials is currently limited by their capacity to render pore morphology that precisely matches its design. In a porous biomaterial, a geometric mismatch can result in pore occlusion and strut thinning, drawbacks that can inherently compromise bone ingrowth and severely impact mechanical performance. This paper focuses on Selective Laser Melting of porous microarchitecture and proposes a compensation scheme that reduces the morphology mismatch between as-designed and as-manufactured geometry, in particular that of the pore. A spider web analog is introduced, built out of Ti–6Al–4V powder via SLM, and morphologically characterized. Results from error analysis of strut thickness are used to generate thickness compensation relations expressed as a function of the angle each strut formed with the build plane. The scheme is …",139
Biomechanical properties of an advanced new carbon/flax/epoxy composite material for bone plate applications,"Zahra S Bagheri, Ihab El Sawi, Emil H Schemitsch, Rad Zdero, Habiba Bougherara",2013/4/1,Journal Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,"This work is part of an ongoing program to develop a new carbon fiber/flax/epoxy (CF/flax/epoxy) hybrid composite material for use as an orthopaedic long bone fracture plate, instead of a metal plate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mechanical properties of this new novel composite material. The composite material had a “sandwich structure”, in which two thin sheets of CF/epoxy were attached to each outer surface of the flax/epoxy core, which resulted in a unique structure compared to other composite plates for bone plate applications. Mechanical properties were determined using tension, three-point bending, and Rockwell hardness tests. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the failure mechanism of specimens in tension and three-point bending tests. The results of mechanical tests revealed a considerably high ultimate strength in both tension (399.8 MPa) and …",86
Biomechanical analysis of a new carbon fiber/flax/epoxy bone fracture plate shows less stress shielding compared to a standard clinical metal plate,"Zahra S Bagheri, Pouria Tavakkoli Avval, Habiba Bougherara, Mina SR Aziz, Emil H Schemitsch, Radovan Zdero",2014/9/1,Journal Journal of biomechanical engineering,"Femur fracture at the tip of a total hip replacement (THR), commonly known as Vancouver B1 fracture, is mainly treated using rigid metallic bone plates which may result in “stress shielding” leading to bone resorption and implant loosening. To minimize stress shielding, a new carbon fiber (CF)/Flax/Epoxy composite plate has been developed and biomechanically compared to a standard clinical metal plate. For fatigue tests, experiments were done using six artificial femurs cyclically loaded through the femoral head in axial compression for four stages: Stage 1 (intact), stage 2 (after THR insertion), stage 3 (after plate fixation of a simulated Vancouver B1 femoral midshaft fracture gap), and stage 4 (after fracture gap healing). For fracture fixation, one group was fitted with the new CF/Flax/Epoxy plate (n = 3), whereas another group was repaired with a standard clinical metal plate (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) (n = 3). In …",67
Biomechanical fatigue analysis of an advanced new carbon fiber/flax/epoxy plate for bone fracture repair using conventional fatigue tests and thermography,"Zahra S Bagheri, Ihab El Sawi, Habiba Bougherara, Radovan Zdero",2014/7/1,Journal Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,"The current study is part of an ongoing research program to develop an advanced new carbon fiber/flax/epoxy (CF/flax/epoxy) hybrid composite with a “sandwich structure” as a substitute for metallic materials for orthopedic long bone fracture plate applications. The purpose of this study was to assess the fatigue properties of this composite, since cyclic loading is one of the main types of loads carried by a femur fracture plate during normal daily activities. Conventional fatigue testing, thermographic analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the damage progress that occurred during fatigue loading. Fatigue strength obtained using thermography analysis (51% of ultimate tensile strength) was confirmed using the conventional fatigue test (50–55% of ultimate tensile strength). The dynamic modulus (E⁎) was found to stay almost constant at 47 GPa versus the number of cycles, which can …",63

Biomechanical analysis using FEA and experiments of metal plate and bone strut repair of a femur midshaft segmental defect,"Jason Coquim, Joseph Clemenzi, Mohsen Salahi, Abdurahman Sherif, Pouria Tavakkoli Avval, Suraj Shah, Emil H Schemitsch, Z Shaghayegh Bagheri, Habiba Bougherara, Radovan Zdero",2018/10/18,Journal BioMed research international,"This investigation assessed the biomechanical performance of the metal plate and bone strut technique for fixing recalcitrant nonunions of femur midshaft segmental defects, which has not been systematically done before. A finite element (FE) model was developed and then validated by experiments with the femur in 15 deg of adduction at a subclinical hip force of 1 kN. Then, FE analysis was done with the femur in 15 deg of adduction at a hip force of 3 kN representing about 4 x body weight for a 75 kg person to examine clinically relevant cases, such as an intact femur plus 8 different combinations of a lateral metal plate of fixed length, a medial bone strut of varying length, and varying numbers and locations of screws to secure the plate and strut around a midshaft defect. Using the traditional “high stiffness” femur-implant construct criterion, the repair technique using both a lateral plate and a medial strut fixed with the maximum possible number of screws would be the most desirable since it had the highest stiffness (1948 N/mm); moreover, this produced a peak femur cortical Von Mises stress (92 MPa) which was below the ultimate tensile strength of cortical bone. Conversely, using the more modern “low stiffness” femur-implant construct criterion, the repair technique using only a lateral plate but no medial strut provided the lowest stiffness (606 N/mm), which could potentially permit more in-line interfragmentary motion (i.e., perpendicular to the fracture gap, but in the direction of the femur shaft long axis) to enhance callus formation for secondary-type fracture healing; however, this also generated a peak femur cortical Von Mises stress (171 MPa …",28

Our testing program has demonstrated that most safety footwear does not provide adequate slip-resistance and/or comfort in icy conditions. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine which of the most commonly worn safety footwear available to outdoor municipal workers in Toronto, Ontario, Canada would best prevent slips on icy surfaces and which models had good wearability. METHODS: We selected 45 of the most popular types of winter footwear worn by these workers and applied our Maximum Achievable Angle (MAA) test method to rate the slip-resistance of the footwear. A ten-point rating scale was used for recording participants’ perceptions of wearability. The MAA test measured the steepest ice-covered incline that participants can walk up and down without experiencing a slip.",13
The biomechanical effect of loading speed on Metal-on-UHMWPE contact mechanics,"Radovan Zdero, Zahra S Bagheri, Mojtaba Rezaey, Emil H Schemitsch, Habiba Bougherara",2014/5/16,Journal The open biomedical engineering journal,"Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a material commonly used in total hip and knee joint replacements. Numerous studies have assessed the effect of its viscoelastic properties on phenomena such as creep, stress relaxation, and tensile stress. However, these investigations either use the complex 3D geometries of total hip and knee replacements or UHMWPE test objects on their own. No studies have directly measured the effect of vertical load application speed on the contact mechanics of a metal sphere indenting UHMWPE. To this end, a metal ball was used to apply vertical force to a series of UHMWPE flat plate specimens over a wide range of loading speeds, namely, 1, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mm/min. Pressure sensitive Fujifilm was placed at the interface to measure contact area. Experimental results showed that maximum contact force ranged from 3596 to 4520 N and was logarithmically related (R 2= 0.96) to loading speed. Average contact area ranged from 76.5 to 79.9 mm 2 and was linearly related (R 2= 0.56) to loading speed. Average contact stress ranged from 45.1 to 58.2 MPa and was logarithmically related (R 2= 0.95) to loading speed. All UHMWPE specimens displayed a circular area of permanent surface damage, which did not disappear with time. This study has practical implications for understanding the contact mechanics of hip and knee replacements for a variety of activities of daily living.",13
Reducing fall risk for home care workers with slip resistant winter footwear,"Z Shaghayegh Bagheri, Jose Diaz Beltran, Paul Holyoke, Tilak Dutta",2021/1/1,Journal Applied ergonomics,"Falls on icy surfaces are the leading cause of occupational injuries for workers exposed to outdoor winter conditions. Slip resistant footwear has been shown to reduce the risk of falls for indoor workers but until recently, there was no accepted standard for evaluating the slip resistance of winter footwear on icy surfaces. Our team recently developed a lab-based testing protocol for measuring footwear slip resistance. This protocol, called the Maximum Achievable Angle (MAA) test, measures the steepest ice-covered slope that participants can walk up and down without experiencing a slip in a simulated winter environment. This lab-based protocol has found there is wide variability in the performance of commercially available winter footwear. In particular, we have found that a new generation of footwear that incorporates composite materials in the outsole, performs much better than most other footwear.",12

New flax/epoxy and CF/epoxy composite materials for bone fracture plate applications: a biological and wettability study,"ZS Bagheri, I Elsawi, A Amleh, EH Schemitsch, R Zdero, H Bougherara",2013,Journal ICCM,"Fixation of long bone fractures with clinicallyavailable metal plates may be limited because of a mismatch between the stiffness of the metal plate and the host cortical bone [1-3]. This mismatch can result in “stress shielding”, which leads to more load transfer to the plate instead of the bone, thereby resulting in bone resorption and eventual implant loosening [2, 3]. Thus, designing a fracture plate with mechanical properties close to cortical bone can reduce the negative effect of “stress shielding”. In this regard, composite materials have been suggested as an alternative to metals for manufacturing orthopaedic implants [4, 5]. These composites consist of a polymer matrix reinforced by synthetic fibers to achieve acceptable mechanical stiffness and strength [4-6]. However, their success depends on biocompatibility of both matrix and fibers [6].",4
Polymer-Based Materials Built with Additive Manufacturing Methods for Orthopedic Applications: A Review,"Kunal M Gide, S Islam, ZS Bagheri",2022/9/8,Journal Composite Science,"Over the last few decades, polymers and their composites have shown a lot of promises in providing more viable alternatives to surgical procedures that require scaffolds and implants. With the advancement in biomaterial technologies, it is possible to overcome the limitations of current methods, including auto-transplantation, xeno-transplantation, and the implantation of artificial mechanical organs used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. The risks associated with these methods include complications, secondary injuries, and limited sources of donors. Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has the potential to resolve some of these limitations. It can be used for the fabrication of tailored tissue-engineering scaffolds, and implants, repairing tissue defects in situ with cells, or even printing tissues and organs directly. In addition to perfectly matching the patient’s damaged tissue, printed biomaterials can have engineered microstructures and cellular arrangements to promote cell growth and differentiation. As a result, such biomaterials allow the desired tissue repair to be achieved, and could eventually alleviate the shortage of organ donors. As such, this paper provides an overview of different 3D-printed polymers and their composites for orthopedic applications reported in the literature since 2010. For the benefit of the readers, general information regarding the material, the type of manufacturing method, and the biomechanical tests are also reported.",3
Biomechanical analysis of fixation methods for acetabular fractures: a review,"Hannah Ferrante, Emil H Schemitsch, Radovan Zdero, Z Shaghayegh Bagheri",2021/3/1,Source Medical Engineering & Physics,"Acetabular fractures are known as one of the most frequent types of pelvic fractures with growing frequency among elderly people. Because of this, it is important to establish the methods of repair that will produce optimal outcomes for fracture healing and joint remobilization. Open reduction and internal fixation are considered as the “gold standard” of acetabular fracture repair; however, to the best of authors’ knowledge, there is no systematic review comparing different repair methods from biomechanical point of view. As such, in this review paper, we summarize the results of English language literature biomechanically focused on acetabular fracture fixation methods in the last thirty years with the aim to create a reference for clinical decision making.

Thermographic Stress Analysis of Whole Bones and Implants,"Zahra S Bagheri, Habiba Bougherara, Radovan Zdero",2017/1/1,Book Experimental Methods in Orthopaedic Biomechanics,"Experimental stress analysis of whole bones, implants, and whole bone–implant constructs is an important approach in orthopaedic biomechanics. High stresses in whole bones and implants may cause mechanical failure, but low stresses in whole bone may cause “stress shielding,” which leads to bone atrophy, bone resorption, and implant loosening. Surface strain gages are the “gold standard” tool for strain (and stress) analysis in this field, but strain gages are not fully reliable near high peak strains, provide only average strain at each location, cannot yield strain maps of the entire surface, are easily physically damaged, can permanently damage the surface during the mounting process, and have physical dimensions that limit where they can be mounted.

A 20-Year Review of Biomechanical Experimental Studies on Spine Implants Used for Percutaneous Surgical Repair of Vertebral Compression Fractures,"S Gajavelli, A Gee, ZS Bagheri, EH Schemitsch, CS Bailey, P Rasoulinejad, R Zdero",2022/9/21,Journal Biomed Research International,"A vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is an injury to a vertebra of the spine affecting the cortical walls and/or middle cancellous section. The most common risk factor for a VCF is osteoporosis, thus predisposing the elderly and postmenopausal women to this injury. Clinical consequences include loss of vertebral height, kyphotic deformity, altered stance, back pain, reduced mobility, reduced abdominal space, and reduced thoracic space, as well as early mortality. To restore vertebral mechanical stability, overall spine function, and patient quality of life, the original percutaneous surgical intervention has been vertebroplasty, whereby bone cement is injected into the affected vertebra. Because vertebroplasty cannot fully restore vertebral height, newer surgical techniques have been developed, such as kyphoplasty, stents, jacks, coils, and cubes. But, relatively few studies have experimentally assessed the biomechanical performance of these newer procedures. This article reviews over 20 years of scientific literature that has experimentally evaluated the biomechanics of percutaneous VCF repair methods. Specifically, this article describes the basic operating principles of the repair methods, the study protocols used to experimentally assess their biomechanical performance, and the actual biomechanical data measured, as well as giving a number of recommendations for future research directions.",

Compensation Strategy to Reduce Geometry and Mechanics Mismatches in Porous Biomaterials Built with Selective Laser Melting,"Damiano Pasini, Zahra S Bagheri, David Melancon, Lu Liu, R Burnett Johnston",2016,"Description The accuracy of Additive Manufacturing processes in fabricating porous biomaterials is currently limited by their capacity to render pore morphology that precisely matches its design. In a porous biomaterial, a geometric mismatch can result in pore occlusion and strut thinning, drawbacks that can inherently compromise bone ingrowth and severely impact mechanical performance. This paper focuses on Selective Laser Melting of porous microarchitecture and proposes a compensation scheme that reduces the morphology mismatch between as-designed and as-manufactured geometry, in particular that of the pore. A spider web analog is introduced, built out of Ti-6Al-4V powder via SLM, and morphologically characterized. Results from error analysis of strut thickness are used to generate thickness compensation relations expressed as a function of the angle each strut formed with the build plane. The scheme is applied to fabricate a set of three-dimensional porous biomaterials, which are morphologically and mechanically characterized via Micro Computed Tomography, mechanically tested and numerically analyzed. For strut thickness, the results show the largest mismatch (60% from the design) occurring for horizontal members, reduces to 3.1% upon application of the compensation. Similar improvement is observed also for the mechanical properties, a factor that further corroborates the merit of the design-oriented scheme here introduced.","The accuracy of Additive Manufacturing processes in fabricating porous biomaterials is currently limited by their capacity to render pore morphology that precisely matches its design.

The scheme is applied to fabricate a set of three-dimensional porous biomaterials, which are morphologically and mechanically characterized via Micro Computed Tomography, mechanically tested and numerically analyzed. For strut thickness, the results show the largest mismatch (60% from the design) occurring for horizontal members, reduces to 3.1% upon application of the compensation. Similar improvement is observed also for the mechanical properties, a factor that further corroborates the merit of the design-oriented scheme here introduced.",

On this page,"Sairam Gajavelli, Aaron Gee, Z Shaghayegh Bagheri, Emil H Schemitsch, Christopher S Bailey, Parham Rasoulinejad, Radovan Zdero","A vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is an injury to a vertebra of the spine affecting the cortical walls and/or middle cancellous section. The most common risk factor for a VCF is osteoporosis, thus predisposing the elderly and postmenopausal women to this injury. Clinical consequences include loss of vertebral height, kyphotic deformity, altered stance, back pain, reduced mobility, reduced abdominal space, and reduced thoracic space, as well as early mortality. To restore vertebral mechanical stability, overall spine function, and patient quality of life, the original percutaneous surgical intervention has been vertebroplasty, whereby bone cement is injected into the affected vertebra. Because vertebroplasty cannot fully restore vertebral height, newer surgical techniques have been developed, such as kyphoplasty, stents, jacks, coils, and cubes. But, relatively few studies have experimentally assessed the biomechanical performance of these newer procedures. This article reviews over 20 years of scientific literature that has experimentally evaluated the biomechanics of percutaneous VCF repair methods. Specifically, this article describes the basic operating principles of the repair methods, the study protocols used to experimentally assess their biomechanical performance, and the actual biomechanical data measured, as well as giving a number of recommendations for future research directions.","Scholar articles On this pageS Gajavelli, A Gee, ZS Bagheri, EH Schemitsch…Related articles ","A vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is an injury to a vertebra of the spine affecting the cortical walls and/or middle cancellous section.

Biomechanical Fatigue Analysis of a New Carbon Fiber/Flax/Epoxy Composite for Bone Fracture Plate Applications using Infrared Thermography,"ZS Bagheri, H Bougherara, I Elsawi, R Zdero","The biomechanical fatigue properties of a new Carbon fiber (CF)/Flax/Epoxy composite material for bone fracture plate application have been investigated in this study using both conventional fatigue tests and thermography analysis. The CF/Flax/Epoxy composite showed high cycle fatigue strength over a range of 200-220 MPa, which is much higher than clinical loads on the femur during normal daily activities. Moreover, the fatigue strength obtained with thermography analysis was in exact accordance with the range from the conventional fatigue tests with a value of 205 MPa. This study confirmed that the developed CF/Flax/Epoxy composite has desirable biomechanical fatigue properties for bone fracture plate application. In addition, this study introduced the application of thermography analysis to rapidly determine the fatigue strength of biomedical materials without the need of too many specimens.","Scholar articles Biomechanical Fatigue Analysis of a New Carbon Fiber/Flax/Epoxy Composite for Bone Fracture Plate Applications using Infrared ThermographyZS Bagheri, H Bougherara, I Elsawi, R ZderoRelated articles ","The biomechanical fatigue properties of a new Carbon fiber (CF)/Flax/Epoxy composite material for bone fracture plate application have been investigated in this study using both conventional fatigue tests and thermography analysis.
