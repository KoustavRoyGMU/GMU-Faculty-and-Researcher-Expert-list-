"Secure databases: Constraints, inference channels, and monitoring disclosures","Alexander Brodsky, Csilla Farkas, Sushil Jajodia",2000/11,Journal IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,"Investigates the problem of inference channels that occur when database constraints are combined with non-sensitive data to obtain sensitive information. We present an integrated security mechanism, called the Disclosure Monitor, which guarantees data confidentiality by extending the standard mandatory access control mechanism with a Disclosure Inference Engine. This generates all the information that can be disclosed to a user based on the user's past and present queries and the database and metadata constraints. The Disclosure Inference Engine operates in two modes: a data-dependent mode, when disclosure is established based on the actual data items, and a data-independent mode, when only queries are utilized to generate the disclosed information. The disclosure inference algorithms for both modes are characterized by the properties of soundness (i.e. everything that is generated by the …",217
Logical design for temporal databases with multiple granularities,"X Sean Wang, Claudio Bettini, Alexander Brodsky, Sushil Jajodia",1997/6/1,Journal ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),"The purpose of good database logical design is to eliminate data redundancy and isertion and deletion anomalies. In order to achieve this objective for temporal databases, the notions of temporal types, which formalize time granularities, and temporal functional dependencies (TFDs) are intrduced. A temporal type is a monotonic mapping from ticks of time (represented by positive integers) to time sets (represented by subsets of reals) and is used to capture various standard and user-defined calendars. A TFD is a proper extension of the traditional functional dependency and takes the form X  →μ Y, meaning that there is a unique value for Y during one tick of the temporal type μ for one particular X value. An axiomatization for TFDs is given. Because a finite set TFDs usually implies an infinite number of TFDs, we introduce the notion of and give an axiomatization for a finite closure to effectively capture a finite set of …",193

Information disclosure under realistic assumptions: Privacy versus optimality,"Lei Zhang, Sushil Jajodia, Alexander Brodsky",2007/10/28,"Conference 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, Proceedings of","The problem of information disclosure has attracted much interest from the research community in recent years. When disclosing information, the challenge is to provide as much information as possible (optimality) while guaranteeing a desired safety property for privacy (such as l-diversity). A typical disclosure algorithm uses a sequence of disclosure schemas to output generalizations in the nonincreasing order of data utility; the algorithm releases the first generalization that satisfies the safety property. In this paper, we assert that the desired safety property cannot always be guaranteed if an adversary has the knowledge of the underlying disclosure algorithm. We propose a model for the additional information disclosed by an algorithm based on the definition of deterministic disclosure function (DDF), and provide definitions of p-safe and p-optimal DDFs. We give an analysis for the complexity to compute a p …",91

Inference of monotonicity constraints in datalog programs,"Alexander Brodsky, Yehoshua Sagiv",1989/3/29,"Conference 8th ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS 1989) , Proceedings of the","Datalog (i.e., function-free logic) programs with monotonicity constraints on extensional predicates are considered. A monotonicity constraint states that one argument of a predicate is always less than another argument, according to some partial order. Relations of an extensional database are required to satisfy the monotonicity constraints imposed on their predicates. More specifically, a partial order is defined on the domain (i.e., set of constants) of the database, and every tuple of each relation satisfies the monotonicity constraints imposed on its predicate. An algorithm is given for inferring all monotonicity constraints that hold in relations of the intensional database from monotonicity constraints that hold in the extensional database.

System and method for adaptive trade specification and match-making optimization,"Alexander Brodsky, Alan Gozhansky, Sonya Karpishpan, Marcel Katz, Stanislav Zelivinski",2002,Patent office US,"Electronic commerce is facilitated through adaptive trade specifications and matchmaking optimization. Adaptive trade specifications provide a standard format for traders to specify what they want to obtain and what they are willing to give for it, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, as well as constraints and an objective such as maximum profit or minimum price. The standard format of the adaptive trade specifications allows the matchmaking optimization process to find the optimal match between traders. For example, if a buyer wishes to minimize the price of a desired purchase, subject to certain constraints, the standard format allows location of sellers meeting the constraints and performs one of various types of optimization to match the buyer with one or more sellers. Thus, one or more mutually agreeable transactions can be recommended.",51

The approach toward logic programming enunciated by systems such as NAIL![M* 86, M* 87] and LDL[NT88, Z88] puts the burden of showing termination and safety on the compiler.

Separability of polyhedra for optimal filtering of spatial and constraint data,"Alexander Brodsky, Catherine Lassez, Jean-Louis Lassez, Michael J Maher",1995/5/22,"Conference 14th ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS 1995), Proceedings of","The filtering method considered in this paper is based on approximation of a spatial object in d-dimensional space by the minimal convex polyhedron that encloses the object and whose facets are normal to preselected axes.

To address these limitations, this paper focuses on the development of the Unity analytics engine, which enables the construction of decision guidance systems from a repository of reusable analytic models that are expressed in JSONiq. Unity extends JSONiq with support for algebraic modeling using a symbolic computation-based technique and compiles reusable analytic models into lower-level, tool-specific representations for analysis.

"On Approximation-based Query Evaluation, Expensive Predicates and Constraints Objects","Alexander Brodsky, X. Sean Wang",1995/12,"Conference ILPS'95 workshop on Constraints, Databases and Logic Programming","The use of approximations of complex, possibly nested collection, objects can considerably improve the processing of queries with expensive predicates. The improvement is gained by (1) avoiding much of unnecessary evaluation of expensive predicates, and (2) enabling the use of a signi cantly wider range of special-purpose algorithms, and indexing techniques working on approximations of objects. This paper develops a necessary query transformation infrastructure for such approximationbased query processing, in presence of extensible family of collection types, aggregation functions, indices and special purpose algorithms. The approximation-based ltering is formalized by the notion of a ltering graph, whose arcs describe, intuitively, under which conditions a ltering predicate can be added before a predicate in a query. Next, two pre-processing mechanisms, the inverse grouping and approximation grouping are introduced to facilitate a direct retrieval of nested collection objects by testing their internal components, their transformations or approximations. Query transformation rules corresponding the ltering graph and the groupings are presented using a variation of monoid comprehension calculus. While the ltering graph and the groupings are powerful tools in optimization, the ltering graph must, in general, be provided the application programmer. However, this paper introduces and studies a very expressive family of constraint objects, for which the ltering graph and inverse and approximation groupings can be derived automatically. The paper also constructs complex query transformation templates which are derived from the basic …",17

An em-based ensemble learning algorithm on piecewise surface regression problem,"Juan Luo, Alexander Brodsky, Yuan Li",2012/8,Journal International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Statistics,"A multi-step Expectation-Maximization based (EM-based) algorithm is proposed to solve the piecewise surface regression problem which has typical applications in market segmentation research, identification of consumer behavior patterns, weather patterns in meteorological research, and so on. The multiple steps involved are local regression on each data point of the training data set and a small set of its closest neighbors, clustering on the feature vector space formed from the local regression, regression learning for each individual surface, and classification to determine the boundaries for each individual surface. An EM-based iteration process is introduced in the regression learning phase to improve the learning outcome. In this phase, ensemble learning plays an important role in the reassignment of the cluster index for each data point. The reassignment of cluster index is determined by the majority voting of predictive error of sub-models, the distance between the data point and regressed hyperplane, and the distance between the data point and centroid of each clustered surface. Classification is performed at the end to determine the boundaries for each individual surface. Clustering quality validity techniques are applied to the scenario in which the number of surfaces for the input domain is not known in advance.

A primary market for optimizing power peak-load demand limits,"Hesham Altaleb, Alexander Brodsky",2013/4/1,Journal International Journal of Decision Support System Technology (IJDSST),"In this paper the authors propose a market-based mechanism for organizational units of Commercial and Industrial power consumers or companies in a consortium to reduce their peak power demand. The market mechanism requires participants’ bids to indicate the value they associate with power needed to run various services, and the power quantity requirement for these services over a time horizon. The market resolution produces peak demand allocation, ie, determination of the peak demand and the associated cost that the units need to pay. The global peak-demand is then derived by optimizing individual participants’ peak demand. The market mechanism is based on decision optimization, and guarantees the formally defined properties of Pareto optimality, Nash equilibrium and benefit distribution fairness.",6
SC-CoJava: A Service Composition Language to Unify Simulation and Optimization of Supply Chains,"Alexander Brodsky, Malak Al-Nory, Hadon Nash",2012,"Book Springer Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, Modeling for Decision Support in Network-Based Services","The Service Composition (SC) CoJava language extends the programming language Java with (1) a modular service composition framework; (2) an extensible library of supply-chain modeling components such as items, services and business metrics; and (3) decision choice constructs for program variables, assertions of constraints and a designation of a program variable to serve as the objective to be minimized or maximized.

Piecewise Regression Learning in CoReJava Framework,"Juan Luo, Alexander Brodsky",2011/6,Journal International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing,"Java) is a framework which extends the programming language Java with built-in regression analysis, ie, the capability to do parameter estimation for a function. CoReJava is unique in that functional forms for regression analysis are expressed as first-class citizens, ie, as Java programs, in which some parameters are not a priori known, but need to be learned from training sets provided as input. Typical applications of CoReJava include calibration of parameters of computational processes, described as OO programs. If-then-else structures of Java language are naturally adopted to create piecewise functional forms of regression. Thus, minimization of the sum of least squared errors involves an optimization problem with a search space that is exponential to the size of learning set. In this paper, combinatorial restructuring algorithm is proposed to guarantee learning optimality and furthermore reduce the search space to be polynomial in the size of learning set, but exponential to the number of piece-wise bounds. Heaviside restructuring algorithm, which expresses the piecewise linear regression function using a unified functional format, instead of multiple pieces, is proposed to decrease the searching complexity further to be polynomial in both the size of learning set and the number of piece-wise bounds, while the learning outcome will be an approximation of the optimality.",6

Results of simulations are expected to provide reliable information for decision makers. But potential errors may be introduced during the M&S development lifecycle. It is critical to ensure to build the right model and the model is built right. M&S community has had intensive Verification and Validation (V&V) research. But V&V activities are often not formally performed in most of the cases. For those who perform V&V activities, they normally wait until development of the simulation modeling is finished. Practical and solid validation techniques are hence needed. In this paper, the authors propose a validation methodology that allows parallel simulation development and model parameter validation, ie first the simulation model can be built with unknown parameters included; and then, those parameters can be estimated using a built-in constraint optimizer. Finally the initially unknown parameters are replaced with the found optimal values. The model is then ready for future output prediction.

However, this paper uncovers an interesting relationship between these two properties when the generalization algorithms are publicly known. That is, preserving l-diversity in micro-data generalization can be done by preserving a new property, namely, l-cover, which is to satisfy l-anonymity in a special way. The practical impact of this discovery is that it may potentially lead to better heuristic generalization algorithms in terms of efficiency and data utility, that remain safe even when publicized.",6

Unity: a NoSQL-based platform for building decision guidance systems from reusable analytics models,"Mohamad Omar Nachawati, Alexander Brodsky, Juan Luo",2016,Publisher Technical Report GMU-CS-TR-2016-4. George Mason University,"Enterprises across all industries increasingly depend on decision guidance systems (DGSs) to facilitate decisionmaking across all lines of business. Despite significant technological advances, current DGS development paradigms lead to a tight-integration of the analytics models, methods and underlying tools that comprise these systems, often inhibiting extensibility, reusability and interoperability. To address these limitations, this paper focuses on the development of the first NoSQL decision guidance management system (NoSQL-DGMS), called Unity, which enables decision-makers to build DGSs from a repository of analytics models that can be automatically reused for different analytics methods, such as simulation, optimization and machine learning. In this paper, we provide the Unity NoSQL-DGMS reference architecture, and develop the first implementation, which is centered around a modular analytics engine that symbolically executes and automatically reduces analytics models, expressed in JSONiq, into lower-level, tool-specific representations. We conduct a preliminary experimental study on the overhead of OPL optimization models automatically generated from JSONiq using Unity, compared with manually-crafted OPL models. Preliminary results indicate that the execution time of OPL models that are automatically reduced from JSONiq is within a small constant factor of corresponding, manuallycrafted OPL models.",5
DG-Query: An XQuery-based Decision Guidance Query Language.,"Alexander Brodsky, Shane G Halder, Juan Luo",2014/4/27,Conference ICEIS (1),"Decision optimization is broadly used for making business decisions such as those for finding the best production planning in manufacturing. An optimization model may indicate the total cost of a certain supply chain given the various sourcing and transportation options used; the corresponding optimization problem can be to select among all possible sourcing and transportation options to minimize the total cost. Optimization modelling requires considerable mathematical expertise and effort to generate effective models. Additionally, the optimization process is heavily dependent on data. However, optimization languages such as IBM’s ILOG CPLEX OPL and Bell Laboratories’ AMPL, do not provide native support for manipulation of XML data. On the other hand, XQuery is a language for querying and manipulating XML data, which has become a ubiquitous standard (W3C) for data exchange between organizations; although, XQuery has no decision optimization functionality. To resolve this gap, this paper proposes DG-Query, an XQuery-based Analytics Language that seamlessly merges the XML data transformation and decision optimization capabilities. This is accomplished by first annotating existing XQuery expressions to precisely express the optimization semantics, and second to translate the annotated queries into an equivalent mathematical programming (MP) formulation that can be solved efficiently using existing optimization solvers. This paper presents DG-Query with an example, provides its formal semantics, and describes implementation through a reduction to MP formulation.",5

That members have the option to procure components from different co-members, each charging its individual price and posing its specific risk, raises challenging optimization problems related to the fulfillment of business objectives. This paper defines a transaction model for virtual enterprises, with formal concepts such as price, risk, and business objectives. The …",3
Online Optimization through Preprocessing for Multi-stage Production Decision Guidance Queries,"Nathan Egge, Alexander Brodsky, Igor Griva",2012/4/1,"Conference 28th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW 2012), Decision Guidance and Support Systems.","We consider optimization problems expressed in Decision Guidance Query Language that may involve linear arithmetic constraints, as well as finite domain and binary variables, and focus on a class of Multi-Stage Production problems in which only a part of the problem is dynamic, i.e., the demand for the output product in a manufacturing process, whereas the rest of the problem is static, i.e., the connectivity graph of the assembly processes and the cost functions of machines. We propose the online-decomposition algorithm (ODA) based on offline preprocessing that optimizes each static problem component for discretized values of shared constraint variables, and approximate the optimal aggregated utility functions. ODA uses the pre-processed approximated aggregated cost functions to decompose the original problem into smaller problems, and utilizes search heuristics for the combinatorial part of the problem …",3

Mixed-Integer Constrained Grey-Box Optimization based on Dynamic Surrogate Models and Approximated Interval Analysis,"Mohamad Omar Nachawati, Alexander Brodsky",2021/2/4,"Conference 10th International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems (ICORES-2021), Proceedings","In this paper an algorithmic framework, called GreyOpt, is proposed for the heuristic global optimization of simulations over general constrained mixed-integer sets, where simulations are expressed as a grey-box, ie computations using a mix of (1) closed-form analytical expressions, and (2) evaluations of numerical blackbox functions that may be non-differentiable and computationally expensive. GreyOpt leverages the partially analytical structure of such problems to dynamically construct differentiable surrogate problems for multiple regions of the search space. These surrogate problems are then used in conjunction with a derivative-based method to locally improve sample points in each region. GreyOpt extends Moore interval arithmetic for approximating the intervals of grey-box objective and constraint functions by fitting quadric surfaces that attempt to roughly underestimate and overestimate embedded black-box functions. This serves as the foundation of a recursive partitioning technique that GreyOpt uses to refine the best points found in each region. An experimental study of GreyOpt’s performance is conducted on a set of grey-box optimization problems derived from MINLPLib, where the ratio of black-box function evaluations to analytical expressions is small. The results of the study show that GreyOpt significantly outperforms three derivative-free optimization algorithms on these problems.",2

Constraint databases have recently emerged to deeply integrate data captured by constraints in databases. This paper reports on the development of the first constraint object-oriented database system, Cs, and describes its specification, de-sign and implementation. The C system is designed to be used for both implementation and optimization of high-level constraint object-oriented query languages such as Lyric or constraint extensions of OQL, and for directly building software systems requiring extensible use of constraint database features. The C data manipulation language, Constraint Com-prehension Calculus, is an integration constraint calculus for extensible constraint domains within monoid comprehensions, which serve as an optimization-level language for object-oriented queries.

The problem of optimal approximations of queries using views and its applications,"Alexander Brodsky, Amihai Motro",1995/5,Journal George Mason University Technical Report ISSETR95104,"In several recent works a common scenario is described: a relational database scheme R and a set of views V of this scheme are de ned, and queries on the database scheme R must be transformed to equivalent queries on the views V. Given a query Q on R, the rst problem is whether there exists a query QV expressed exclusively on V which is equivalent to Q, and, if it exists, how to nd it. Clearly, an equivalent QV may not always exist. In such a case, it is important to approximate Q as best as possible with a query on V. The problems here are to de ne approximations, to determine whether a best approximation exists, whether it is unique, and how to nd it. In this paper we formalize and answer these questions. Speci cally, we show that the following problems are decidable for a conjunctive query Q and a set of conjunctive views V:(1) is there a conjunctive query QV on V that is equivalent to Q, and (2) is there a union QU of conjunctive queries on V that is equivalent to Q? Furthermore, we show that QV and QU are e ectively computable if they exist. Moreover, the greatest lower bound of Q exists and is unique up to equivalence. This is done by introducing lower bound classi cations, and proving their existence, niteness and e ective computability.

Restoring compromised privacy in micro-data disclosure,"Lei Zhang, Alexander Brodsky, Sushil Jajodia",2010/4/13,"Conference 5th ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security, Proceedings of the","Studied in this paper is the problem of restoring compromised privacy for micro-data disclosure with multiple disclosed views. The property of γ-privacy is proposed, which requires that the probability of an individual to be associated with a sensitive value must be bounded by γ in a possible table which is randomly selected from a set of tables that would lead the same disclosed answers. For the restricted case of a single disclosed view, the γ-privacy is shown to be equivalent to recursive ([EQUATION], 2)-Diversity, which is not defined for multiple disclosed views. The problem of deciding on γ-privacy for a set of disclosed views is proven to be #P-complete.

A Three-Stage Cooperative Market Mechanism for Resilient Power Systems,"Alexander Brodsky, Roberto Levy",2022/5,Journal Springer Nature J. -  Computer Science,"The problem of power system resilience in the face of natural disasters and terrorist attacks has been studied from the systems engineering perspective, but more research is needed regarding preventive solutions against the collapse of power systems, which can ensure the most economically efficient operation of those systems, within the bounds of any remaining power capacity. Transferring power usage rights from the lowest-loss to the highest-loss entities would result in significant reduction of the combined loss. To address this need, we propose a three-stage cooperation market system of power allocation rights, which involves (1) a decision by each entity on bids and asks submitted to the market, (2) a market mechanism and resolution to determine bought and sold power allowances by the entities, and (3) given the market clearance, determination, by each entity, of its precise operational controls …",
Feature Selection with Hybrid Bio-inspired Approach for Classifying Multi-idiom Social Media Sentiment Analysis,"Luis Marcello Moraes Silva, Carlos Roberto Valencio, Geraldo Francisco Donega Zafalon, Angelo Cesar Columbini, J Filipe, M Smialek, A Brodsky, S Hammoudi",2022/1/1,Journal Iceis: Proceedings Of The 24th International Conference On Enterprise Information Systems-Vol 1,"Social media sentiment analysis consists on extracting information from users' comments. It can assist the decision-making process of companies, aid public health and security and even identify intentions and opinions about candidates in elections. However, such data come from an environment with big data characteristics, which can make traditional and manual analysis impracticable because of the high dimensionality. The implications on the analysis are high computational cost and low quality of results. Up to date research focuses on how to analyse feelings of users with machine learning and inspired by nature methods. To analyse such data effectively, a feature selection through cuckoo search and genetic algorithm is proposed. Machine learning with lexical analysis has become an attractive alternative to overcome this challenge. This paper aims to present a hybrid bio-inspired approach to realize feature selection and improve sentiment classification quality. The scientific contribution is the improvement of a classification model considering pre-processing of the data with different languages and contexts. The results prove that the developed method enriches the predictive model. There is an improvement of around 13% in accuracy with a 45% average usage of attributes related to traditional analysis.",

Toward Cloud Manufacturing: A Decision Guidance Framework for Markets of Virtual Things.,"Xu Han, Alexander Brodsky",2022,Conference 24th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS-2022),"In the value creation chain today, entrepreneurs have been faced with stiff hindrance in turning their innovative ideas into marketable products due to the manufacturing-entrepreneurship disconnect in terms of accessibility, predictability and agility. Toward bridging this gap, in this paper we develop a formal mathematical framework for markets of virtual things: parameterized products and services that can be searched, composed and optimized. The proposed framework formalizes the notions of virtual product and service designs and customer-facing specs as well as requirements’ specs. Based on these formal concepts, the framework also formalizes the notions of search for and composition of virtual products and services that (1) are mutually consistent with the requirement specs,(2) are Pareto-optimal in terms of customer-facing metrics such as cost, product desirable characteristics and delivery terms; and (3) that are optimal in terms of customer utility function that is expressed in terms of customer facing metrics. We also propose the design of a repository of virtual things and their artifacts, to be used in support of the virtual things’ markets. The proposed markets of virtual things can lead to democratizing innovation by allowing entrepreneurs without design and manufacturing expertise to bring their ideas to markets quickly.",

SPOT: Toward a Decision Guidance System for Unified Product and Service Network Design,"Joost Bottenbley, Alexander Brodsky",2021/4/26,"Conference 23rd International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS-2021), Proceedings","A major deficiency in the manufacturing ecosystem today is the lack of cloud-based infrastructure that supports the combined decision making and optimization of product design, process design, and supply chain, as opposed to hard wired solutions within silos today. The reported work makes a step toward bridging this deficiency by developing a software framework, prototype and a case study for SPOT-a decision guidance system for simultaneous optimization and trade-off analysis of combined service and product networks, capable to express the combined product, process and supply chain design. SPOT allows users to express, as data input, a hierarchical assembly and composition virtual products and services, ie, having fixed and control parameters that can be optimized. Virtual services produce a flow of virtual products, such as raw materials, parts of finished products. Like the virtual services, they are associated with analytic models that express customerfacing performance metrics and feasibility constraints, which are used for optimization. The uniqueness of our approach in SPOT is the use of modular simulation-like model for product and service networks, yet optimization quality and computational time of the best available mathematical programming solvers, which is achieved by symbolic computation of simulation code to generate lower-level mathematical programming models.",
A Hybrid Approach using Progressive and Genetic Algorithms for Improvements in Multiple Sequence Alignments.,"Geraldo Francisco Donegá Zafalon, Vitoria Zanon Gomes, Anderson Rici Amorim, Carlos Roberto Valêncio, J Filipe, M Smialek, A Brodsky, S Hammoudi",2021/1/1,Conference ICEIS (2),"The multiple sequence alignment is one of the main tasks in bioinformatics. It is used in different important biological analysis, such as function and structure prediction of unknown proteins. There are several approaches to perform multiple sequence alignment and the use of heuristics and meta-heuristics stands out because of the search ability of these methods, which generally leads to good results in a reasonable amount of time. The progressive alignment and genetic algorithm are among the most used heuristics and meta-heuristics to perform multiple sequence alignment. However, both methods have disadvantages, such as error propagation in the case of progressive alignment and local optima results in the case of genetics algorithm. Thus, this work proposes a new hybrid refinement phase using a progressive approach to locally realign the multiple sequence alignment produced by genetic algorithm based tools. Our results show that our method is able to improve the quality of the alignments of all families from BAliBase. Considering Q and TC quality measures from BaliBase, we have obtained the improvements of 55% for Q and 167% for TC. Then, with these results we can provide more biologically significant results.",

The proposed algorithm is based on (1) a series of deterministic approximations to produce a candidate set of near-optimal control settings for the production process, and (2) stochastic simulations on the candidate set using optimal simulation budget allocation methods. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on a use case of a real-world heat-sink production process that involves contract suppliers and manufacturers as well as unit manufacturing processes of shearing, milling, drilling, and machining, and conduct an experimental study that shows that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms four popular simulation-based stochastic optimization algorithms.",

Database constraints over both extensional and intensional databases form an (n+ k)-dimensional constraint object. A query answer over a data item x is an interval I of values along the x axis of the database such that I is correct (ie, the actual data value is within 1) and safe (ie, users cannot infer which point within I is the actual data value). The security requirements are expressed by the accuracy with which users are allowed to disclose data items. More specifically, we develop two classification methods:(1) volume-based classification, where the entire volume of the disclosed con-straint object that contains the data item is considered and (2) interval based classification, where the length of the interval that contains the data item is considered.

The Problem of Optimal Approximation of Queries,"Alexander Brodsky, Amihai Motro",1995/5,"Description In several recent works a common scenario is described: a relational database scheme R and a set of views V of this scheme are de ned, and queries on the database scheme R must be transformed to equivalent queries on the views V. Given a query Q on R, the rst problem is whether there exists a query QV expressed exclusively on V which is equivalent to Q, and, if it exists, how to nd it. Clearly, an equivalent QV may not always exist. In such a case, it is important to approximate Q as best as possible with a query on V. The problems here are to de ne approximations, to determine whether a best approximation exists, whether it is unique, and how to nd it. In this paper we formalize and answer these questions. Speci cally, we show that the following problems are decidable for a conjunctive query Q and a set of conjunctive views V:(1) is there a conjunctive query QV on V that is equivalent to Q, and (2) is there a …","In several recent works a common scenario is described: a relational database scheme R and a set of views V of this scheme are de ned, and queries on the database scheme R must be transformed to equivalent queries on the views V.

A cost-effective low-carbon framework to manage emissions from water desalination,"Malak Al-Nory, Mohammed Antar, Alexander Brodsky, Stephen Graves, Hussameldin Khonkar, John Lienhard, Khulood A Rambo","The commitment undertaken by G20 countries to lower their carbon emissions levels makes renewable energy-powered water desalination especially valuable, given that almost half the global water desalination capacity is installed in these countries. Recent installations have shown that Reverse Osmosis (RO) operated by Solar PV is extremely suitable for green desalination. G20 countries should adopt Photovoltaic Reverse Osmosis (PVRO) with water storage for cost-effective and low-carbon water desalination. They should include PVRO projects within the structured financing available for renewable energy projects. The G20 countries with the largest desalination and renewable energy capacities may sign a Cooperative Framework Agreement to establish a global cooperation platform.","Scholar articles A cost-effective low-carbon framework to manage emissions from water desalinationM Al-Nory, M Antar, A Brodsky, S Graves, H Khonkar…Related articles All 2 versions ","The commitment undertaken by G20 countries to lower their carbon emissions levels makes renewable energy-powered water desalination especially valuable, given that almost half the global water desalination capacity is installed in these countries.

Software Release Scheduling to Optimize Business Workflow Processes: Modeling and Decision Guidance,"Fernando Boccanera, Alexander Brodsky","Many software development projects fail because they do not deliver sufficient business benefit to justify the investment. Existing approaches to estimating business benefit of software development adopt unrealistic assumptions which produce imprecise results. This paper focuses on removing this limitation for software projects that automate business workflow processes. For this class of projects, the paper proposes a new approach and a decision-guidance framework to select and schedule software features over a sequence of software releases as to maximize the net present value of the combined cash flow of software development as well as the improved organizational business workflow. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is in precise modelling of the business workflow processes and the savings achieved by deploying new software functionality.","Scholar articles Software Release Scheduling to Optimize Business Workflow Processes: Modeling and Decision GuidanceF Boccanera, A BrodskyRelated articles ","Many software development projects fail because they do not deliver sufficient business benefit to justify the investment.

A DECISION-GUIDED GROUP PACKAGE RECOMMENDER BASED ON MULTI-CRITERIA OPTIMIZATION AND VOTING,"Alexander Brodsky, Daniel A Menascé, Larry Kerschberg, Karla Hoffman","Recommender systems are intended to help users make effective product and service choices, especially over the Internet. They are used in a variety of applications and have proven to be valuable for predicting the utility or relevance of a particular item and for providing personalized recommendations. While state-of-the-art recommender systems focus on atomic (single) products or services, and on individual users, this research focuses on extending recommender systems in three ways:(1) to consider composite (package), rather than atomic, recommendations;(2) to deal with multiple, rather than single, criteria associated with recommendations; and, most importantly,(3) to support groups of diverse users/decision makers who may have different, or even strongly conflicting, views on the weights of different criteria. In this research, we propose and develop a decision-guided group package recommender framework to provide a diverse set of optimal, or near optimal, package recommendations to groups of users while taking into account the influence of individuals within the group, the dissimilarity of interest among the group’s members, and the size and homogeneity of the group. The framework applies six alternative decision-making (voting) methods to refine the final recommendations. In addition, we develop, as a case study, the Power Microgrid Operation and Investment Recommender (PMOIR), which supports operational decisions on how to control each microgrid component on an hourly basis, and investment decisions on microgrid components (eg, renewable source of energy and power storage) over an investment time horizon …","Scholar articles A DECISION-GUIDED GROUP PACKAGE RECOMMENDER BASED ON MULTI-CRITERIA OPTIMIZATION AND VOTINGA Brodsky, DA Menascé, L Kerschberg, K Hoffman","Recommender systems are intended to help users make effective product and service choices, especially over the Internet.

Decision guidance approach to power network analysis: Developing an optimization technology solution to support management and,"Roberto Levy, Alexander Brodsky, Juan Luo","This paper focuses on developing an approach and technology for actionable recommendations on the operation of components of an electric power network. The overall direction of this research is to model the major components of a Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES), including power generation, transmission/distribution, power storage, energy markets, and end customer demand (residential and commercial). First, we propose a conceptual diagram notation for power network topology, to allow the representation of an arbitrary complex power system. Second, we develop a formal mathematical model that describes the HRES optimization framework, consisting of the different network components, their respective costs, and associated constraints. Third, we implement the HRES optimization problem solution through a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model by leveraging IBM Optimization Programming Language (OPL) CPLEX Studio. Lastly, we demonstrate the model through an example of a simulated network, showing also the ability to support sensitivity/what-if analysis, to determine the behavior of the network under different configurations.","Scholar articles Decision guidance approach to power network analysis: Developing an optimization technology solution to support management andR Levy, A Brodsky, J Luo","This paper focuses on developing an approach and technology for actionable recommendations on the operation of components of an electric power network.

"Duck Bong Kim, Seung-Jun Shin","Guodong Shao, Alexander Brodsky","Life cycle assessment (LCA) frameworks are widely used to assess the sustainability of manufacturing processes. Although they have several advantages such as systematic estimation and efficiency, they have significant limitations due to a lack of functionality to perform sustainability analysis. Specifically, they do not fully support dynamic and diverse characteristics of manufacturing processes nor cover technical details for the further analysis, such as simulation, prediction, and optimization. In addition, they do not provide a unified modeling environment in which to perform various sustainability analysis tasks. In this paper, a decision-guidance framework has been presented to improve sustainability in manufacturing processes while addressing the deficiencies in existing LCA frameworks. The proposed framework consists of six phases: goal and scope definition, data collection, model generation, sustainability performance analysis, interpretation, and decision support and guidance, which is designed in terms of functionality, usability, flexibility/reusability, and interoperability. To demonstrate the use of the framework, a case study of a turning process has been performed.","Scholar articles Duck Bong Kim, Seung-Jun ShinG Shao, A BrodskyRelated articles ","Life cycle assessment (LCA) frameworks are widely used to assess the sustainability of manufacturing processes.
