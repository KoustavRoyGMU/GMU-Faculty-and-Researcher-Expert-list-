"Recent Advances in Electrochemical Sensors for Detecting Toxic Gases: NO2, SO2 and H2S","Md Ashfaque Hossain Khan, Mulpuri V Rao, Qiliang Li",2019/2/21,Source Sensors,"Toxic gases, such as NOx, SOx, H2S and other S-containing gases, cause numerous harmful effects on human health even at very low gas concentrations. Reliable detection of various gases in low concentration is mandatory in the fields such as industrial plants, environmental monitoring, air quality assurance, automotive technologies and so on. In this paper, the recent advances in electrochemical sensors for toxic gas detections were reviewed and summarized with a focus on NO2, SO2 and H2S gas sensors. The recent progress of the detection of each of these toxic gases was categorized by the highly explored sensing materials over the past few decades. The important sensing performance parameters like sensitivity/response, response and recovery times at certain gas concentration and operating temperature for different sensor materials and structures have been summarized and tabulated to provide a thorough performance comparison. A novel metric, sensitivity per ppm/response time ratio has been calculated for each sensor in order to compare the overall sensing performance on the same reference. It is found that hybrid materials-based sensors exhibit the highest average ratio for NO2 gas sensing, whereas GaN and metal-oxide based sensors possess the highest ratio for SO2 and H2S gas sensing, respectively. Recently, significant research efforts have been made exploring new sensor materials, such as graphene and its derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), GaN, metal-metal oxide nanostructures, solid electrolytes and organic materials to detect the above-mentioned toxic gases.

Silicon nanowires as enhancement-mode Schottky barrier field-effect transistors,"Sang-Mo Koo, Monica D Edelstein, Qiliang Li, Curt A Richter, Eric M Vogel",2005/6/29,Journal Nanotechnology,Silicon nanowire field-effect transistors (SiNWFETs) have been fabricated with a highly simplified integration scheme to function as Schottky barrier transistors with excellent enhancement-mode characteristics and a high on/off current ratio∼ 10 7. SiNWFETs show significant improvement in the thermal emission leakage (∼ 6× 10− 13 A µm− 1) compared to reference FETs with a larger channel width (∼ 7× 10− 10 A µm− 1). The drain current level depends substantially on the contact metal work function as determined by examining devices with different source/drain contacts of Ti (≈ 4.33 eV) and Cr (≈ 4.50 eV). The different conduction mechanisms for accumulation-and inversion-mode operation are discussed and compared with two-dimensional numerical simulation results.,182
Enhanced channel modulation in dual-gated silicon nanowire transistors,"Sang-Mo Koo, Qiliang Li, Monica D Edelstein, Curt A Richter, Eric M Vogel",2005/12/14,Journal Nano letters,"Dual-gated silicon nanowire (SiNW) field-effect transistors (FETs) have been fabricated by using electron-beam lithography. SiNW devices (W ≈ 60 nm) exhibit an on/off current ratio greater than 106, which is more than 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of control devices prepared simultaneously having a large channel width (∼5 μm). In addition, by changing the local energy-band profile of the SiNW channel, the top gate is found to suppress ambipolar conduction effectively, which is one of the factors limiting the use of nanotube or nanowire FETs for complimentary logic applications. Two-dimensional numerical simulations show that the gate-induced electrostatic control is improved as the channel width of the FETs decreases. Therefore, enhanced channel modulations can be achieved in these dual-gated SiNW devices. ",173

With transistor channel lengths in the nanoscale regime, the six transistor static random access memory cell (6T-SRAM) and the (one transistor/one capacitor) dynamic memory (DRAM) both suffer from excessive leakage current. Consequently, there is a widely recognized need for urgent progress in memory technology. The thin capacitively coupled thyristor (TCCT) based memory cell (T-RAMs) approach is a most promising, CMOS compatible alternative to the standard cell both for SRAM and DRAM cell designs.

The effect of the trapping layer thickness of the nanowire memory cells has been experimentally measured and studied by simulation. As the thickness of HfO 2 increases from 5 to 30 nm, the charge trap density increases as expected, while the program/erase speed and retention remain the same. These data indicate that the electric field across the tunneling oxide is not affected by HfO 2 thickness, which is in good agreement with simulation results.

A novel water region visual detection method is proposed in this paper. First, the input image pixels are clustered into different regions and each pixel is assigned a label tag and a confidence value by adaptive multistage segmentation algorithm. Then the resulting label map and associated confidence map are fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) as training samples to train the network online. Finally, the online trained CNN is used to segment the input image again but with greater precision and stronger robustness. Compared with other deep-learning image segmentation algorithms, the proposed method has two advantages. Firstly, it dispenses with the need of manual labeling training samples which is a costly and painful task. Secondly, it allows real-time online training for CNN, making the network adaptive to the navigational environment. Another contribution of this work relates to the training process of neuro network.

A hierarchical vision-based UAV localization for an open landing,"Haiwen Yuan, Changshi Xiao, Supu Xiu, Wenqiang Zhan, Zhenyi Ye, Fan Zhang, Chunhui Zhou, Yuanqiao Wen, Qiliang Li",2018/5/11,Journal Electronics,"The localization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for autonomous landing is challenging because the relative positions of the landing objects are almost inaccessible and the objects have nearly no transmission with UAVs. In this paper, a hierarchical vision-based localization framework for rotor UAVs is proposed for an open landing. In such a hierarchical framework, the landing is defined into three phases: “Approaching”, “Adjustment”, and “Touchdown”. Object features at different scales can be extracted from a designed Robust and Quick Response Landing Pattern (RQRLP) and the corresponding detection and localization methods are introduced for the three phases. Then a federated Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) structure is costumed and utilizes the solutions of the three phases as independent measurements to estimate the pose of the vehicle. The framework can be used to integrate the vision solutions and enables the estimation to be smooth and robust. In the end, several typical field experiments have been carried out to verify the proposed hierarchical vision framework. It can be seen that a wider localization range can be extended by the proposed framework while the precision is ensured.",16

The results indicated that the first structure had higher collection efficiency while the second structure had a slightly better conversion gain. As a result, the total photoelectric voltage of the first structure is about two times that of the second structure, where low doping concentration (<1 × 1016 cm‒3) in the BPW region is preferred. Such a study of design and optimization of BPW technology is very important for applications in SOIPIX detectors.",

To realize reliable devices or test structures at nanoscale dimensions, key issues must be addressed including accurate control of the doping level of the NWs and the formation of reliable metal contacts. For these applications, the most fundamental and important structures made of SiNWs or CNTs are field-effect transistors (FETs) with direct metal contacts formed as the source and drain. 1-7",
Superior Photodynamic Effect of Single-walled Carbon Nanotubes in Aprotic Media: A Kinetic Study,"Xiaozhou Huang, Erin Witherspoon, Rui He, Yaonian Li, Jingjiang Yu, JinghaoHuang Huang, Chao Luo, Matthew Li, Tongchao Liu, Khalil Amine, Qiliang Li, Zhe Wang, Pei Dong",2023/1/5,Journal Materials Today Energy,"It has been confirmed that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) could generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aprotic media by utilizing photon energy. However, the impact of photon irradiation on SWCNTs and the kinetics of the generation process in aprotic media are still unclear, which significantly limits the yield performance. In this work, the kinetics for photodynamic effects has been investigated by performing characterizations on ultraviolet (UV)-treated SWCNTs using Raman spectroscopy, conductive atomic force microscope (in-situ), kelvin probe force microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is found that UV-treated SWCNTs are observed to have more defects, lower conductivity, and less surface charge after energy conversion. Starting from the fundamental intrinsic properties of SWCNTs, the kinetics and formation of these changes are thoroughly discussed. It turns out that the …",

The structure and optical properties were investigated by XRD, SEM, XPS and PL. XRD analysis indicated that the samples transform from YAM, YAP to YAG phase as the sintering temperature rises. The samples sintered below 1200á░C have a broad emission centered at 604ánm with a lifetime up to 13.33 μs under room temperature. While in the mix phase of YAP and YAG, a sharp and intense emission peak centered at 715ánm was monitored with a lifetime up to approximate 2.76áms. Moreover, the band structure and density of states for Te doped YAGwere investigated by first-principle calculations.",4
Experimental Study on the Unsteady Wake of a High-speed Train,"Chao Xia, Xizhuang Shan Di Bao, Qiliang Li, Zhigang Yang","The unsteady wake of a 1/50 scale high-speed train (HST) is investigated experimentally in a wind tunnel. Based on hot-wire anemometry and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurement, it can be observed that the wake of a slender HST is dominated by a pair of counter-rotating streamwise trailing vortices and periodical anti-symmetric vortex shedding; Each of the streamwise trailing vortices presents increase/decrease alternately in size and vorticity, along with spanwise and vertical oscillation, which could be attributed to vortex shedding shed from the sides of the tail train. In addition, the interaction between trailing vortices and the ground induces second vortices and intensifies the unsteady features in the wake.","Scholar articles Experimental Study on the Unsteady Wake of a High-speed TrainC Xia, XS Di Bao, Q Li, Z YangRelated articles ","The unsteady wake of a 1/50 scale high-speed train (HST) is investigated experimentally in a wind tunnel.

Silicon nanowire-based nonvolatile memory cells: Progress and prospects,"DE Ioannou, X Zhu, Y Yang, Qiliang Li, JS Suehle, CA Richter","There is a widely recognized need for urgent progress in nonvolatile memory (NVM) technology, driven by the exponential market growth of the ubiquitous portable and mobile electronics, such as cell phones, music players, USB and memory cards, etc. Commensurate with this demand, intensive research is carried out around the world to improve present technologies and invent new ones: for example, no fewer than eight (out of a total of thirty one) technical sessions at the 2007 IEDM meeting and one out of three plenary talks at the 2008 IEDM meeting were dedicated on memory cell technology.To enable continued scaling (Moore's law), NOR flash memory is been replaced (where possible) with the much denser NAND technology, but the industry consensus is that fundamentally new innovations must be introduced beyond the 45-nm lithography node generation [1]. One such innovation our research group and many others are pursuing is to design NVM cells based on silicon nanowires (SiNWs)[2]. There are several important reasons why SiNW NVM cells are outperforming conventional (planar) silicon NVM cells. First, because of the cylindrical symmetry, for the same value of the control gate voltage the electric field across the tunneling oxide is bigger than in comparable conventional cells, leading to either higher performance (faster program/erase), or to same performance at a lower power. Second, the cylindrical symmetry is particularly suitable for scaling NVM cells, where as short a channel length as possible is desired without reducing the gate oxide thickness too much, so that good retention is maintained.
