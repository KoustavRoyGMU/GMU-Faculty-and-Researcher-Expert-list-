Acculturation strategies among South Asian immigrants: the mediators of atherosclerosis in South Asians living in America (MASALA) study,"Belinda L Needham, Bhramar Mukherjee, Pramita Bagchi, Catherine Kim, Arnab Mukherjea, Namratha R Kandula, Alka M Kanaya",2017/4,Journal Journal of immigrant and minority health,"In the past, epidemiologic research on acculturation and health has been criticized for its conceptual ambiguity and simplistic measurement approaches. This study applied a widely-used theoretical framework from cross-cultural psychology to identify acculturation strategies among South Asian immigrants in the US and to examine sociodemographic correlates of acculturation strategies. Data were from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America study. We used latent class analysis to identify groups of individuals that were similar based on cultural attitudes and behaviors. We used latent class regression analysis to examine sociodemographic correlates of acculturation strategies. We found that South Asian immigrants employed three acculturation strategies, including separation (characterized by a relatively high degree of preference for South Asian culture over US culture …",36
Acculturation strategies and symptoms of depression: the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) Study,"Belinda L Needham, Bhramar Mukherjee, Pramita Bagchi, Catherine Kim, Arnab Mukherjea, Namratha R Kandula, Alka M Kanaya",2018/8,Journal Journal of immigrant and minority health,"Using latent class analysis, we previously identified three acculturation strategies employed by South Asian immigrants in the US. Members of the Separation class showed a preference for South Asian culture over US culture, while members of the Assimilation class showed a preference for US culture, and those in the Integration class showed a similar preference for South Asian and US cultures. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between these acculturation strategies and symptoms of depression, a common yet underdiagnosed and undertreated mental disorder. We used data from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) study (n = 856). Data were collected between October 2010 and March 2013 in the San Francisco Bay Area and Chicago. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D Scale. Applying a simple new method to …",19
A simple test for white noise in functional time series,"Pramita Bagchi, Vaidotas Characiejus, Holger Dette",2018/1,Journal Journal of Time Series Analysis,"We propose a new procedure for white noise testing of a functional time series. Our approach is based on an explicit representation of the L2‐distance between the spectral density operator and its best (L2‐)approximation by a spectral density operator corresponding to a white noise process. The estimation of this distance can be easily accomplished by sums of periodogram kernels, and it is shown that an appropriately standardized version of the estimator is asymptotically normal distributed under the null hypothesis (of functional white noise) and under the alternative. As a consequence, we obtain a very simple test (using the quantiles of the normal distribution) for the hypothesis of a white noise functional process. In particular, the test does not require either the estimation of a long‐run variance (including a fourth order cumulant) or resampling procedures to calculate critical values. Moreover, in contrast to all …",16

Inference for monotone functions under short-and long-range dependence: Confidence intervals and new universal limits,"Pramita Bagchi, Moulinath Banerjee, Stilian A Stoev",2016/10/1,Journal Journal of the American Statistical Association,"We introduce new point-wise confidence interval estimates for monotone functions observed with additive, dependent noise. Our methodology applies to both short- and long-range dependence regimes for the errors. The interval estimates are obtained via the method of inversion of certain discrepancy statistics. This approach avoids the estimation of nuisance parameters such as the derivative of the unknown function, which previous methods are forced to deal with. The resulting estimates are therefore more accurate, stable, and widely applicable in practice under minimal assumptions on the trend and error structure. The dependence of the errors especially long-range dependence leads to new phenomena, where new universal limits based on convex minorant functionals of drifted fractional Brownian motion emerge. Some extensions to uniform confidence bands are also developed. Supplementary materials …",9

On Effect of Compromised Nodes on Security of Wireless Sensor Network.,"Parichoy Pal Choudhury, Pramita Bagchi, Sebanti Sengupta, Anurag Ghosh",2010/7/1,Journal Adhoc & Sensor Wireless Networks,"For secure communications in wireless sensor network in adversarial conditions, one way is providing keys to sensor nodes before deployment. Two sensor nodes can communicate provided they have at least one key in common or there is a path between the two nodes where each pair of neighboring nodes on this path has at least one key in common. However node compromise poses severe security threats in sensor networks. Here we have considered dual BIBD design for the distribution of the keys such that any pair of sensors has exactly one key in common. In this scenario we study the probability of disconnection when a number of nodes, not more than the replication number of the keys are compromised and the resulting status of the network in terms of its resiliency properties.",6

A test for heteroscedasticity in functional linear models,"James Cameron, Pramita Bagchi",2022/6,Journal TEST,"We propose a new test to validate the assumption of homoscedasticity in a functional linear model. We consider a minimum distance measure of heteroscedasticity in functional data, which is zero in the case where the variance is constant and positive otherwise. We derive an explicit form of the measure, propose an estimator for the quantity, and show that an appropriately standardized version of the estimator is asymptotically normally distributed under both the null (homoscedasticity) and alternative hypotheses. We extend this result for residuals from functional linear models and develop a bootstrap diagnostic test for the presence of heteroscedasticity under the postulated model. Moreover, our approach also allows testing for “relevant” deviations from the homoscedastic variance structure and constructing confidence intervals for the proposed measure. We investigate the performance of our method using …",1

We generalize the greatest convex minorant characterization of isotonic regression estimator for the multivariate case and use it to establish the asymptotic distribution of properly normalized version of the estimator.

Adaptive Frequency Band Analysis for Functional Time Series,"Pramita Bagchi, Scott A Bruce",2021/2/2,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.01784,"The frequency-domain properties of nonstationary functional time series often contain valuable information. These properties are characterized through its time-varying power spectrum. Practitioners seeking low-dimensional summary measures of the power spectrum often partition frequencies into bands and create collapsed measures of power within bands. However, standard frequency bands have largely been developed through manual inspection of time series data and may not adequately summarize power spectra. In this article, we propose a framework for adaptive frequency band estimation of nonstationary functional time series that optimally summarizes the time-varying dynamics of the series. We develop a scan statistic and search algorithm to detect changes in the frequency domain. We establish theoretical properties of this framework and develop a computationally-efficient implementation. The validity of our method is also justified through numerous simulation studies and an application to analyzing electroencephalogram data in participants alternating between eyes open and eyes closed conditions.",

Non-Standard Statistical Inference Under Short and Long Range Dependence.,Pramita Bagchi,2015,"Description The work discusses different non-standard problems under different types of short and long range dependence.  In the first part we introduce new point-wise confidence interval estimates for monotone functions observed with additive and dependent noise. Existence of such monotone trend is quite common in time series data. We study both short- and long-range dependence regimes for the errors. The interval estimates are obtained via the method of inversion of certain discrepancy statistics. This approach avoids the estimation of nuisance parameters such as the derivative of the unknown function, which other methods are forced to deal with. The resulting estimates are therefore more accurate, stable, and widely applicable in practice under mild assumptions on the trend and error structure. While motivated by earlier work in the independent context, the dependence of the errors, especially long-range dependence leads to new phenomena and new universal limits based on convex minorant functionals of drifted fractional Brownian motion.  In the second part we investigate the problem of  M-estimation, the technique of extracting a parameter estimate by minimizing a loss function is used in almost every statistical problems. We focus on the general theory of such estimators in the presence of dependence in data, a very common feature in time series or econometric applications.  Unlike the case of independent and identically distributed observations, there is a lack of an overarching asymptotic theory for M-estimation under dependence.
