Cauldron: Mission-Centric Cyber Situational Awareness with Defense in Depth,"Sushil Jajodia, Steven Noel, Pramod Kalapa, Massimiliano Albanese, John Williams",2011/11,Conference Military Communications Conference (MILCOM 2011),"The cyber situational awareness of an organization determines its effectiveness in responding to attacks. Mission success is highly dependent on the availability and correct operation of complex computer networks, which are vulnerable to various types of attacks. Today, situational awareness capabilities are limited in many ways, such as inaccurate and incomplete vulnerability analysis, failure to adapt to evolving networks and attacks, inability to transform raw data into cyber intelligence, and inability for handling uncertainty. We describe advanced capabilities for mission-centric cyber situational awareness, based on defense in depth, provided by the Cauldron tool. Cauldron automatically maps all paths of vulnerability through networks, by correlating, aggregating, normalizing, and fusing data from a variety of sources. It provides sophisticated visualization of attack paths, with automatically generated mitigation …",152
A constrained probabilistic petri net framework for human activity detection in video,"Massimiliano Albanese, Rama Chellappa, Vincenzo Moscato, Antonio Picariello, VS Subrahmanian, Pavan Turaga, Octavian Udrea",2008/10,"Journal Multimedia, IEEE Transactions on"," Recognition of human activities in restricted settings such as airports, parking lots and banks is of significant interest in security and automated surveillance systems. In such settings, data is usually in the form of surveillance videos with wide variation in quality and granularity. Interpretation and identification of human activities requires an activity model that a) is rich enough to handle complex multi-agent interactions, b) is robust to uncertainty in low-level processing and c) can handle ambiguities in the unfolding of activities. We present a computational framework for human activity representation based on Petri nets. We propose an extension—Probabilistic Petri Nets (PPN)—and show how this model is well suited to address each of the above requirements in a wide variety of settings. We then focus on answering two types of questions: (i) what are the minimal sub-videos in which a given activity is identified with a …",150
Time-efficient and cost-effective network hardening using attack graphs,"Massimiliano Albanese, Sushil Jajodia, Steven Noel",2012/6/25,Conference IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2012),"Attack graph analysis has been established as a powerful tool for analyzing network vulnerability. However, previous approaches to network hardening look for exact solutions and thus do not scale. Further, hardening elements have been treated independently, which is inappropriate for real environments. For example, the cost for patching many systems may be nearly the same as for patching a single one. Or patching a vulnerability may have the same effect as blocking traffic with a firewall, while blocking a port may deny legitimate service. By failing to account for such hardening interdependencies, the resulting recommendations can be unrealistic and far from optimal. Instead, we formalize the notion of hardening strategy in terms of allowable actions, and define a cost model that takes into account the impact of interdependent hardening actions. We also introduce a near-optimal approximation algorithm that …",141
Network diversity: a security metric for evaluating the resilience of networks against zero-day attacks,"Mengyuan Zhang, Lingyu Wang, Sushil Jajodia, Anoop Singhal, Massimiliano Albanese",2016/1/12,Journal IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,"Diversity has long been regarded as a security mechanism for improving the resilience of software and networks against various attacks. More recently, diversity has found new applications in cloud computing security, moving target defense, and improving the robustness of network routing. However, most existing efforts rely on intuitive and imprecise notions of diversity, and the few existing models of diversity are mostly designed for a single system running diverse software replicas or variants. At a higher abstraction level, as a global property of the entire network, diversity and its effect on security have received limited attention. In this paper, we take the first step toward formally modeling network diversity as a security metric by designing and evaluating a series of diversity metrics. In particular, we first devise a biodiversity-inspired metric based on the effective number of distinct resources. We then propose two …",140
A multimedia recommender system,"Massimiliano Albanese, Antonio d’Acierno, Vincenzo Moscato, Fabio Persia, Antonio Picariello",2013/11/1,Journal ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),"The extraordinary technological progress we have witnessed in recent years has made it possible to generate and exchange multimedia content at an unprecedented rate. As a consequence, massive collections of multimedia objects are now widely available to a large population of users. As the task of browsing such large collections could be daunting, Recommender Systems are being developed to assist users in finding items that match their needs and preferences. In this article, we present a novel approach to recommendation in multimedia browsing systems, based on modeling recommendation as a social choice problem. In social choice theory, a set of voters is called to rank a set of alternatives, and individual rankings are aggregated into a global ranking. In our formulation, the set of voters and the set of alternatives both coincide with the set of objects in the data collection. We first define what constitutes a …",85
Scalable analysis of attack scenarios,"Massimiliano Albanese, Sushil Jajodia, Andrea Pugliese, V Subrahmanian",2011,Journal Computer Security–ESORICS 2011,"Attack graphs have been widely used for attack modeling, alert correlation, and prediction. In order to address the limitations of current approaches – scalability and impact analysis – we propose a novel framework to analyze massive amounts of alerts in real time, and measure the impact of current and future attacks. Our contribution is threefold. First, we introduce the notion of generalized dependency graph, which captures how network components depend on each other, and how the services offered by an enterprise depend on the underlying infrastructure. Second, we extend the classical definition of attack graph with the notion of timespan distribution, which encodes probabilistic knowledge of the attacker’s behavior. Finally, we introduce attack scenario graphs, which combine dependency and attack graphs, bridging the gap between known vulnerabilities and the services that could be ultimately …",72
A moving target defense approach to mitigate DDoS attacks against proxy-based architectures,"Sridhar Venkatesan, Massimiliano Albanese, Kareem Amin, Sushil Jajodia, Mason Wright",2016/10/17,Conference 2016 IEEE conference on communications and network security (CNS),"Distributed Denial of Service attacks against high-profile targets have become more frequent in recent years. In response to such massive attacks, several architectures have adopted proxies to introduce layers of indirection between end users and target services and reduce the impact of a DDoS attack by migrating users to new proxies and shuffling clients across proxies so as to isolate malicious clients. However, the reactive nature of these solutions presents weaknesses that we leveraged to develop a new attack - the proxy harvesting attack - which enables malicious clients to collect information about a large number of proxies before launching a DDoS attack. We show that current solutions are vulnerable to this attack, and propose a moving target defense technique consisting in periodically and proactively replacing one or more proxies and remapping clients to proxies. Our primary goal is to disrupt the …",71
A moving target defense approach for protecting resource-constrained distributed devices,"Valentina Casola, Alessandra De Benedictis, Massimiliano Albanese",2013/8/14,Conference 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration (IRI),"Techniques aimed at continuously changing a system's attack surface, usually referred to as Moving Target Defense (MTD), are emerging as powerful tools for thwarting cyber attacks.

A moving target defense mechanism for manets based on identity virtualization,"Massimiliano Albanese, Alessandra De Benedictis, Sushil Jajodia, Kun Sun",2013/10/14,Conference 2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),"Mechanisms for continuously changing or shifting a system's attack surface are emerging as game-changers in cyber security. In this paper, we propose a novel defense mechanism for protecting the identity of nodes in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks and defeat the attacker's reconnaissance efforts. The proposed mechanism turns a classical attack mechanism - Sybil - into an effective defense mechanism, with legitimate nodes periodically changing their virtual identity in order to increase the uncertainty for the attacker. To preserve communication among legitimate nodes, we modify the network layer by introducing (i) a translation service for mapping virtual identities to real identities; (ii) a protocol for propagating updates of a node's virtual identity to all legitimate nodes; and (iii) a mechanism for legitimate nodes to securely join the network. We show that the proposed approach is robust to different types of attacks, and …",53
CARA: A cultural-reasoning architecture,"VS Subrahmanian, Massimiliano Albanese, Maria Vanina Martinez, Dana Nau, Diego Reforgiato, Gerardo I Simari, Amy Sliva, Octavian Udrea, Jonathan Wilkenfeld",2007,Journal IEEE Intelligent Systems,"There's a constant need to reason about diverse cultures all over the world. Past cultural-reasoning research has focused primarily on techniques to organize, catalog, and reason about cultural and historical artifacts of the kind typically stored in a museum. This is extremely valuable. However, the term ""cultural reasoning"" as we use it in the previous examples (and in this article) focuses on understanding how different cultural groups today make decisions and what factors those decisions are based on. An architecture that supports cultural reasoning should, for example, be able to pinpoint characteristics that differentiate organizations engaging political action within legitimate frameworks from those engaging in violence and terror. Key in all this is that cultural reasoning must go hand in hand with environmental reasoning. We believe that any architecture to support cultural reasoning about a given group, political …",52
Fast activity detection: Indexing for temporal stochastic automaton-based activity models,"Massimiliano Albanese, Andrea Pugliese, VS Subrahmanian",2011/12/6,Journal IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,"Today, numerous applications require the ability to monitor a continuous stream of fine-grained data for the occurrence of certain high-level activities. A number of computerized systems-including ATM networks, web servers, and intrusion detection systems-systematically track every atomic action we perform, thus generating massive streams of timestamped observation data, possibly from multiple concurrent activities. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently detecting occurrences of high-level activities from such interleaved data streams. A solution to this important problem would greatly benefit a broad range of applications, including fraud detection, video surveillance, and cyber security. There has been extensive work in the last few years on modeling activities using probabilistic models.

Our approach combines usage patters with low-level features and semantic descriptors in order to predict users’ behavior and provide effective recommendations. The proposed paradigm is very general and can be applied to any type of multimedia data. In order to make the recommender system even more flexible, we introduce the concept of multichannel browser, i.e. a browser that allows concurrent browsing of multiple media channels.

Detecting stochastically scheduled activities in video,"Massimiliano Albanese, Vincenzo Moscato, Antonio Picariello, VS Subrahmanian, Octavian Udrea",2007/1/6,Journal Proc. of IJCAI,"The ability to automatically detect activities in video is of increasing importance in applications such as bank security, airport tarmac security, baggage area security and building site surveillance. We present a stochastic activity model composed of atomic actions which are directly observable through image understanding primitives. We focus on answering two types of questions:(i) what are the minimal sub-videos in which a given action is identified with probability above a certain threshold and (ii) for a given video, can we decide which activity from a given set most likely occurred? We provide the MPS algorithm for the first problem, as well as two different algorithms (naiveMPA and MPA) to solve the second. Our experimental results on a dataset consisting of staged bank robbery videos (described in [Vu et al., 2003]) show that our algorithms are both fast and provide high quality results when compared to human reviewers.",46

We then develop a probabilistic framework which assigns to any subvideo of a given video sequence a probability that the subvideo contains the given activity, and we finally develop two fast algorithms to detect activities within this framework. OffPad finds all minimal segments of a video that contain a given activity with a probability exceeding a given threshold.

Moving target defense against DDoS attacks: An empirical game-theoretic analysis,"Mason Wright, Sridhar Venkatesan, Massimiliano Albanese, Michael P Wellman",2016/10/24,Book Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense,"Distributed denial-of-service attacks are an increasing problem facing web applications, for which many defense techniques have been proposed, including several moving-target strategies. These strategies typically work by relocating targeted services over time, increasing uncertainty for the attacker, while trying not to disrupt legitimate users or incur excessive costs. Prior work has not shown, however, whether and how a rational defender would choose a moving-target method against an adaptive attacker, and under what conditions. We formulate a denial-of-service scenario as a two-player game, and solve a restricted-strategy version of the game using the methods of empirical game-theoretic analysis. Using agent-based simulation, we evaluate the performance of strategies from prior literature under a variety of attacks and environmental conditions.

A moving target defense approach to disrupting stealthy botnets,"Sridhar Venkatesan, Massimiliano Albanese, George Cybenko, Sushil Jajodia",2016/10/24,Conference Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense,"Botnets are increasingly being used for exfiltrating sensitive data from mission-critical systems. Research has shown that botnets have become extremely sophisticated and can operate in stealth mode by minimizing their host and network footprint. In order to defeat exfiltration by modern botnets, we propose a moving target defense approach for dynamically deploying detectors across a network. Specifically, we propose several strategies based on centrality measures to periodically change the placement of detectors. Our objective is to increase the attacker's effort and likelihood of detection by creating uncertainty about the location of detectors and forcing botmasters to perform additional actions in an attempt to create detector-free paths through the network. We present metrics to evaluate the proposed strategies and an algorithm to compute a lower bound on the detection probability. We validate our approach …",41
Discovering the top-k unexplained sequences in time-stamped observation data,"Massimiliano Albanese, Cristian Molinaro, Fabio Persia, Antonio Picariello, VS Subrahmanian",2013/4/22,Journal IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,"There are numerous applications where we wish to discover unexpected activities in a sequence of time-stamped observation data--for instance, we may want to detect inexplicable events in transactions at a website or in video of an airport tarmac.

Manipulating the attacker's view of a system's attack surface,"Massimiliano Albanese, Ermanno Battista, Sushil Jajodia, Valentina Casola",2014/10/29,Conference 2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security,"Cyber attacks are typically preceded by a reconnaissance phase in which attackers aim at collecting valuable information about the target system, including network topology, service dependencies, and unpatched vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, when system configurations are static, attackers will always be able, given enough time, to acquire accurate knowledge about the target system and engineer effective exploits. To address this important problem, many adaptive techniques have been devised to dynamically change some aspects of a system's configuration in order to introduce uncertainty for the attacker. In this paper, we advance the state of the art in adaptive defense by looking at the problem from a control perspective and proposing a graph-based approach to manipulate the attacker's view of a system's attack surface.

Network Hardening: An Automated Approach to Improving Network Security,"Lingyu Wang, Massimiliano Albanese, Sushil Jajodia",2014/7/8,Publisher Springer,"This Springer Brief examines the tools based on attack graphs that help reveal network hardening threats. Existing tools detail all possible attack paths leading to critical network resources. Though no current tool provides a direct solution to remove the threats, they are a more efficient means of network defense than relying solely on the experience and skills of a human analyst. Key background information on attack graphs and network hardening helps readers understand the complexities of these tools and techniques. A common network hardening technique generates hardening solutions comprised of initially satisfied conditions, thereby making the solution more enforceable. Following a discussion of the complexity issues in this technique, the authors provide an improved technique that considers the dependencies between hardening options and employs a near-optimal approximation algorithm to scale linearly with the size of the inputs. Also included are automated solutions for hardening a network against sophisticated multi-step intrusions. Network Hardening: An Automated Approach to Improving Network Security is a valuable resource for researchers and professionals working in network security. It is also a useful tool for advanced-level students focused on security in computer science and electrical engineering.",40

A Graphical Model to Assess the Impact of Multi-Step Attacks,"Massimiliano Albanese, Sushil Jajodia",2018/1/1,Journal The Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation,"In the last several decades, networked systems have grown in complexity and sophistication, introducing complex interdependencies amongst their numerous and diverse components. Attackers can leverage such interdependencies to penetrate seemingly well-guarded networks through sophisticated multi-step attacks. Research has shown that explicit and implicit interdependencies exist at various layers of the hardware and software architecture. In particular, dependencies between vulnerabilities and dependencies between applications and services are critical for assessing the impact of multi-step attacks. These two classes of interdependencies have been traditionally studied using attack and dependency graphs respectively. Although significant work has been done in the area of both attack and dependency graphs, we demonstrate that neither of these models can provide an accurate assessment of an …",35

Recognizing unexplained behavior in network traffic,"Massimiliano Albanese, Robert F Erbacher, Sushil Jajodia, Cristian Molinaro, Fabio Persia, Antonio Picariello, Giancarlo Sperlì, VS Subrahmanian",2014,Journal Network Science and Cybersecurity,"Intrusion detection and alert correlation are valuable and complementary techniques for identifying security threats in complex networks. Intrusion detection systems monitor network traffic for suspicious behavior, and trigger security alerts. Alert correlation methods can aggregate such alerts into multi-step attacks scenarios.

As a result, these methods are incapable of quantifying how well the underlying models explain what is observed on the network. To overcome this limitation, we present a framework for evaluating the probability that a sequence of events is not explained by a given a set of models.

Previous research has attempted to assess the risk associated with unknown attack patterns, and a suitable metric to quantify such risk, the k-zero-day safety metric, has been defined. However, existing algorithms for computing this metric are not scalable, and assume that complete zero-day attack graphs have been generated, which may be unfeasible in practice for large networks. In this paper, we propose a set of polynomial algorithms for estimating the k-zero-day safety of possibly large networks efficiently, without pre-computing the entire attack graph.

The quality of summaries was evaluated by a group of 200 students in Naples, Italy, who watched soccer videos. We show that PriCA is faster than existing algorithms and also produces better quality summaries.

In such a scenario users have to go through the returned documents in order to find what they are actually looking for. More often they would like to get targeted answers to their queries without extraneous information, even if their requirements are not well specified. In this paper we propose an approach for designing a web retrieval system able to find the desired information through several interactions with the users. The proposed approach allows to overcome the problems deriving from ambiguous or too vague queries, using semantic search and topic detection techniques.

The principal contribution of this paper is the development of a scalable system called T-REX (short for “The RDF EXtractor”) that allows us to extract instances associated with a user-specified schema, independently of the domain about which we wish to extract data. Using T-REX, we have successfully extracted information about various aspects of about 20 tribes living in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

In order to address this problem, we propose a proactive approach to strategically deploy detectors on selected network nodes, so as to either completely disrupt communication between bots and command and control nodes, or at least force the attacker to create more bots, therefore increasing the footprint of the botnet and the likelihood of detection. As the detector placement problem is intractable, we propose heuristics based on several centrality measures. Simulations results confirm that our approach can …",12

The tactical advantages that MTD can provide to the defender have led to the development of a vast array of diverse techniques, which are designed to operate under different constraints and against different classes of threats. Due to the diverse nature of these various techniques and the lack of shared metrics to assess their benefits and cost, comparing multiple techniques is not a trivial task. We addressed this gap by designing a framework to enable a uniform approach to the analysis and quantification of MTD techniques. This framework looks at each MTD technique in terms of the attacker’s knowledge it is capable of compromising, thus enabling direct comparison of any two techniques or set of techniques.",5

Proceedings 17","Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) represent an attractive and cost effective solution for providing connectivity in areas where a fixed infrastructure is not available or not a viable option. However, given their wireless nature and the lack of a stable infrastructure, MANETs are susceptible to a wide range of attacks waged by malicious nodes physically located within the transmission range of legitimate nodes. Whilst most research has focused on methods for detecting attacks, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for estimating – independently of the type of attack – the physical location of attackers, based on the location of nodes that have detected malicious activity in their neighborhood. We assume that certain countermeasures can be deployed to capture or isolate malicious nodes, and they can provide feedback on whether an attacker is actually present in a target region.

A quantitative framework to model reconnaissance by stealthy attackers and support deception-based defenses,"Luan Huy Pham, Massimiliano Albanese, Ritu Chadha, Cho-Yu J Chiang, Sridhar Venkatesan, Charles Kamhoua, Nandi Leslie",2020/6/29,Conference 2020 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),"In recent years, persistent cyber adversaries have developed increasingly sophisticated techniques to evade detection. Once adversaries have established a foothold within the target network, using seemingly-limited passive reconnaissance techniques, they can develop significant network reconnaissance capabilities. Cyber deception has been recognized as a critical capability to defend against such adversaries, but, without an accurate model of the adversary’s reconnaissance behavior, current approaches are ineffective against advanced adversaries. To address this gap, we propose a novel model to capture how advanced, stealthy adversaries acquire knowledge about the target network and establish and expand their foothold within the system. This model quantifies the cost and reward, from the adversary’s perspective, of compromising and maintaining control over target nodes. We evaluate our model …",4

A Quantitative Framework to Model Advanced Persistent Threats,"Luan Huy Pham, Massimiliano Albanese, and Benjamin W. Priest",2018/7/26,Conference 15th International Conference on Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT 2018),"In recent years, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have emerged as increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, often waged by state actors or other hostile organizations against high-profile targets. APT actors employ a diversified set of sophisticated tools and advanced capabilities to penetrate target systems, evade detection, and maintain a foothold within compromised systems for extended periods of time. Stealth and persistence enable APT actors to conduct long-term espionage and sabotage operations. Despite significant efforts to develop APT detection and mitigation capabilities, the stealthy nature of APTs poses significant challenges, and defending from such threats is still an open research problem. In particular, quantitative models to capture how APTs may create and maintain a foothold within a target system are lacking. To address this gap, we propose a quantitative framework to (i) assess the cost incurred by APT actors to compromise and persist within a target system;(ii) estimate the value they gain over time by persisting in the system;(iii) simulate how the footprint of an APT evolves over time when, to maintain stealth, attackers have constraints on the volume of potentially detectable activity they can engage in. We also propose a preliminary defender model, and results from the evaluation show that our approach is promising, thus encouraging further research in this direction.",3

Extracting and summarizing information from large data repositories.,Massimiliano Albanese,2006,"Institution University of Naples Federico II, Italy","Information retrieval from large data repositories has become an important area of computer science. Research in this field is highly encouraged by the ever-increasing rate with which today’s society is able to produce digital data. Unfortunately most of such data (eg video recordings, plain text documents) are unstructured. Two major issues thus arise in this scenario: i) extracting structured data–information–from unstructured data; ii) summarizing information, ie reducing large volumes of information to a short summary or abstract comprising only the most essential facts. In this thesis, techniques for extracting and summarizing information from large data repositories are presented. In particular the attention is focused onto two kinds of repositories: video data collections and natural language text document repositories. We show how the same principles can be applied for summarizing information in both domains and present solutions tailored to each domain. The thesis presents a novel video summarization algorithm, the Priority Curve Algorithm, that outperforms previous solutions, and three heuristic algorithms, OptStory+, GenStory and DynStory, for creating succinct stories about entities of interest using the information collected by algorithms that extract structured data from heterogenous data sources. In particular a Text Attribute Extraction (TAE) algorithm for extracting information from natural language text is presented.

Proactive defense through deception,"Massimiliano Albanese, Sushil Jajodia",2019/8/30,Book Industrial Control Systems Security and Resiliency: Practice and Theory,"Cyberattacks are typically preceded by a reconnaissance phase in which attackers aim at collecting valuable information about the target system, including network topology, service dependencies, operating systems (OSs), and unpatched vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, when system configurations are static, given enough time, attackers can always acquire accurate knowledge about the target system through a variety of tools—including OS and service fingerprinting—and engineer effective exploits. To address this important problem and increase the resiliency of systems against known and unknown attacks, many techniques have been devised to dynamically and periodically change some aspects of a system’s configuration in order to introduce uncertainty for the attacker.

Vulnerability Metrics for Graph-based Configuration Security.,"Ibifubara Iganibo, Massimiliano Albanese, Marc Mosko, Eric Bier, Alejandro E Brito",2021,Conference SECRYPT,"Vulnerability analysis has long been used to evaluate the security posture of a system, and vulnerability graphs have become an essential tool for modeling potential multi-step attacks and assessing a system’s attack surface. More recently, vulnerability graphs have been adopted as part of a multi-faceted approach to configuration analysis and optimization that aims at leveraging relationships between the components, configuration parameters, and vulnerabilities of a complex system to improve its security while preserving functionality. However, this approach still lacks robust metrics to quantify several important aspects of the system being modeled. To address this limitation, we introduce metrics to enable practical and effective application of graph-based configuration analysis and optimization. Specifically, we define metrics to evaluate (i) the exploitation likelihood of a vulnerability,(ii) probability distributions over the edges of a vulnerability graph, and (iii) exposure factors of system components to vulnerabilities. Our approach builds upon standard vulnerability scoring systems, and we show that the proposed metrics can be easily extended. We evaluate our approach against the Common Weakness Scoring System (CWSS), showing a high degree of correlation between CWE scores and our metrics.",1

DeBot: A Novel Network-based Mechanism to Detect Exfiltration by Architectural Stealthy Botnets,"Sridhar Venkatesan, Massimiliano Albanese, Cho-Yu Jason Chiang, Angelo Sapello, Ritu Chadha",2018/12/5,Journal Security and Privacy,"Malicious actors use networks of compromised and remotely controlled hosts, known as botnets, to execute different classes of cyberattacks, including exfiltration of sensitive data. Recently, we have observed a trend toward more resilient botnet architectures, departing from traditional centralized architectures and enabling botnets to evade detection and persist in a system indefinitely. Botnets can achieve resilience through architectural stealth, by establishing overlay networks that minimize exposure of malicious traffic to detectors. To address this problem, we propose a novel network‐based detection scheme, called DeBot, which identifies traffic flows associated with exfiltration attempts. The proposed solution intercepts traffic from different monitoring points and leverages differences in the network behavior of botnets and benign users to identify suspicious flows.

As a foundation for future research regarding the inclusion of this variable, we analyzed properties and relevant distributions of exploits from the Exploit Database, an archive of exploit scripts and proof-of-concepts. First, we explored the distribution of vulnerabilities by number of exploits, enumerating vulnerabilities with at least one known exploit. Next, we examined relationships between exploits, vulnerabilities, and time. We found that in general, older vulnerabilities tend to have more exploits. We …",

Poster: Securing Distributed System Configuration through Optimization and Reasoning on Graphs,"Hamed Soroush, Shantanu Rane, Massimiliano Albanese","Complex distributed systems are inherently difficult to secure due to the many interdependencies amongst their components, vulnerabilities, and configuration parameters. To address this problem, we present an approach for improving the security posture of distributed systems by examining the security impact of configuration changes across their interdependent components. We construct a graph-based model of the system and its vulnerabilities and use it to analyze the attack surface and the impact of attacks. We show how the model can be optimized using SMT solvers to derive configurations that minimize the impact of attacks while preserving system functionality.","Scholar articles Poster: Securing Distributed System Configuration through Optimization and Reasoning on GraphsH Soroush, S Rane, M AlbaneseRelated articles All 3 versions ","Complex distributed systems are inherently difficult to secure due to the many interdependencies amongst their components, vulnerabilities, and configuration parameters.

Mission-Centric Cyber Situational Awareness with Defense in Depth,"Sushil Jajodia, Steven Noel, Pramod Kalapa, Massimiliano Albanese, John Williams","Cyber situational awareness determines timeliness, cost effectiveness, and success in responding to attacks. Mission success depends on complex computer networks, which are vulnerable to various types of attacks. Today, situational awareness capabilities are limited in many ways, such as inaccurate and incomplete vulnerability analysis, failure to adapt to evolving networks and attacks, inability to transform raw data into cyber intelligence, and inability for handling anomalous data. We describe advanced capabilities for mission-centric cyber situational awareness, based on defense in depth, provided by the Cauldron tool. Cauldron maps all paths of vulnerability through networks, by correlating, aggregating, normalizing, and fusing data from a variety of sources. It provides sophisticated visualization of attack paths, with automatically generated mitigation recommendations. Flexible modeling supports multistep analysis of firewall rules as well as host-to-host vulnerability, with attack vectors inside the network as well as from the outside. We describe alert correlation based on Cauldron attack graphs, along with analysis of mission impact from attacks.","Scholar articles Mission-Centric Cyber Situational Awareness with Defense in DepthS Jajodia, S Noel, P Kalapa, M Albanese, J WilliamsRelated articles ","Cyber situational awareness determines timeliness, cost effectiveness, and success in responding to attacks.
