Modeling a no-slip flow boundary with an external force field,"D Goldstein, R Handler, L Sirovich",1993/4/1,Journal Journal of computational physics,"A novel technique related to Peskin's immersed boundary approach is used to introduce solid surfaces into a simulated flow field. The Navier-Stokes equations permit the presence of an externally imposed body force that may vary in space and time. Forces are chosen to lie along a desired surface and to have a magnitude and direction opposing the local flow such that the flow is brought to rest on an element of the surface. For unsteady viscous flow the direct calculation of the needed force is facilitated by a feedback scheme in which the velocity is used to iteratively determine the desired value. In particular, we determine the surface body force from the relation f(x5, t ) = α ∫t0 U(x5, t′ ) dt′ + βU(x5, t) for surface points x5, velocity U, time t, and negative constants α and β. Examples are presented which include 2D flow around cylinders, 3D turbulent channel flow where one boundary is simulated with a force field …",1505
Direct numerical simulation of the turbulent channel flow of a polymer solution,"R Sureshkumar, Antony N Beris, Robert A Handler",1997/3,Journal Physics of Fluids,"In this work, we present from first principles a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a fully turbulent channel flow of a dilute polymer solution. The polymer chains are modeled as finitely extensible and elastic dumbbells. The simulation algorithm is based on a semi-implicit, time-splitting technique which uses spectral approximations in the spatial coordinates. The computations are carried out on a CRAY T3D parallel computer. The simulations are carried out under fully turbulent conditions albeit, due to computational constraints, not at as high Reynolds number as that usually encountered in polymer-induced drag reduction experiments. In order to compensate for the lower Reynolds number, we simulate more elastic fluids than the ones encountered in drag reduction experiments resulting in Weissenberg numbers (a dimensionless number characterizing the flow elasticity) of similar magnitude. The simulations show …",492
Effect of temperature on the surface tension of soluble and insoluble surfactants of hydrodynamical importance,"Supathorn Phongikaroon, Ryan Hoffmaster, K Peter Judd, Geoffrey B Smith, Robert A Handler",2005/9/8,Journal Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data,"The effect of temperature on the surface tension of soluble and insoluble surfactants was investigated at an air−water interface. Equilibrium surface tension measurements were performed using the Wilhelmy plate technique in which both temperature and concentration were varied systematically. Insoluble surfactants (oleyl alcohol and hemicyanine) and soluble surfactants (Triton X-100 and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) were used since they are commonly used in hydrodynamic experiments in which the effects of surfactants on free surface dynamics are studied. The principal result of this investigation is that the surface tension of the above-mentioned surfactants decreases linearly with temperature, independent of concentration, with the exception of oleyl alcohol whose surface tension becomes relatively independent of temperature above 23 °C. The adequacy of standard models for surfactant behavior in …",344
Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flow over a modeled riblet covered surface,"D Goldstein, R Handler, L Sirovich",1995/11,Journal Journal of Fluid Mechanics,"An immersed boundary technique is used to model a riblet covered surface on one wall of a channel bounding fully developed turbulent flow. The conjecture that the beneficial drag reduction effect of riblets is a result of the damping of cross-flow velocity fluctuations is then examined. This possibility has been discussed by others but is unverified. The damping effect is explicitly modelled by applying a cross-flow damping force field in elongated streamwise zones with a height and spacing corresponding to the riblet crests. The same trends are observed in the turbulence profiles above both riblet and damped surfaces, thus supporting cross-flow damping as a beneficial mechanism. It is found in the examples presented that the effect of the riblets on the mean flow field quantities (mean velocity profile, velocity fluctuations, Reynolds shear stress, and low–speed sreak spacing) is small. The riblests cause a relatively …",307
Vortex dynamics and the production of Reynolds stress,"Peter S Bernard, James M Thomas, Robert A Handler",1993/8,Journal Journal of Fluid Mechanics,"The physical mechanisms by which the Reynolds shear stress is produced from dynamically evolving vortical structures in the wall region of a direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow are explored. The complete set of quasistreamwise vortices are systematically located and tracked through the flow by the locus of the points of intersection of their centres of rotation with the (y, z) numerical grid planes. This approach assures positive identification of vortices of widely differing strengths, including those whose amplitude changes significantly in time. The process of vortex regeneration, and the means by which vortices grow, distort and interact over time are noted. Ensembles of particle paths arriving on fixed planes in the flow are used to represent the physical processes of displacement and acceleration transport (Bernard & Handler 1990a) from which the Reynolds stress is produced. By interweaving the …",235
Length scales and the energy balance for turbulence near a free surface,"RA Handler, TF Swean Jr, RI Leighton, JD Swearingen",1993/11,Journal AIAA journal,"The structure of turbulence near a free surface is examined by using results obtained from a direct simulation of flow between a no-slip wall and a shear free boundary, which serves as a model of a waveless free surface. An energy balance analysis shows that the pressure-strain term is the dominant producing term for the spanwise component of the turbulent kinetic energy. In addition, the dissipation rates for the horizontal components of the turbulence are reduced near the free surface, whereas the dissipation rate for the vertical component remains approximately constant. Two-point correlations, energy spectra, and length scales reveal important free surface induced effects. The length scales near the free surface are compared with the scales near the centerline of normal turbulent channel flow. This comparison reveals an increase by a factor of three in the streamwise length scales associated with the spanwise …",175
Empirical orthogonal function analysis of ocean surface currents using complex and real-vector methods,"James M Kaihatu, Robert A Handler, George O Marmorino, Lynn K Shay",1998/8/1,Journal Journal of atmospheric and oceanic technology,"Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis has been widely used in meteorology and oceanography to extract dominant modes of behavior in scalar and vector datasets. For analysis of two-dimensional vector fields, such as surface winds or currents, use of the complex EOF method has become widespread. In the present paper, this method is compared with a real-vector EOF method that apparently has previously been unused for current or wind fields in oceanography or meteorology. It is shown that these two methods differ primarily with respect to the concept of optimal representation. Further, the real-vector analysis can easily be extended to three-dimensional vector fields, whereas the complex method cannot. To illustrate the differences between approaches, both methods are applied to Ocean Surface Current Radar data collected off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in June and July 1993. For this dataset …",161
"Budgets of Reynolds stress, kinetic energy and streamwise enstrophy in viscoelastic turbulent channel flow","Costas D Dimitropoulos, R Sureshkumar, Antony N Beris, Robert A Handler",2001/4,Journal Physics of Fluids,"The budgets of the Reynolds stress, turbulent kinetic energy and streamwise enstrophy are evaluated through direct numerical simulations for the turbulent channel flow of a viscoelastic polymer solution modeled with the Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic with the Peterlin approximation (FENE-P) constitutive equation. The influence of viscoelasticity on the budgets is examined through a comparison of the Newtonian and the viscoelastic budgets obtained for the same constant pressure drop across the channel. It is observed that as the extensional viscosity of the polymer solution increases there is a consistent decrease in the production of Reynolds stress in all components, as well as in the other terms in the budgets. In particular, the effect of the flow elasticity, which is associated with the reduction in the intensity of the velocity-pressure gradient correlations, potentially leads to a redistribution of the turbulent …",153
Transport of a passive scalar at a shear-free boundary in fully developed turbulent open channel flow,"RA Handler, JR Saylor, RI Leighton, AL Rovelstad",1999/9,Journal Physics of Fluids,"Direct numerical simulations of fully developed turbulence in an open channel geometry were performed in which a passive scalar was introduced. The simulations were intended to explore transport at free surfaces in two cases for which (1) the free surface was maintained at constant temperature and (2) the interfacial flux was fixed. These cases can be considered models for mass and evaporative heat transport where buoyancy and surface deformation effects are negligible. Significant differences were found in the thermal fields in these two cases. The turbulent statistics reveal that the surface flux in the constant temperature case was significantly more intermittent compared to the surface temperature field in the constant flux case. The surface temperature field in the latter case formed large patches of warm fluid, reminiscent of the so-called fish scale patterns revealed in recent infrared imagery of the air–water …",122
The Karhunen–Loeve decomposition of minimal channel flow,"George Andrew Webber, RA Handler, L Sirovich",1997/4,Journal Physics of Fluids,"Minimal channel flow is analyzed by means of the Karhunen–Loéve (KL) decomposition. It is shown that the most energetic modes are streamwise rollers followed by outward tilted quasi-streamwise vortices. Both of these mode types have a strong similarity to structures seen in physical experiments. Temporal plots of roll energy, propagating energy, bulk velocity, and representational entropy have been obtained. Study of the evolution of these variables shows a consistent pattern of growth and decay in which entropy plays a key role in describing the events in the turbulent process. The roll and propagating modes are also shown to make independent contributions to the Reynolds stress with the roll modes dominating the profile near the walls and the propagating modes having larger values towards the channel center. A comparison of the KL dimension of this flow and a full channel flow shows that the dimension …",95
Statistical analysis of coherent vortices near a free surface in a fully developed turbulence,"Ryuichi Nagaosa, Robert A Handler",2003/2/7,Journal Physics of Fluids,"The dynamics of coherent vortices, their interactions with an unsheared gas–liquid interface, i.e., free surface, and their contribution to turbulent heat transfer has been investigated in a fully developed turbulence using the results from a direct numerical simulation. Fully resolved free surface turbulence simulations were performed at Reynolds numbers of  and  based on the wall shear velocity and water depth. Passive heat transfer at a Prandtl number of  is enforced by imposing a constant temperature difference between the bottom no-slip boundary and free surface. Instantaneous turbulent flow realizations are stored and used to establish a database from which the statistical properties of the flow can be established. The three-dimensional two-point correlations between the total heat flux at the free surface and the subsurface hydrodynamics are evaluated to determine the spatial extent of the coherent …",88
Propagating structures in wall-bounded turbulent flows,"L Sirovich, KS Ball, RA Handler",1991/8,Journal Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics,The Karhunen—Loève procedure is used to analyze two turbulent channel flow simulations. In both instances this reveals the presence of propagating plane wave structures in the turbulent flows. These waves appear to play an essential role in the local production of turbulence via bursting or sweeping events. The envelope of the propagating modes propagates with a speed which is equal to the mean velocity at the locus of maximal average Reynolds stress. Despite marked differences between the two flows similar results are obtained from each simulation. This is suggestive of the existence of universal or near universal features in the turbulent boundary layer. An analogy with critical layer mechanisms of transitional flows is discussed.,88
Dynamics and stability of a vortex ring impacting a solid boundary,"JD Swearingen, JD Crouch, RA Handler",1995/8,Journal Journal of Fluid Mechanics,"Direct numerical simulations were used to study the dynamics of a vortex ring impacting a wall at normal incidence. The boundary layer formed as the ring approaches the wall undergoes separation and roll-up to form a secondary vortex ring. The secondary ring can develop azimuthal instabilities which grow rapidly owing to vortex stretching and tilting in the presence of the mean strain field generated by the primary vortex ring. The stability of the secondary ring was investigated through complementary numerical experiments and stability analysis. Both perturbed and unperturbed evolutions of the secondary ring were simulated at a Reynolds number of about 645, based on the initial primary-ring propagation velocity and ring diameter. The linear evolution of the secondary vortex-ring instability was modelled analytically by making use of a quasi-steady approximation. This allowed a localized stability analysis …",81
Viscoelastic effects on higher order statistics and on coherent structures in turbulent channel flow,"Kostas D Housiadas, Antony N Beris, Robert A Handler",2005/3/8,Journal Physics of Fluids,"In this work we study, using the results of direct numerical simulations [Housiadas and Beris, “Polymer-induced drag reduction: Viscoelastic and inertia effects of the variations in viscoelasticity and inertia,” Phys. Fluids 15, 2369 (2003)], the effects of changes in the flow viscoelasticity and the friction Reynolds number on several higher order statistics of turbulence, such as the Reynolds stress, the enstrophy, the averaged equations for the conformation tensor, as well as on the coherent structures through a Karhunen–Loeve  analysis and selected flow and conformation visualizations. In particular, it is shown that, as the zero friction Weissenberg number  increases (for a constant zero friction Reynolds number ) dramatic reductions take place in many terms in the averaged equations for the Reynolds stresses and in all terms of the averaged enstrophy equations.

Reynolds stress and the physics of turbulent momentum transport,"Peter S Bernard, Robert A Handler",1990/11,Journal Journal of fluid mechanics,"The nature of the momentum transport processes responsible for the Reynolds shear stress is investigated using several ensembles of fluid particle paths obtained from a direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow. It is found that the Reynolds stress can be viewed as arising from two fundamentally different mechanisms. The more significant entails transport in the manner described by Prandtl in which momentum is carried unchanged from one point to another by the random displacement of fluid particles. One-point models, such as the gradient law are found to be inherently unsuitable for representing this process. However, a potentially useful non-local approximation to displacement transport, depending on the global distribution of the mean velocity gradient, may be developed as a natural consequence of its definition. A second important transport mechanism involves fluid particles experiencing …",67
Drag reduction in turbulent channel flow by phase randomization,"RA Handler, E Levich, L Sirovich",1993/3,Journal Physics of Fluids A: Fluid Dynamics,"Results of numerical simulations of plane turbulent channel flow are presented in which a forcing is introduced which derives from the randomization of selected Fourier modes. In all cases, the randomization is introduced uniformly throughout the channel. The properties of the resulting turbulence are strongly dependent on both the wave numbers whose phases are randomized and the forcing frequency. Two principal wave‐number bands have been selected. The first includes a selected subset of the largest length scales of the turbulence. Forcing in this band results in a fully sustained maximum mass flux increase above that of normal turbulence of 30%, which translates into a drag reduction of 58%. Many of the statistical properties of the simulated drag‐reduced turbulence generated in this manner are in good qualitative agreement with the statistical properties of turbulence observed in experiments in which …",61
The thermal structure of an air–water interface at low wind speeds,"RA Handler, GB Smith, RI Leighton",2001/3,Journal Tellus A,"High‐resolution infrared imagery of an air–water interface at wind speeds of 1 to 4 ms−1 was obtained. Spectral analysis of the data reveals several important features of the thermal structure of the so‐called cool skin. At wind speeds for which wind waves are not generated, the interfacial boundary layer appears to be composed of buoyant plumes that are stretched by the surface shear as they reach the interface. The plumes appear to form overlapping laminae with a head‐tail structure which we have termed fish‐scales. At higher wind speeds, gravity waves appearing on the surface give rise to distinct signatures in the infrared imagery. The wave system appears to modulate the surface temperature with sufficient strength so that the length and time scales of the waves are readily revealed in a k‐ω spectrum. A surface drift speed can also be easily inferred from the spectrum. A direct numerical simulation of the …",60
Gas transport across an air/water interface populated with capillary waves,"JR Saylor, RA Handler",1997/9,Journal Physics of Fluids,"An experimental study of gas transport across an air/water interface, populated by a field of standing capillary waves is presented. The experiments were conducted in a small tank containing distilled water, enriched with carbon dioxide. The capillary waves were of the Faraday type, generated by providing a small vertical vibration to the water tank. The frequency of excitation was varied from 200 to 400 Hz, giving wavelengths from 3.62 to 2.26 mm (linear estimate). The gas transport rate across the interface increased by almost two orders of magnitude as the wave slope was increased from zero to slightly above 0.2 m/m. A unique aspect of these experiments is that capillary waves were isolated from the obfuscating effects of turbulence, aerosol generation, and other phenomena typically present in wind/wave tunnel experiments. Consequently the large enhancement in gas transfer was due to the effects of capillary …",52
An EOF analysis of HF Doppler radar current measurements of the Chesapeake Bay buoyant outflow,"GO Marmorino, LK Shay, BK Haus, RA Handler, HC Graber, MP Horne",1999/2/1,Journal Continental Shelf Research,"Surface currents measured by HF Doppler radar as part of a study of the Chesapeake Bay outflow plume are examined using a ‘real-vector’ empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis (Kaihatu et al., 1998). Based on about 23 days of nearly continuous data, the analysis shows that the first three EOF modes, judged to be the only significant modes, account for 76% of the variance in the data set. The buoyant outflow occurs primarily in the mean flow field. The first EOF mode is dominated by wind forcing and the second mode by across-shelf semi-diurnal tidal forcing. The third mode exhibits a large-scale horizontal shear and contains a curved region of weak relative flow which appears to delineate the offshore edge of the plume; also, the third-mode response varies over the spring-neap cycle, suggesting a modulation of the outflow plume by a tidal residual eddy. The analysis therefore has provided a useful …",40
Direct numerical simulations of free convection beneath an air–water interface at low Rayleigh numbers,"RI Leighton, GB Smith, RA Handler",2003/10/5,Journal Physics of Fluids,"Direct numerical simulations of a cooling air–water interface were employed to determine the structure of the temperature, velocity, and vorticity fields in the thin thermal boundary layer formed at the free surface. The simulations were performed at low to moderate Rayleigh numbers. In this flow, the turbulence is initiated by the Rayleigh instability at the interface and is maintained by buoyant production. Visualizations of the flow reveal that the temperature field at the interface is composed of large warm patches surrounded by cooler dense fluid which accumulates in thin bands. The cool fluid associated with the bands initially falls in sheets, but rapidly forms descending tubes and plumes. The turbulence statistics were scaled both with outer and inner variables. The latter scaling is based on the so-called surface strain model which is essentially consistent with Townsend’s inner scaling. It is found that the temperature …",39
Low Reynolds number calculation of turbulent channel flow: a general discussion,"RA Handler, EW Hendricks, RI Leighton",1989/2/23,Publisher NAVAL RESEARCH LAB WASHINGTON DC,"The statistical properties of turbulent flow in a channel at a wall Reynolds number of 125 using a moderate resolution direct numerical simulation is investigated. We have found that the use of a Green function method results in turbulent statistics which are significantly closer to experimental results than those produced by the Orszag-Kells 1980 splitting method. We have found some differences between our calculations and those of Kim, Moin and Moser 1987 KMM. Our calculation gives somewhat lower turbulent intensities and longer streamwise correlation lengths. In general, however, the one and two point statistics are in good agreement with the KMM results. Conditional sampling calculations on the simulated data indicate a definite relationship between VITA and Q2 events. We have also found that aliasing errors cause strong damping effects on the final steady state turbulent velocity field.",39
Surfactant effects on passive scalar transport in a fully developed turbulent flow,"RA Handler, RI Leighton, GB Smith, Ryuichi Nagaosa",2003/6/1,Journal International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,"Direct numerical simulations of fully developed turbulence in an open channel were performed. Effects of surfactants on heat transfer and the underlying turbulent structures were investigated. As surface elasticity is increased turbulent fluctuations are damped and the mean surface temperature is decreased. A surface strain model is introduced to explain this behavior in a heuristic manner. A nondimensional parameter representing the ratio of surface elastic forces to local inertial forces is introduced. It is concluded that for values of the parameter of order one, surfactants have strong effects on surface turbulence, whereas an effectively clean surface can be obtained for parameter values less than O(10−3).",36
An analysis of particle trajectories in computer‐simulated turbulent channel flow,"Peter S Bernard, Mohamed F Ashmawey, Robert A Handler",1989/9,Journal Physics of Fluids A: Fluid Dynamics,"The origin of Reynolds stress in turbulent channel flow is analyzed using several ensembles of particle paths computed in a direct numerical simulation. The time interval over which the paths are calculated is shown by several criteria to be sufficiently long so that complete mixing of the particle momenta with the surroundings has occurred. The corresponding mixing length is determined and found to be within the range required by a gradient transport model. However, a small fraction of the particles, which tend to be associated with highly vortical sweep and ejection events, travel well beyond the mixing length and collectively make a major nongradient contribution to Reynolds stress. It is suggested that further analysis of these motions may lead to useful formulas for predicting the nongradient component of momentum transport.",36
The thermal signature of a vortex pair impacting a free surface,"Geoffrey B Smith, RJ Volino, RA Handler, RI Leighton",2001/10,Journal Journal of Fluid Mechanics,"The action of a rising vortex pair on the thermal boundary layer at an air–water interface is studied both experimentally and numerically. The objective is to relate variations in the surface temperature field to the hydrodynamics of the vortex pair below. The existence of a thermal boundary layer on the water side of an air–water interface is well known; it is this boundary layer which is disrupted by the action of the vortex system. Experimentally, the vortices were generated via the motion of a pair of submerged flaps. The flow was quantified through simultaneous measurement of both the subsurface velocity field, via digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), and the surface temperature field, via an infrared (IR) sensitive imager. The results of the physical experiments show a clearly defined disruption of the ambient thermal boundary layer which is well correlated with the vorticity field below. Numerical experiments were …",33
The effect of interpolation errors on the Lagrangian analysis of simulated turbulent channel flow,"Amy L Rovelstad, Robert A Handler, Peter S Bernard",1994/1,Journal Journal of Computational Physics,"A principal difficulty with Lagrangian calculations is the error associated with interpolation of the particle positions and velocities. Accurate interpolation is required in order to correctly follow particle paths as well as to secure useful predictions of the velocity derivatives, vorticity, and other higher order quantities along the trajectories. The accuracy of an interpolation scheme is determined by its ability to resolve the smallest scales in the flow. A parameter which has been found useful in this regard is kappa (sub max) eta, where kappa (sub max) is the largest resolved wavenumber, and eta is the Kolmogorov length scale. Prior studies of the interpolation errors associated with Lagrangian statistics have concentrated on isotropic flows where it was possible to maintain kappa (sub max) eta less than 1. The effect of interpolation error on the statistics in wall-bounded and other engineering flows where kappa (sub max …",33
The thermal signature of a low Reynolds number submerged turbulent jet impacting a free surface,"K Peter Judd, Geoffrey B Smith, Robert A Handler, Ankur Sisodia",2008/11/10,Journal Physics of Fluids,"The thermal signature of a low Reynolds number turbulent jet impacting a free surface was investigated experimentally. Three Reynolds numbers (1000, 3000, and 4800) were investigated for a configuration in which the jet nozzle diameter and the depth of the jet beneath the free surface were fixed. A high resolution infrared detector was used to collect thermal imagery of the surface temperature field. These data were then used to examine the detailed statistical nature of the resulting coupled thermal-hydrodynamic field. The analysis included an examination of the instantaneous, mean, and fluctuating surface thermal fields. Examination of the instantaneous fields strongly suggested the existence of a turbulent core region and a weaker outer region. The existence of this inner-outer structure associated with the surface flow was confirmed by a detailed examination of the mean surface temperature fields. In addition …",29
Transport at the air-sea interface,"Christoph S Garbe, Robert A Handler, Bernd Jähne",2007,Publisher Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag Berlin,"The sea surface represents the interface between the ocean and the atmosphere. As the interface is approached from either the atmospheric or ocean side, the transport mechanisms are shifted from turbulent to diffusive diffusion. Hence the viscous boundary layers at both sides of the water surface represents the major resistance to the transport of energy, mass and impulse between atmosphere and ocean. This has implications for the composition of the atmosphere and has gained importance especially for radiatively (climate)-active gases such as CO2, CH4, N2O and DMS. But also, the transport of gases across the interface is significant for the fate and the atmospheric/marine budgets of many man-made pollutants, in particular of volatile organic compounds and mercury.",29
Karhunen–Loeve representations of turbulent channel flows using the method of snapshots,"RA Handler, KD Housiadas, AN Beris",2006/12/30,Journal International journal for numerical methods in fluids,"For three‐dimensional flows with one inhomogeneous spatial coordinate and two periodic directions, the Karhunen–Loeve procedure is typically formulated as a spatial eigenvalue problem. This is normally referred to as the direct method (DM). Here we derive an equivalent formulation in which the eigenvalue problem is formulated in the temporal coordinate. It is shown that this so‐called method of snapshots (MOS) has some numerical advantages when compared to the DM. In particular, the MOS can be formulated purely as a matrix composed of scalars, thus avoiding the need to construct a matrix of matrices as in the DM. In addition, the MOS avoids the need for so‐called weight functions, which emerge in the DM as a result of the non‐uniform grid typically employed in the inhomogeneous direction. The avoidance of such weight functions, which may exhibit singular behaviour, guarantees satisfaction of the …",29
Interaction of vorticity with a free surface in turbulent open channel flow,"R Leighton, T SWEAN, JR, R Handler, J Swearingen",1991,Book 29th Aerospace Sciences Meeting,"The interaction between vorticity and a free surface, modeled as a shear free boundary is studied using a direct numerical simulation of an open channel flow at low Reynolds number (Ref,= UJ, h/w= 2340 where h is the channel depth and UJ. is the mean freesurface velocity). As a result of the shear free nature of the top boundary. only normal vorticity may terminate on it. The vorticity components parallel to the top boundary must go to zero as the boundary is approached. The time averaged fluctuating enstrophy balance equations, which are an indicator of!. he level of activity of the vorticity field are evaluated. Near the free surface the rate of production and destruction of enstrophy is set by the stretching and rotation of fluctuating vorticity by the fluctuating velocity field. The transport of enstrophy by the fluctuating velocity has a minor role. Of the the production terms, the three involving the stretching of vorticity along …",28
Characteristic time scales for predicting the scalar flux at a free surface in turbulent open‐channel flows,"Ryuichi Nagaosa, Robert A Handler",2012/12,Journal AIChE Journal,The purpose of this study is to predict the turbulent scalar flux at a free surface subject to a fully developed turbulent flow based on a hydrodynamic analysis of turbulence in the region close to the free surface. The effect of the Reynolds number on turbulent scalar transfer mechanisms is extensively examined. A direct numerical simulation technique is applied to achieve the purpose. The surface‐renewal approximation is used to correlate the free‐surface hydrodynamics and scalar transport at the free surface. Two types of characteristic time scales have been examined for predicting turbulent scalar flux. One is the time scale derived from the characteristic length and velocity scale at the free surface. The other is the reciprocal of the root‐mean‐square surface divergence. The results of this study show that scalar transport at the free surface can be predicted successfully using these time scales based on the concept …,27

Energy dynamics in a turbulent channel flow using the Karhunen‐Loéve approach,"GA Webber, RA Handler, L Sirovich",2002/12/20,Journal International journal for numerical methods in fluids,"The dynamical equations for the energy in a turbulent channel flow have been developed by using the Karhunen‐Loéve modes to represent the velocity field. The energy balance equations show that all the energy in the flow originates from the applied pressure gradient acting on the mean flow. Energy redistribution occurs through triad interactions, which is basic to understanding the dynamics. Each triad interaction determines the rate of energy transport between source and sink modes via a catalyst mode. The importance of the proposed method stems from the fact that it can be used to determine both the rate of energy transport between modes as well as the direction of energy flow. The effectiveness of the method in determining the mechanisms by which the turbulence sustains itself is demonstrated by performing a detailed analysis of triad interactions occurring during a turbulent burst in a minimal channel …",25
Examination of wall damping for the k‐ε turbulence model using direct simulations of turbulent channel flow,"E Wade Miner, Thomas F Swean Jr, Robert A Handler, Richard I Leighton",1991/4/20,Journal International journal for numerical methods in fluids,"Handler, Hendricks and Leighton have recently reported results for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow at moderate Reynolds number. These data are used to evaluate the terms in the exact and modelled transport equations for the turbulence kinetic energy k and the isotropic dissipation function ε. Both modelled transport equations show significant imbalances in the high‐shear region near the channel walls. The model for the eddy viscosity is found to yield distributions for the production terms which do not agree well with the distributions calculated from the DNS data. The source of the imbalance is attributed to the wall‐damping function required in eddy viscosity models for turbulent flows near walls. Several models for the damping function are examined, and it is found that the models do not vary across the channel as does the damping when evaluated from the DNS data. The Lam …",25

Statistics of the temperature and its derivatives at the surface of a wind‐driven air‐water interface,"Robert A Handler, Geoffrey B Smith",2011/6,Journal Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans,"The statistics of the temperature and its spatial derivatives at a wind‐driven air‐water interface were obtained from a comprehensive data set of high resolution infrared imagery for wind speeds ranging from 2 ms−1 to 10 ms−1. We focus our effort on considerations of the anisotropy, symmetry, and intermittency of the surface turbulence. The analysis reveals that the root‐mean‐square surface temperature, when made nondimensional by using the surface heat flux and friction velocity, is nearly independent of Richardson number (Ri, defined in section 2). In addition, the derivatives of the thermal field appear also to converge to a limiting value at low Ri. The skewness of the temperature field, though slightly positive for the lowest wind speed (2 ms−1), is otherwise negative. On the other hand, the skewness of the derivative of the temperature field in the along‐wind direction is strictly positive, while the skewness in the …",21
Capillary wave gas exchange in the presence of surfactants,"JR Saylor, RA Handler",1999/9,Journal Experiments in Fluids," The effect of surfactants on gas exchange across an air/water interface populated with capillary waves, is considered. Experiments were conducted on capillary waves having a wavelength of 2.87 mm in the presence of oleyl alcohol and stearic acid, as well as on surfaces which were surfactant-free. The presence of these surfactants decreased the gas exchange rate by at most a factor of two when the energy delivered to the tank was held constant. Thus, even in the presence of surfactants, pure capillary waves still caused significant gas exchange, indicating that partially damped capillary waves may play an important role in air/sea gas exchange. When the gas exchange coefficient was plotted as a function of mean square slope, the presence of surfactants was found to negligibly affect the gas exchange rate, with the possible exception of the high wave slope regime for stearic acid. This result suggests …",21
Infrared imagery of streak formation in a breaking wave,"Robert A Handler, Ivan Savelyev, Michael Lindsey",2012/12/5,Journal Physics of Fluids,"High resolution infrared imagery of breaking waves in a wave-tank free of wind shear or current reveals the production of a “streaky,” quasi-periodic thermal pattern produced during the breaking process. The streaks, or elongated patterns of warm and cold fluid, are found to form only when surface turbulence is present before wave breaking occurs. This suggests that wave-turbulence interaction is one mechanism that can lead to streak formation in breaking wave systems. More specifically, the streaky structures observed in these experiments may be caused by an intense, rapid tilting, and stretching of pre-existing vertical vorticity by the Stokes drift generated at or near the breaking wave crests, thereby generating a coherent system of counter-rotating vortices. We attempt to relate our observations to the recent theory of Teixeira and Belcher [J. Fluid Mech. 458, 229–267 (2002)10.1017/S0022112002007838]. Some …",20
Velocity and conformation statistics based on reduced Karhunen–Loeve projection data from DNS of viscoelastic turbulent channel flow,"Gaurab Samanta, Antony N Beris, Robert A Handler, Kostas D Housiadas",2009/7/1,Journal Journal of non-newtonian fluid mechanics,"To investigate the effectiveness of the Karhunen–Loeve (K–L) method as a data reduction approach, we study here its effect on the velocity and conformation statistics in a drag reducing turbulent polymer flow. The K–L method has been used to construct a set of basis velocity eigenfunctions from a large number of independent realizations of the velocity. Those were obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a viscoelastic turbulent channel flow using the Giesekus model. A subset of the K–L eigenfunctions, large enough to contain more than 90% of the fluctuating kinetic energy of the flow on the average, has then been subsequently used to obtain time series of projection coefficients of the velocity fields generated further from DNS. In a post-processing step, velocity fields were reconstructed using selected subsets of the projection coefficients. Those reconstructed velocity fields were then used to evaluate …",19
Wavelet analysis of the surface temperature field at an air–water interface subject to moderate wind stress,"Nicholas V Scott, Robert A Handler, Geoffrey B Smith",2008/8/1,Journal International journal of heat and fluid flow,"A new analysis methodology based on the wavelet transform is used to estimate the cross-wind scale statistics of high surface temperature events from two-dimensional infrared imagery. The method is applied to laboratory data obtained from an experiment conducted in 2001 at the University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science Air–sea Interaction Saltwater Tank (ASIST). For the case of positive heat flux, in which heat is transported from water to air and for all wind forcing conditions, results from the analysis of infrared images show that the number of high temperature events, when scanned in the cross-wind direction, occupies a wide range of scales. For all wind cases, at a low temperature fluctuation threshold, the number of high temperature events increases with increasing wavenumber (decreasing scale). As the temperature fluctuation threshold is increased, this distribution …",18
Time-evolution K–L analysis of coherent structures based on DNS of turbulent Newtonian and viscoelastic flows,"Gaurab Samanta, Geoffrey M Oxberry, Antony N Beris, Robert A Handler, Kostas D Housiadas",2008/1/1,Journal Journal of Turbulence,"The turbulent dynamics corresponding to direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of Newtonian and viscoelastic turbulent channel flows is analyzed here through a projection of a time sequence of velocity fields into a set of Karhunen–Loeve (K–L) modes, large enough to contain, on the average, more than 90% of the fluctuating turbulence kinetic energy. Previous calculations of the K–L eigenstructure have demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the K–L dimensionality accompanying the presence of viscoelasticity in turbulent channel flows. Projection of turbulent velocity information into the most energetic K–L modes allows for a significant data reduction, most suitable for the study of the time-evolution dynamics. We exploit this feature here in analyzing the time series of the projection coefficients of the velocity field into K–L modes to gain further quantitative insights into the behavior of the overall flow dynamics.

Convergence fronts in tidally forced rotating estuaries,"Robert A Handler, Richard P Mied, Thomas E Evans, Timothy F Donato",2001/11/15,Journal Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans,"In situ observation and remote sensing imagery reveal the presence of longitudinal velocity convergences over bathymetric channels in tidal estuaries. We present the results of numerical experiments designed to investigate the cause of these convergences for channels possessing shallow shoal regions and a deeper central region. The equations of motion for a homogeneous fluid on a rotating Earth are solved using a fully spectral code in the across‐estuary (i.e., the vertical or x‐z) plane, while no along‐estuary flow variations (in the y direction) are permitted. A Gaussian‐shaped bottom bathymetry is chosen. In the along‐channel (y) direction we impose a pressure gradient which is the sum of constant and fluctuating parts to simulate the steady and tidally oscillating parts of the estuarine flow. The details of the transient response can be complicated, but we observe that for most (∼80%) of the tidal cycle there …",17
Observations of the structure of the surface temperature field at an air-water interface for stable and unstable cases,"Geoffrey B Smith, Robert A Handler, Nicholas Scott",2007,"Journal Transport at the Air-Sea Interface: Measurements, Models and Parametrizations","The thermal structure of an air-water interface is investigated by examining thermal imagery obtained from a high resolution infrared (IR) sensor. The experiments were performed at the ASIST facility at the University of Miami for wind speeds ranging from approximately 2 ms−1 to 10 ms−1 and for flux based Richardson numbers ranging from about 10−2 to 10−5. Two cases were examined: (1) the so-called cool-skin case where the water surface was significantly cooler than the bulk water temperature and (2) the warm-skin case where the water surface was warmer than the bulk. In the cool-skin case, the low wind speed results reveal a cellular structure reminiscent of earlier results in which the lateral length scale of the cells (or fish-scales) varies as the inverse of the friction velocity. The imagery clearly reveals the progression from non-breaking gravity waves, to a system of omnidirectional breaking which …",16
The thermal structure of a wind-driven Reynolds ridge,"Supathorn Phongikaroon, K Peter Judd, Geoffrey B Smith, Robert A Handler",2004/8,Journal Experiments in fluids,"In this study, we investigate the nature of a Reynolds ridge formed by wind shear. We have simultaneously imaged the water surface, with a deposit of a monolayer of the surfactant, oleyl alcohol, subject to different wind shears, by using a high-resolution infrared (IR) detector and a high-speed (HS) digital camera. The results reveal that the regions around the wind-driven Reynolds ridge, which have subtle manifestations in visual imagery, possess surprisingly complex hydrodynamical and thermal structures when observed in the infrared. The IR measurements reveal a warm, clean region upstream of the ridge, which is composed of the so called fishscale structures observed in earlier investigations.

Note on the cancellation of contaminating noise in the measurement of turbulent wall pressure fluctuations,"MP Home, RA Handler",1991/12,Journal Experiments in fluids,"A method is presented for the cancellation of wide band contaminating noise occurring within internal flow configurations such as rectangular channels and pipes. Facility generated noise within these flow systems contaminates the turbulent wall pressure signature at low frequencies thus preventing the possible extraction of useful information. The proposed methodology utilizes the signals from two flush mounted wall pressure transducers. A first estimate for the one-point spectral density is obtained using a least mean square algorithm. A secondary correction to this estimate is obtained by taking advantage of the planar homogeneity of the turbulence. The application of the technique is demonstrated in a fully developed turbulent channel flow for which a more than 40 dB cancellation is obtained at low frequencies. In this low frequency range, the power spectral density is shown to have an approximate …",15
An evaluation of gas transfer velocity parameterizations during natural convection using DNS,"Sam T Fredriksson, Lars Arneborg, Håkan Nilsson, Qi Zhang, Robert A Handler",2016/2,Journal Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans,"Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of free surface flows driven by natural convection are used to evaluate different methods of estimating air‐water gas exchange at no‐wind conditions. These methods estimate the transfer velocity as a function of either the horizontal flow divergence at the surface, the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation beneath the surface, the heat flux through the surface, or the wind speed above the surface. The gas transfer is modeled via a passive scalar. The Schmidt number dependence is studied for Schmidt numbers of 7, 150 and 600. The methods using divergence, dissipation and heat flux estimate the transfer velocity well for a range of varying surface heat flux values, and domain depths. The two evaluated empirical methods using wind (in the limit of no wind) give reasonable estimates of the transfer velocity, depending however on the surface heat flux and surfactant saturation.

In the viscoelastic case, the Giesekus model is used at a friction Weissenberg number 50, a mobility parameter 1/900, and viscosity ratio 0.9, corresponding to 37.4% drag reduction. The skewness and the flatness factors, which are also calculated and presented as functions of the distance from the wall, further reveal and quantify the non-Gaussian characteristics of the turbulent structures and how they are distributed in the flow domain. With the presence of viscoelasticity the non-Gaussian character of the PDFs is typically further enhanced. In particular, larger asymmetries and much longer …",14

The simulations, which were performed with a Rayleigh number of  and a maximal polymeric extension of L = 100, show that the wall heat flux is reduced by about 28% at a Weissenberg number of 20, which is in reasonable agreement with the results obtained in Rayleigh-Benard turbulence.

Direct numerical simulation of turbulent free convection in the presence of a surfactant,"Qi Zhang, Robert A Handler, Sam T Fredriksson",2013/6/1,Journal International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,"The effects of surfactants on the turbulent flow of a liquid cooled from above and driven by buoyant convection, are explored using direct numerical simulations. The limiting case of zero surface stress and an insoluble surfactant is investigated. It is found that relatively small amounts of surfactant can have a significant effect on the flow, and that these effects can be accounted for by using a turbulence–surfactant interaction number, which expresses the ratio of surface elastic forces to inertial forces. Emphasis in this work is placed on the effects of surfactants on heat transfer, and the structure of the surface temperature field. As surface elasticity is increased, the surface temperature is found to decrease, the thermal boundary layer thickness is found to increase, and the Nusselt number based on the domain depth is found to decrease by as much as 43%.

On the role of accelerating fluid particles in the generation of Reynolds stress,"Robert A Handler, Peter S Bernard, Amy L Rovelstad, Jerry D Swearingen",1992/6,Journal Physics of Fluids A: Fluid Dynamics,The connection between Reynolds stress and the kinematical and dynamical processes associated with streamwise fluid particle accelerations in the near‐wall region of a fully developed channel flow is investigated. Visualizations of the particle paths contributing most significantly to Reynolds stress via such accelerations show them to be linked with spiraling motions in the cores of vortical structures tilted in the streamwise direction. This contrasts with the action of vortices in sweep and ejection events in which transport occurs through the displacement of fluid particles. A conceptual model for Reynolds stress generation by acceleration transport is suggested and the relative importance of pressure and viscous forces is computed. It is found that viscous forces play the dominant role until y+≳40 at which point pressure forces become most significant.,13
Dynamical significance of turbulent wall layer streaks,"PS Bernard, RA Handler",1990/5/1,Volume 43,"The role of low speed streaks in the dynamical processes leading to the generation of Reynolds stress is investigated using ensembles of computed particle paths obtained from a direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow. Simultaneous visualization of appropriate Eulerian fields and trajectories of fluid particles which are most indicative of Reynolds stress production are given. These graphically illustrate the occurrence of ejection events at a series of discrete locations along low speed streaks. A strong association between streamwise vortices and the ejecting fluid is found. In particular, visualization of the ejecting fluid shows the presence of vortices which drive fluid from the sides up and over the low speed regions. As part of this process fluid from within the streaks appears to be entrained outward from the wall. Some of the implications of these results for turbulence modeling will be described.",13
Regions of estuarine convergence at high Rossby number: A solution in estuaries with elliptical cross sections,"Richard P Mied, Robert A Handler, Timothy F Donato",2002/11,Journal Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans,"Generation of convergence regions in homogeneous rotating rectilinear estuaries is addressed. The mechanism investigated is the tilting of the planetary vorticity by the vertical shear of the along‐estuary flow, which can result in rapidly growing surface convergence regions aligned along the axis of the estuary. The complexity introduced by the bathymetry geometry and the nonlinearity of the equations has resulted in computationally intensive numerical solutions to this problem [Mied et al., 2000; Handler et al., 2001]. However, an analytical solution that will allow the study of varying parameters and the observation of general trends is possible with a judicious choice of bottom bathymetry and appropriate analytical simplifications.

The interface and near-surface flow were examined using optical high-speed (HS) motion analysis, infrared (IR) imagery, and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). IR imagery revealed an instability in the form of thermal scars on the expanding circular surfactant front. The nature of this instability was explored by performing experiments with both clean and contaminated surfaces. LIF visualization techniques were used to gain insight into the nature of the near-surface flow field. This revealed the presence of a vortex ring that underwent an instability in which ringlets surrounded the primary core.

The length scale results indicate that a typical eddy is flattened as it interacts with the surface. The scales as-sociated with the vertical component of velocity seem to determine the extent of the source layer described in the Hunt-Graham model. The energy spectra show qualitative agreement with the model, though higher resolutioncalculations will be required to malie more quantitative comparisons. Additionally, the proximity of the free surface to the bottom solid wall of the channel evidences itself as a wall-layer streaky structure which persists to a noticeably greater distance away from the wall.

Augmented surface Nusselt numbers are measured for sucrose-based, viscoelastic solutions with polyacrylamide (as they are subject to different magnitudes of flow strain), relative to Newtonian flows and relative to fluids with zero shear rate. The resulting Nusselt number enhancements are related to the experimental conditions that are believed to be associated with the onset and development of elastic instabilities.

These dynamics also play an important role in the determination of the interfacial flux of heat, mass, and momentum at the air-sea interface. Here we present results of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of an undeformed interface subject to a constant shear and constant outgoing heat flux at three Reynolds numbers. Particular attention is payed to the surface temperature field and its relation to the velocity and vorticity fields.

Evolution of a hairpin vortex in a shear-thinning fluid governed by a power-law model,"Ni Zhen, Robert A Handler, Qi Zhang, Cassandra Oeth",2013/10/10,Journal Physics of Fluids,"The effect of a shear-thinning fluid governed by a power-law model on the evolution of a hairpin vortex in a wall-bounded flow was studied by means of direct numerical simulation. With a fixed Reynolds number and hairpin vortex strength, the effect of shear-thinning on vortex evolution could be isolated. The primary observation is that very early in time shear-thinning has the effect of reducing the production of vortex kinetic energy and dramatically increasing viscous dissipation. This leads to a delay in the transition of the flow to a turbulent state. Three-dimensional flow visualizations reveal that the increased dissipation is associated with an instability in which the hairpin vortex is broken down into small-scale structures. It is suggested that the finite amplitude of the hairpin creates a lowering of viscosity near the hairpin vortex core which leads to this instability.",8

Vortex generation in a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic Peterlin fluid initially at rest,"Robert A Handler, Estela Blaisten‐Barojas, Phillip M Ligrani, Pei Dong, Mikell Paige",2020/3,Journal Engineering Reports,"It is well known that the mixing of two or more species in flows at low Reynolds numbers cannot be easily achieved since inertial effects are essentially absent and molecular diffusion is slow. To achieve mixing in Newtonian fluids under these circumstances requires innovative new ideas such as the use of external body forces (eg, electromagnetic mixers) or the stretching and folding of fluid elements (eg, chaotic advection). For non‐Newtonian fluids with elasticity, mixing can be achieved by enabling the emergence of elastic instabilities that results in chaotic flows in which mixing is significantly enhanced. In this work, our goal is to demonstrate that clearly identifiable vortical structures (eg, vortex rings) can be generated in a viscoelastic fluid initially at rest by the release of elastic stresses. In turn, these vortex motions promote bulk mixing by transporting fluid elements from one location to another more efficiently …",6
Structural characterization of wind-sheared turbulent flow using self-organized mapping,"Nicholas V Scott, Robert A Handler",2016/5/17,Conference Ocean Sensing and Monitoring VIII,"A nonlinear cluster analysis algorithm is used to characterize the spatial structure of a wind-sheared turbulent flow obtained from the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the three-dimensional temperature and momentum fields.

Numerical simulation of the swirling flow of a finitely extensible non-linear elastic Peterlin fluid,"Krishna T Khambhampati, Robert A Handler",2020/10/1,Journal Physics of Fluids,"Viscoelastic fluids have been shown to undergo instabilities even at very low Reynolds numbers, and these instabilities can give rise to a phenomenon called elastic turbulence. This phenomenon, observed experimentally in viscoelastic polymer solutions, is driven by the strong coupling between the fluid velocity and the elasticity of the flow. To explore the emergence of these instabilities in a viscoelastic flow, we have chosen to explore, by means of direct numerical simulations, a particular case called von Kármán swirling flow.

Experiments in Drag-Reducing Polymer Flows,"EW Hendricks, JV Lawler, MP Horne, RA Handler, JD Swearingen",1989,Journal Advances in Fluid Mechanics Measurements,"Small amounts of high molecular weight polymers (a few parts per million by weight) dissolved in a solvent can reduce the turbulent flow frictional resistance from that of the pure solvent by as much as 90 percent.

The study of these drag-reducing, non-Newtonian fluid flows received initial impetus from the study of Toms (1948). Since this work, the examination of the turbulent flow properties of dilute solutions of long chain high-molecular weight polymers has generated many hundreds of publications, of which a majority are experimental investigations.

Turbulent wall pressure fluctuations over wavy surfaces,RA Handler,1990/10,Journal Experiments in fluids,"Measurements of the spectral characteristics of the wall pressure fluctuations produced by a turbulent boundary layer flow over solid sinusoidal surfaces of moderate wave amplitude to wave-length ratios have been obtained. The wave amplitudes were sufficiently small so that the flow remained attatched. The results show that the root mean square pressure level reaches a maximum on the adverse pressure gradient side of the wave at a position somewhat before the trough. Spectral analysis of the pressure fluctuations in narrow frequency bands reveals considerable differences in low and high frequency behavior. At low frequencies, the peak fluctuation amplitude was found at the trough whereas at high frequencies, the peak occurs just after the crest and a minimum is found at the trough.

Innovative Methodology for Cancelling Contaminating Noise in Turbulent Fluid Flow Environments,"Michael P Horne, Robert A Handler",1990/9/19,Publisher NAVAL RESEARCH LAB WASHINGTON DC,"A method is presented for the cancellation of wide band contaminating noise occurring within internal flow configurations such as rectangular channels and pipes. Facility generated noise within these flow systems contaminates the turbulent wall pressure signature at low frequencies thus preventing the possible extraction of useful information. The proposed methodology utilizes the signals from two flush mounted wall pressure transducers. A first estimate for the one and two-point spectral densities is obtained using a least mean square algorithm. A secondary correction to this estimate is obtained by taking advantage of the planar homogeneity of the turbulence. The application of the technique is demonstrated in a fully developed turbulent channel flow for which more than 40 dB cancellation is obtained at low frequencies. In this low frequency range, the power spectral density is shown to have an approximate quadratic dependence, substantiating past theoretical predictions reported in the literature. In addition, the two-point spectral densities are adequately resolved, substantiating a convective pattern which rapidly loses coherence which is typical in such flow configurations.

N Evaluation of the Near-Wall kE Turbulence O Model by Comparison with Direct Simulations of Turbulent Channel Flow,"E WADE MINER, TF Swean Jr, RA Handler, RI Leighton",1989/9/7,Journal NRL Memorandum Report,"During the past three decades the fluid dynamics community has focused much of its attention on the development of techniques and capabilities for the calculation of turbulent flow fields. Increases in available computational capabilities have permitted researchers to develop and test increasingly sophisticated and complete models for the numerical simulation of turbulent flows. The state of the art has reached a point where direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows at low-to-moderate Reynolds numbers are feasible. Such work has been reported in several studies including those by Kim, Moin and Moser (1987) and Handler, Hendricks and Leighton (1989), hereinafter referred to as KMM and HHL, respectively. In these simulations, the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically. All essential scales of the turbulent flow are resolved and no subgrid modeling of the turbulence is employed. Such calculations, however, are feasible only for research purposes, and calculations of turbulent flows for engineering purposes utilize the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations coupled with some level of turbulence modeling.",2
"Numerical simulation and linearized theory of vortex waves in a viscoelastic, polymeric fluid","Robert A Handler, Michael J Buckingham",2021/9/9,Journal Fluids,"In a high viscosity, polymeric fluid initially at rest, the release of elastic energy produces vorticity in the form of coherent motions (vortex rings). Such behavior may enhance mixing in the low Reynolds number flows encountered in microfluidic applications. In this work, we develop a theory for such flows by linearizing the governing equations of motion. The linear theory predicts that when elastic energy is released in a symmetric manner, a wave of vorticity is produced with two distinct periods of wave motion: (1) a period of wave expansion and growth extending over a transition time scale, followed by (2) a period of wave translation and viscous decay. The vortex wave speeds are predicted to be proportional to the square root of the initial fluid tension, and the fluid tension itself scales as the viscosity. Besides verifying the predictions of the linearized theory, numerical solutions of the equations of motion for the velocity field, obtained using a pseudo-spectral method, show that the flow is composed of right- and left-traveling columnar vortex pairs, called vortex waves for short. Wave speeds obtained from the numerical simulations are within 1.5% of those from the linear theory when the assumption of linearity holds. Vortex waves are found to decay on a time scale of the order of the vortex size divided by the solution viscosity, in reasonable agreement with the analytical solution of the linearized model for damped vortex waves. When the viscoelastic fluid is governed by a nonlinear spring model, as represented by the Peterlin function, wave speeds are found to be larger than the predictions of the linear theory for small polymer extension lengths.",1

Numerical Solution of the Radiation Transport Equation at an Air-Water Interface for a Stratified Medium,"K Peter Judd, Robert A Handler",2019/2/18,Journal Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering,"This paper is a continuation of previous work that analytically examined the strength of radiation leaving an air-water interface. The approach here is to numerically integrate the radiation transport equation in order to capture the non-linear features of the problem, and also to include more realistic models for the thermal boundary layer. The radiation intensity of the photons emitted from the interface, relative to that of thermal radiation at the temperature of the interface, is defined here as the signal. This signal was computed for constant surface temperature and constant heat flux boundary conditions. As expected, the numerical computations show that the signal increased as the air-water temperature difference increased. The results are shown to form a hierarchy of signal strengths based on the chosen thermal stratification model. However, for both boundary conditions, the numerical results for a linear temperature profile compared very favorably with the simplified analytical linearized model over the thermal wavebands of 3–5 and 8–14 microns. In addition, the linearized model compared favorably with the most realistic models of thermal stratification.",1
Analysis of infrared radiation at an air-water interface,"Robert A Handler, K Peter Judd",2018/5/8,Journal Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering,"The problem of determining the strength of the infrared radiation from an air-water interface has been addressed analytically. The approach taken here is to express the Planck spectrum as a linear function of the temperature, an approximation valid for small variations of the temperature from the surface temperature, and to assume a linear temperature profile across the thermal boundary layer. The main result shows that the deviation of the surface radiation intensity from the Planck spectrum due solely to thermal stratification, is linearly proportional to the temperature change across the thermal boundary layer and the optical depth, but is inversely proportional to the thermal boundary layer thickness. This signal was shown to be about one order of magnitude greater than the noise level expected from modern CCD IR sensors at a wavelength of about 3.8 μm. It is suggested that controlled laboratory experiments be conducted to verify these theoretical estimates.",1

Active suppression of buoyancy driven turbulence,"Qi Zhang, Robert A Handler",2014/8/1,Journal International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,"The aqueous turbulent layer at the air–sea interface plays an important role in determining interfacial fluxes. Here a method of determining the heat flux at such an interface is explored by simulating the effects of surface heating on the evolution of buoyancy driven turbulence. We find that the turbulence can be almost entirely eliminated when the source is of sufficient strength, depth, and duration. As the fluid cools, it is found to undergo an abrupt transition to turbulence which corresponds to a signature in the surface temperature. A simple one-dimensional conduction model is found to accurately describe the temporal response of the surface temperature during heating and cooling.",1
Applications of direct numerical simulations to interfacial problems,Robert A Handler,2012/7/22,Conference 2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium,"The fluid mechanics associated with the interface between two fluids, and in particular air and water, is of obvious importance in applications such as remote sensing, and the characterization of the environment. In remote sensing applications interfacial dynamics play a role in determining signatures in the radar, infrared, and visible wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. These dynamics also play an important role in the determination of the interfacial flux of heat, mass, and momentum at the air-sea interface. In particular, accurate estimation of carbon dioxide flux and aerosol production has a direct bearing on our ability to predict climate change.

The concept of the surface-renewal approximation (Dankwerts, 1951) is introduced in this study to establish the predictive models for the interfacial scalar flux. Turbulent flow realizations obtained by a direct numerical simulation technique are employed to prepare details of three-dimensional information on turbulence in the region very close to the interface. Two characteristic time scales at the interface have been examined for exact prediction of the scalar transfer flux. One is the time scale which is reciprocal of the root-mean-square surface divergence, T γ=⟨ γγ⟩− 1/2, where γ is the surface divergence.

The ability to quantify such characteristics is vital to determining the complex nature of heat transport, gas entrainment and momentum exchange across air-water interfaces. These physical processes play an important role in determining global climate and their accurate description is necessary for consistent weather modeling.

Implications of Lagrangian Transport Analysis for Large Eddy Simulations,"Amy L Rovelstad, Robert A Handler, PS Bernard",1993/6,Journal ASME-PUBLICATIONS-FED,"It is common practice to formulate large eddy sim-ulations via spatial filtering of the Navier-Stokes equa-tion in which the effect of the smaller, unresolved scales appears as the subgrid-scale (SGS) Reynolds stress, Tij= U; U;–ūjūj. Here, a bar denotes a filtered quan-tity, and wi is the ith component of the velocity. The subgrid stress is typically assumed to arise from diffusive transport which can be described by the Smagorinsky eddy viscosity model. Weaknesses in this approach have emerged in the course of its application, which has motivated the search for improvements (Germano, et al 1991). The present work is concerned with the develop-ment and testing of new subgrid models suggested by recent studies of the physical mechanisms behind mo-mentum and vorticity transport (Bernard 1990, Rovel-stad 1991, Bernard & Handler 1990). In particular, La-grangian analysis of the physics of vorticity transport, including the effects of vortex stretching and shearing, has led to a derivation of a model for the Reynolds av-a eraged vorticity flux correlations, and which produces an impetus for pursuing the development of a spatially filtered subgrid vorticity transport model. As in the case of the Smagorinsky SGS model, it is possible to formulate such a subgrid vorticity transport model by generalizing from the Reynolds averaged case. The remainder of this paper will present the development and a priori testing of a vorticity based subgrid",1
Propagating structures in wall-bounded turbulent flows,"L Sirovich, KS Ball, RA Handler",1991/8,Journal Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics,The Karhunen—Loève procedure is used to analyze two turbulent channel flow simulations. In both instances this reveals the presence of propagating plane wave structures in the turbulent flows. These waves appear to play an essential role in the local production of turbulence via bursting or sweeping events. The envelope of the propagating modes propagates with a speed which is equal to the mean velocity at the locus of maximal average Reynolds stress. Despite marked differences between the two flows similar results are obtained from each simulation. This is suggestive of the existence of universal or near universal features in the turbulent boundary layer. An analogy with critical layer mechanisms of transitional flows is discussed.,88

Wavenumber-Frequency Structure of Turbulent Flow in a Channel from a Direct Simulation.,RA Handler,1987/11/30,Publisher NAVAL RESEARCH LAB WASHINGTON DC,"The detailed wavenumber frequency structure of the streamwise and wall normal components of the turbulent velocity has been obtained from a direct simulation in a channel. The turbulence is in an early stage of development but the features of the flow are qualitatively similar to the structure of fully developed turbulence. It is found from spectra computed in horizontal planes that wave speeds very near the wall are significantly higher than the local mean velocity and that the near wall streamwise velocity spectra exhibit a periodic structure. The spanwise length scale of this structure appears to correspond with the well known streak spacing observed in experiments. Detailed results of the wall pressure field reveal features which correspond closely with experiments in fully developed turbulence. Along with spectra obtained in the horizontal plane, the dependence of the correlations of wall-normal component of the turbulence on distance from the wall is presented. These correlations are directly related to a dominant source of wall pressure fluctuations.",1

Near-surface physics during convection affecting air-water gas transfer,"ST Fredriksson, L Arneborg, H Nilsson, RA Handler",2016/5/1,Journal IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,"The gas flux at the water surface is affected by physical processes including turbulence from wind shear, microscale wave breaking, large-scale breaking, and convection due to heat loss at the surface. The main route in the parameterizations of the gas flux has been to use the wind speed as a proxy for the gas flux velocity, indirectly taking into account the dependency of the wind shear and the wave processes. The interest in the contributions from convection processes has increased as the gas flux from inland waters (with typically lower wind and sheltered conditions) now is believed to play a substantial role in the air-water gas flux budget.

Generation of the maximum breaking wave amplitude by means of unidirectional wave focusing,"Ivan Savelyev, Robert Handler",2010/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"This work overviews existing methods and proposes new approach for the wave breaking generation in wave tanks.

In this work, frequency modulated packets were generated by means of a single flat paddle hinged at the bottom. Two methods proposed within our approach reveal strong nonlinear wave envelope modulation in high amplitude regimes. Wave packets with high steepness were found to deviate from linear expectations by shifting their energy towards the leading edge. If left uncorrected, such modulation leads to defocusing of the wave energy, causing breaking waves to be less energetic and to appear prior to the desired location.

Methods to Approach Velocity Data Reduction and Their Effects on Conformation Statistics in Viscoelastic Turbulent Channel Flows,"Gaurab Samanta, Antony Beris, Robert Handler, Kostas Housiadas",2009/3,Journal APS March Meeting Abstracts,"Karhunen-Loeve (KL) analysis of DNS data of viscoelastic turbulent channel flows helps us to reveal more information on the time-dependent dynamics of viscoelastic modification of turbulence [Samanta et. al., J.

Previous static K‐L analyses have demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the K‐L dimensionality (and, correspondingly, the number of modes caπying most of the turbulent energy) as viscoelasticity increases in turbulent channel flows; this is also consistent to the increasing importance of large coherent structures for viscoelastic turbulent flows, as was also revealed in previous flow visualizations of DNS data.

Systematic Velocity Data Reduction and Its Effect on Polymer Conformation Statistics in Viscoelastic Turbulent Channel Flows,"Gaurab Samanta, Antony N Beris, D Housiadas Kostas, Robert A Handler",2008,Journal The 2008 Annual Meeting,"Previously, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of viscoelastic turbulent channel flows have been successfully used to demonstrate drag reduction [1]. This led us to explore ways to extract dynamic information of large scale structures (coherent structures) hidden into petabytes of data generated by typical DNS runs as these structures help to reveal turbulence intermittency. In this regard, we made use of the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) decomposition technique, applied only to the velocity field, which allowed us a systematic way to truncate velocity information, and carried out a comparative study of Newtonian and viscoelastic turbulent channel flows, investigating time series data of high energy KL modes via correlation (auto and cross) calculations [2]. However, the polymer conformation has a major role to play in the drag reduction mechanism [1] and it is essential to investigate the effects of velocity data reduction on conformation statistics. So, we calculate here the viscoelastic conformation field developed in response to the velocity field reconstructed from selected KL representations and compare the results against the full DNS predictions. We also independently truncate the velocity information represented in a Fourier-Chebyshev series in a DNS and study its response on the polymer conformation. The relevance of these results in building low dimensional models for viscoelastic turbulence will be addressed.",
Dynamic K‐L analysis of coherent structures based on DNS of turbulent Newtonian and viscoelastic flows,"Gaurab Samanta, Geoffrey Oxberry, Antony N Beris, Robert Handler, Kostas Housiadas",2007/12,Journal PAMM: Proceedings in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,"Earlier work [1, 2], using Karhunen‐Loeve (K‐L) analysis, demonstrated a dramatic enhancement of the importance of large scale motions with increased viscoelasticity and an equally dramatic decrease in the K‐L dimension of the flow (an order of magnitude) as viscoelasticity increases versus similar Newtonian results. In this work we look into dynamics of viscoelastic turbulent flows by projecting the DNS data in time into a selected set of K‐L modes. The dynamics of the coherent structures embedded in turbulent flows were investigated through calculations of mode auto and cross correlations. This allows for a more systematic examination of the role of large‐scale structures in turbulence and drag reduction. (© 2008 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)",
Dynamic KL Analysis of Turbulent Channel Flows,"Gaurab Samanta, Antony N Beris, Robert A Handler, Kostas D Housiadas",2007/11/6,Journal The 2007 Annual Meeting,"The turbulent dynamics corresponding to long-time Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data of Newtonian and viscoelastic turbulent channel flows is analyzed here through a projection of the velocity fields into a set of Karhunen-Loeve (KL) modes, large enough to contain, on the average, more than 90% of the fluctuating turbulence energy. Previous (*) static KL analyses have demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the KL dimensionality (and, correspondingly, the number of modes carrying most of the turbulent energy) as viscoelasticity increases in turbulent channel flows; this is also consistent to the increasing importance of large coherent structures for viscoelastic turbulent flows, as was also revealed in previous flow visualizations of DNS data.",
Observations of the surface temperature field at an air-water interface for both stable and unstable conditions,"Geoffrey Smith, Robert Handler, Nicholas Scott",2006/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"High-resolution infrared (IR) imagery of the air-water interface was obtained during experiments performed at the ASIST facility at the University of Miami. During the experiments wind speeds ranged from approximately 2 ms-1 to 10 ms-1, and flux based Richardson numbers ranged from about 10-2 to 10-5. Results from two regimes will be presented: the cool-skin case, where the water surface temperature is less than the bulk fluid, and the warm-skin case, where the water surface is warmer than the bulk. In the cool skin case the low wind speed data show a cellular structure in which the lateral length scale of the cells varies as the inverse of the friction velocity. The imagery clearly shows a progression from no waves, through non-breaking gravity waves, to a system of seemingly omnidirectional breaking events. In the warm-skin case the dominant cellular structure is still present, strongly suggesting that these small …",
The Thermal Structure of a Near Surface Developing Turbulent Jet on Clean and Contaminated Free-surfaces,"K Peter Judd, Geoffrey B Smith",2005/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"The thermal structure of a near surface turbulent submerged round liquid jet on clean and contaminated free-surfaces was investigated experimentally for several Reynolds numbers and depth to nozzle diameter ratios (h/d). The objective of this investigation is to shed light on the interaction and morphology of near surface turbulent structures by examining their resulting thermal signatures. A gravity feed supplied the jet water, whose ambient temperature is slightly above that of the test facility. Thus the warmer fluid serves as a passive marker. Using high spatial and temporal resolution infrared imagery, thermal maps of the surface were generated. The detector, an IR CCD camera, was sensitive to radiation in the 3-5 micron wavelength band with temperature sensitivity of 0.02 K.

Karhunen-Lo'eve analysis of coherent structures in viscoelastic turbulent channel flows,"Geoffrey Oxberry, Robert Handler, Kostas Housiadas",2005/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"Direct numerical simulation data of viscoelastic turbulent channel flows from Housiadas et al.(Phys. Fluids, 17: 035106, 2005) were analyzed by decomposing the dynamic velocity fields into representative time-invariant eigenfunctions using the Karhunen-Lo'eve technique. Eigenfunctions were evaluated previously as explained in the aforementioned article. The dominant eigenmodes of flows (ranked by energy) display a structure similar to definitions of turbulent vortices in the literature. Therefore, time-dependent analysis of the velocity field in terms of those eigenfunctions allows one to evaluate the long time behavior of large, coherent structures in the flow. The comparison of the viscoelastic data, obtained with the FENE-P model, against results obtained for Newtonian turbulent channel flow allows for a better understanding of the role of viscoelasticity in turbulence modification leading to drag reduction.",
High-Resolution Temperature and Velocity Measurements in a Wind-Wave Tunnel,"Supathorn Phongikaroon, K Peter Judd, Geoffrey B Smith, Robert A Handler",2004/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"An understanding of the relationship between temperature and velocity fields at an air-water interface is critical in developing quantitative and predictive models of air-sea transports. At low to moderate wind speeds, the air-water interface is composed of buoyant plumes that are stretched by the surface shear as they reach the interface (Handler et al. 2001). The goal is to develop a correlation between the streak spacing of these plumes and turbulence boundary layer characteristics, such as the surface drift velocity (u_s) and the friction velocity (u*). To accomplish this task, a high-resolution infrared (IR) imaging technique is used to capture the free surface temperature field while the subsurface velocity is measured by Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV).

The focus of this study is placed on development of a near-wall bursting eddy toward the free surface and its interaction with the free surface. Two statistical post-processing strategies are employed to predict development of the near-wall bursting eddy toward the free surface; one is the three-dimensional two-point correlation technique and the other is the ensemble averaging procedure. The emergence of a vortex ring in the region adjacent to the free surface is indicated successfully by the both two statistical analyses. The presence of the vortex ring in the subsurface region is also accesses by extensive observations of instantaneous turbulent flow realizations.

The effect of external shear stress on redistribution of turbulence kinetic energy at a gas-liquid interface,"Ryuichi Nagaosa, Robert A Handler",2001/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,The redistribution of the turbulence kinetic energy by pressure-strain transfer at an uniformly-sheared gas-liquid interface in a fully developed turbulence has been investigated using numerous turbulent flow realizations obtained by a direct numerical simulation. The effect of the interfacial shear on the pressure-strain transfer of the turbulence kinetic energy in the near-interface region is discussed by comparison of the results of the present study with that below an unsheared gas-liquid interface. The results of this study suggest that the interfacial shear alters drastically the mechanism of the transfer of the turbulence kinetic energy. The reduced turbulence kinetic energy in the interface-normal direction by the zero-permeable condition at the unsheared interface is transferred to the spanwise direction rather than the streamwise direction. The interfacial shear stress promotes the transfer of the turbulence kinetic energy …,
Surface elasticity effects in turbulent open channel flow,"Robert Handler, Richard Leighton, Geoffrey Smith, Ryuichi Nagaosa",2001/11,Journal APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,"A series of direct numerical simulations of fully developed open channel flow were performed. In each simulation the surface elasticity was changed starting from a clean surface and ending with a highly contaminated surface. We present here the detailed turbulence statistics which result from these simulations. It is shown that surfactants have a consistent and strong effect on the subsurface turbulence. At the highest surface elasticity, the turbulence is severely damped resulting in a lower surface temperature for a given constant heat flux. A simple nondimensional number which represents the ratio of elastic forces to inertial forces seems to describe quite well the transition between clean and contaminated interfaces. It is also observed that a relatively small surface elasticity can produce significant efffects on the near surface turbulence.",

These simulations generate enormous quantities of data which have been used to investigate the validity of current theories of turbulence, etc. However, before detailed investigations can be undertaken, it is important to first check some basic statistics of the turbulence such as the mean velocity profile, turbulence intensities, and Reynolds stress profiles, beyond these one-point statistics so that length and time scales of the turbulence can be determined. This report describes FORTRAN codes which enable rapid evaluation of the two point correlations from a given dataset. Computer codes have been developed which compute the space time correlations in turbulent channel flow. The two-point spatial correlation function is computed by Fourier transforming the appropriate wavenumber spectrum. The wavenumber spectrum is computed by averaging over an appropriate number of ensembles and using geometric symmetries to improve the smoothness of the results. Space-time correlations are computed in a similar manner. Keywords Symmetries Correlations.",
A Cancellation Technique for Reducing Background Noise Within Turbulent Flow Environments Characterized by Pipes and Annuli,"MP Horne, EW HENDRiCKS, RA Handler",1988/12/30,Publisher NAVAL RESEARCH LAB WASHINGTON DC,"Experimental studies of turbulent boundary layer wall pressure fluctuations are typically complicated by flow generated acoustic pressure levels which are superimposed on the turbulent fluctuations of interest. This problem can be particularly acute when the test fluid is water or similar liquid with a high bulk wave propagation velocity. The present paper describes a method for addressing this problem which permits wall pressure fluctuation experiments of high quality to be conducted within internal flow geometries over a bandwidth of 1 kHz. The method improves on a technique of using 3 flush mounted transducers located within a coaxial plane, thereby providing up to 20 dB reduction over previous measurements for the bandwidth investigated. Experimental results show that using the improved technique allows measurements of both the nearfield and farfield pressure components. Excellent agreement with previously reported wall pressure fluctuation measurements is demonstrated for the geometries evaluated.
