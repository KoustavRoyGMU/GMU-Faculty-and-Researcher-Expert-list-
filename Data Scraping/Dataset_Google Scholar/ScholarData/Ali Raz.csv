System architecting and design space characterization,"Ali K Raz, C Robert Kenley, Daniel A DeLaurentis",2018/5,Journal Systems Engineering,"This article provides a process for system architecting that incorporates a holistic approach for architecture design space characterization by integrating decision alternatives in functional, physical, and allocational design spaces and accounting for interactions. System architects are faced with numerous decisions for system form, functions, and operations when defining a system architecture. Systems designers are tasked with selecting design options which provide the necessary functionality in support of the architecture. Since modern systems, especially system‐of‐systems, are composed of interacting and interwoven functions and elements, it is imperative to holistically evaluate variations in the system architecture and system design, and discover interactions among and between architecture decisions and design decisions. In this article, this design space characterization is made an integral part of the system …",35
A System-of-Systems perspective for information fusion system design and evaluation,"Ali K Raz, C Robert Kenley, Daniel A DeLaurentis",2017/5/1,Journal Information Fusion,"This paper provides a System-of-Systems (SoS) perspective for integrated design and evaluation of an Information Fusion System (IFS). IFS is comprised of distributed and heterogeneous systems that accomplish low-level and high-level information fusion (LLIF and HLIF) functionality. LLIF and HLIF functions are developed independent from one another but require collaboration to achieve the IFS mission objectives. The distribution and heterogeneity of systems, in addition to the multiplicity of LLIF and HLIF functions, creates an extensively large design space for the IFS. We apply a SoS engineering architecting process to obtain integrated architectures of IFS and propose guidelines to constrain an otherwise infinite design space of Information Fusion System-of-Systems (IF-SoS). Furthermore, we elaborate a multi-agent system modeling approach and pair it with Design of Experiments for objective evaluation of …",34

Engineering for emergence in information fusion systems: A review of some challenges,"Ali K Raz, James Llinas, Ranjeev Mittu, William F Lawless",2020/1/1,Source Human-Machine Shared Contexts,"Modern information fusion (IF) systems are faced with evolving operational environments where human and intelligent systems will function as a team to achieve mission objectives. These evolving operational contexts demand a full spectrum dynamic response of “data to decision” from IF systems. Traditional information extraction and fusion levels typically address the “data” end of the spectrum, while recent advancement in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches is being used for the “decision” end of the spectrum. However, the IF system behavior emerges from the various complex interactions that take place between different fusion levels (including human interaction), the operational context, and the employed AI/ML techniques.

An information fusion system (IFS), then, is a system whose functional decomposition is given by the functional elicitation of the JDL-DFM. Given that the information fusion capability results from collaboration of multiple systems, it is no surprise that JDL-DFM functions are accomplished by heterogeneous and geospatially distributed independent systems which collectively realize the IFS.

New endeavors such as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) and COVID19 are challenging every aspect of the NextGEN rollout. Hence, to develop a safe and secure UTM, there is need for knowledge management. Knowledge management comes from awareness about the environment and awareness is based on assessment. The information fusion community has long developed methods for data fusion (eg, statistical analysis), sensor fusion (eg, navigation and tracking), information fusion (eg, Notice to Airman and air tracks), as well intelligence fusion (eg, response to malicious attacks) for knowledge assessment. Each of these techniques has opportunities to enable UTM autonomy, joint all-domain command and control, and surveillance. This paper explores the various uses of fusion available to support the autonomy. For example, three types of autonomy have been proposed: autonomy at rest (eg, flight plans, radar positions), autonomy in motion (eg, dynamic tracking with automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and weather), as well as autonomy in use (eg, getting the right data at the correct time). A use case is presented for UTM that utilizes data fusion from ADS-B, radar, LiDAR, and visual data to provide effective positioning in response to various cyber attacks on the ADS-B data.",4

Limited computational resources, highly nonlinear dynamics, poor solution convergence, and low robustness to uncertainty all contribute to the challenges of this problem space. Although, well-defined or pre-computed trajectories provide accurate and usable solutions, they are undesirable for executing near real-time maneuvers to address in-flight operational uncertainties because they are difficult to solve and are fundamentally inflexible. There are three main boundaries to generating trajectory updates for hypersonic vehicles—especially onboard the vehicle—in-flight. First, the capability to solve the full trajectory generation problem on-board is limited by available flight computational resources. Second, as the flight progresses, the number and magnitude of uncertainties vary and consequently change the optimization problem. In theory, multi-stage decision problems can be solved using dynamic programming, but often their exact solution is computationally intractable either due to long convergence times or a lack of solution convergence altogether. Third, given the high speeds and short decision times associated with hypersonic missions, enabling in-flight vehicle updates likely requires a situationally-aware vehicle equipped with real-time decision-making capabilities to address evolving mission parameters and perhaps even to incorporate information from local sensor systems.

System-of-Systems Acquisition Analytics Using Machine Learning Techniques,"Ali Raz, Prajwal Balasubramani, Stephanie Harrington, Cesare Guariniello, Daniel A DeLaurentis",2020/4/20,Publisher Acquisition Research Program,"System-of-Systems capability emerges from the collaboration of multiple systems, which are acquired from independent organizations. The systems within an SoS serve two purposes: one is to meet their own independent objectives, and the second is to contribute some capability to the SoS from which all constituents can benefit. In recent decades, the fields of machine learning and data analytics have found widespread application in system design and acquisitions. It is unanimously understood that any organization acquiring a complex system employs some form of data analytics to assess a system’s independent objectives. Even though the systems contribute to and benefit from the larger SoS, the data analytics and decision-making about the independent system is rarely shared across the SoS stakeholders. The objective of this work is to identify how the sharing of datasets and the corresponding analytics among SoS stakeholders can lead to an improved SoS capability. We propose to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the SoS capability by sharing pertinent datasets and prescribe the information links between systems to enable this sharing.

In this paper, we use a conceptual problem to demonstrate the impact that even small, intuitive changes in how data is collected, can result in different predictive and prescriptive analytic implementations. Thematic ideas of the framework are illustrated on the concept problem.",1

Potential for Using Deep Learning for Digital-Twin System Validation Testing,"Lance Sherry, Shamshad Ansari, James Baldo, Brett Berlin, John Shortle, Ali Raz",2022/9/18,Conference 2022 IEEE/AIAA 41st Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),"One of the challenges in designing and operating systems composed of interacting components is validating that the emergent behavior of the system does not cause one or more components to migrate, over time, into a hazardous operating state. Many modern airline accidents can be characterized as Interaction Accidents – no component failed, but the interaction of components resulted in a hazardous state.Due to the dependence of time, emergent behavior cannot be evaluated by analysis of the design. In theory it can be evaluated by Digital-Twin agent-based simulations.

This work includes prototype kit development targeting a comparable cost per kit as SeaPerch ($179) and SeaGlide ($249) and instructional materials comprised of demonstration videos and standards-aligned written curricular content to facilitate classroom implementation. LTA vehicles are utilized specifically for their unique ability to demonstrate fundamental concepts applicable to both aircraft and underwater vehicles including structural analysis, aerodynamics and hydrodynamics, biologically inspired propulsion, systems engineering, and swarm dynamics, without requiring student access to pools or other bodies of water.",
Work in Progress: Aligning a Professional Development Program with Industry Needs,"Audeen Fentiman, John Sutherland, Daniel Delaurentis, Kerrie Douglas, Jorge Dorribo Camba, C Robert Kenley, Ali Raz, Adrie Koehler, Wanju Huang, Andrew Hurt, Jennifer Richardson",2022/8/23,Conference 2022 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is being widely discussed, and by some, vigorously pursued, as a replacement for the standard paper-based approach to system/production engineering, which is costly and slow. MBSE provides a methodical approach to build a holistic model in a digital space that elucidates functional, physical, and behavioral interdependencies and guides the entire product life-cycle development and engineering. Thus, MBSE allows companies to bring new processes, production systems, and products to the market more quickly and at a competitive cost. However, this holistic approach requires that all employees who work in the digital space become familiar with MBSE. Our project is designed to help address this need for professional development for current and future employees of organizations transitioning to MBSE.",

MBSE for System-of-Systems,"Daniel DeLaurentis, Ali Raz, Cesare Guariniello",2022/6/28,Book Handbook of Model-Based Systems Engineering,"A System-of-Systems (SoS) is a special kind of complex system in which new capabilities arise from interacting components that are controlled with varying degrees of independence by multiple owner/operators. Thus, the capabilities generated by an SoS are not merely a sum of the capabilities of individual constituent systems, but instead are an emergent property stemming from their interactions. Thus, SoS behavior over time is highly dependent on the dynamic and evolving character of those interaction. Further, the architecture of an SoS consists not only of the constituent systems, but of their interfaces and the communication and exchanges occurring between the systems. In this context, model-based system engineering methods, processes, and tools are especially important for supporting desired evolutionary development of the SoS as the architecture is almost always in a state of flux.

Modeling the Combined Effect of Powertrain Options and Autonomous Technology on Vehicle Adoption and Utilization by Line-haul Fleets,"Ana Guerrero de la Peña, Navindran Davendralingam, Ali K Raz, Daniel DeLaurentis, Gregory Shaver, Vivek Sujan, Neera Jain",2019/10/27,Conference 2019 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),"In this paper we present a model formulation to predict the powertrain and autonomy technology adoption in a line-haul freight transportation network. The vehicle adoption and utilization behaviors of fleets operating in the network are represented as a mixed integer linear program. Powertrain technologies evaluated include diesel engines, compressed and liquefied natural gas engines, diesel-electric hybrid, battery electric, and hydrogen fuel cell. Levels of autonomy introduced to the market include Level 2, Level 4, and Level 5 as defined by SAE standards. Simulated case scenarios are presented to demonstrate the utility of the model, with an emphasis on the types of insights that can be gained by analyzing both vehicle adoption and utilization. This in turn makes the proposed model a more effective tool for policy-making and other strategic decision-making.",
