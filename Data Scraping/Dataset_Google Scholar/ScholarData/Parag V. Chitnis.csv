Fully Dense UNet for 2-D Sparse Photoacoustic Tomography Artifact Removal,"Steven Guan, Amir A Khan, Siddhartha Sikdar, Parag V Chitnis",2019/4/23,Journal IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Photoacoustic imaging is an emerging imaging modality that is based upon the photoacoustic effect. In photoacoustic tomography (PAT), the induced acoustic pressure waves are measured by an array of detectors and used to reconstruct an image of the initial pressure distribution. A common challenge faced in PAT is that the measured acoustic waves can only be sparsely sampled. Reconstructing sparsely sampled data using standard methods results in severe artifacts that obscure information within the image. We propose a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture termed fully dense UNet (FD-UNet) for removing artifacts from two-dimensional PAT images reconstructed from sparse data and compare the proposed CNN with the standard UNet in terms of reconstructed image quality.",273
Acoustic field of a ballistic shock wave therapy device,"Robin O Cleveland, Parag V Chitnis, Scott R McClure",2007/8/1,Journal Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology,Shock wave therapy (SWT) refers to the use of focused shock waves for treatment of musculoskeletal indications including plantar fascitis and dystrophic mineralization of tendons and joint capsules. Measurements were made of a SWT device that uses a ballistic source. The ballistic source consists of a handpiece within which compressed air (1–4 bar) is used to fire a projectile that strikes a metal applicator placed on the skin. The projectile generates stress waves in the applicator that transmit as pressure waves into tissue. The acoustic fields from two applicators were measured: one applicator was 15 mm in diameter and the surface slightly convex and the second was 12 mm in diameter the surface was concave. Measurements were made in a water tank and both applicators generated a similar pressure pulse consisting of a rectangular positive phase (4 μs duration and up to 8 MPa peak pressure) followed by a …,120

The target was a porous ceramic disk through which air could be forced. Transient cavitation bubbles were created using a shock-wave lithotripter focused on the surface of the disk. The dynamics of bubble clouds near the ceramic disks were studied for two boundary conditions: no back pressure resulting in surface free of bubbles and 10 psi (0.7 atm) of back pressure, resulting in a surface with a sparse (30% of area) bubble layer. Images of the cavitation near the surface were obtained from a high-speed camera. Additionally, a passive cavitation detector (3.5 MHz focused acoustic transducer) was aligned with the surface.

Towards real-time muscle fatigue and recovery markers using a wearable continuous wave Doppler ultrasound system,"Joseph Majdi, Parag V Chitnis, Siddhartha Sikdar",2020/10,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is commonly used in physical rehabilitation, bypassing the central nervous system to activate motor neurons directly. However, the unnatural muscle recruitment pattern induced by FES causes rapid muscle fatigue, greatly reducing the muscle's ability to generate force. Currently there exists no reliable, real time indicator for FES-induced muscle fatigue. We believe that signs of muscle fatigue can be inferred from medical ultrasound. Previously we investigated tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) to study muscle physiology associated with muscle potentiation and fatigue. Here, we expand on that research using continuous wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound to create a wearable, low power muscle fatigue monitor.

We implemented a novel computational method that optimally registers volumetric ultrasound image data containing significant and local anatomical differences. It is A Multi-stage, Multi-resolution, and Multi-volumes-of-interest Volume Registration Method. A single region registration is optimized first for a close initial alignment to avoid convergence to a locally optimal solution. Multiple sub-volumes of interest can then be selected as target alignment regions to achieve confident consistency across the volume. Finally, a multi-resolution rigid registration is performed on these sub-volumes associated with different weights in the cost function. We applied the method on 3D endovaginal ultrasound image data acquired from patients during biopsy procedure of the pelvic floor muscle. Systematic assessment of our proposed method through cross validation demonstrated its accuracy and robustness. The algorithm can also be applied on medical imaging data of other modalities for which the traditional rigid registration methods would fail.",

The use of the photoacoustic effect for non‐invasive temperature monitoring during high intensity focused ultrasound exposures.,"James R McLaughlan, Parag V Chitnis, Jonathan Mamou, Todd W Murray, Ronald A Roy",2009/10/6,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non‐invasive technique for treating soft tissue tumors. A feasibility study for using the photoacoustic (PA) effect to monitor in‐situ temperature changes during HIFU exposures is presented. A PA wave is generated from the thermoelastic expansion of a light‐absorbing medium with its amplitude related to the Grüneisen parameter of the medium, which, for water, depends linearly on temperature. A 2‐MHz HIFU transducer heated a cylindrical graphite inclusion in which a wire thermocouple was embedded. A 532‐nm pulsed laser illuminated the inclusion at a rate of 10 Hz, and a 15‐MHz passive transducer monitored the PA response throughout the 30‐s exposure. Singular‐value‐decomposition analysis of the PA response was performed to extract the contribution from temperature change. Thermocouple measurements indicated a temperature increase from 22–60 °C …",
Response of ultrasound contrast agents to static overpressure.,"Parag V Chitnis, Paul Lee, Jonathan Mamou, Jeffrey A Ketterling",2009/10/6,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"This study investigated the static pressure threshold for contrast agent (CA) rupture. Polymer‐shelled CAs (mean diameter of 3 μm) with a constant shell‐thickness‐to‐radius ratio (STRR) were subjected to overpressure in a cylindrical test chamber containing an optical window on its top and bottom faces. A video‐microscope (50× magnification, 128 μm FOV, 1 Mpixel CCD) was used to image the CAs while static pressure was increased from 0.5‐22 psi by pumping water into the chamber at a constant flow rate. An image processing algorithm was used to determine the change in diameter as a function of static pressure for each CA (total of 130). The majority of CAs did not respond to static overpressure until the threshold for shell rupture was exceeded, resulting in abrupt destruction. The probability density function of rupture pressures exhibited four lobes and four subsets that were obtained by a k‐means algorithm …",
"Subharmonic response from single, polymer‐shell contrast agents subjected to high‐frequency excitation.","Parag V Chitnis, Jonathan Mamou, Paul Lee, Jeffrey A Ketterling",2009/4/8,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"Three polymer‐shelled agents (nominal mean diameters of 0.56, 1.1, and 3.4 μm) from POINT Biomedical were investigated to determine the optimal parameter space for generating a subharmonic response from single agents when subjected to high‐frequency (above 20 MHz) excitation. A flow phantom was constructed to restrict the flow of a dilute contrast agent solution to a small volume. Two single‐element transducers, with nominal center frequencies of 40 and 20 MHz, were aligned such that they were confocal and orthogonal to each other, and their mutual focus was positioned within the flow phantom. The 40 MHz transducer was used in transmit/receive mode while the 20 MHz transducer was used passively in the receive mode.

Introduction of a compliant gas‐layer serves to mitigate damage to solid surfaces from the collapse of cavitation bubble clouds,"Parag V Chitnis, Nicholas J Manzi, Robin O Cleveland, Ronald A Roy, R Glynn Holt",2008/5/1,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"The collapse of transient bubble clouds near a boundary was investigated. Transient cavitation bubbles were created using a shock‐wave lithotripter. A porous ceramic disk (flow‐pressure 7.5psi) was placed at the lithotripter focus. Air was forced through the disk to alter the boundary condition at the ceramic disk's proximal face. Gas pressure below 7.5psi resulted in a ceramic disk partially filled with fluid (rigid boundary); gas pressure over 7.5psi resulted in active bubbling at the proximal face (compliant boundary). Cavitation dynamics of bubble clouds near ceramic disks were studied for varying gas pressures (0‐10psi). Images of the collapse were obtained from a high‐speed camera.

Transient bubbles were created using a focused laser, and a shock‐wave lithotripter. Two boundary types were investigated, rigid and smooth, and rigid and porous. The porous boundary was either gas‐saturated, or actively bubbling. Acoustic emissions from the collapsing transient bubbles were measured with a hydrophone. Boundary vibrations were (in some cases) measured using a laser vibrometer. Images of the collapse were also obtained from a high‐speed camera.

Customization of acoustic output in lithotripsy using a piezoelectric transducer array,"Parag V Chitnis, Robin O Cleveland",2006/5/4,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"A piezoelectric array was employed to examine the role of waveform shaping on stone fragmentation in lithotripsy. The array consisted of 170 elements placed on the inner surface of a 15‐cm‐radius spherical cap. Each element was driven independently using 170 individual pulsers—each capable of generating 1.2 kV. The acoustic field was characterized using a fiber optic probe hydrophone with a bandwidth of 30 MHz and a spatial resolution of 100 μm. When all elements were driven simultaneously, the focal waveform was a shock wave with peak pressures p+=65±3 MPa and p−=−16±2 MPa and the focal region was cigar shaped: 13 mm long and 2 mm wide. The firing of group of elements was adjusted so that each groups focused to different locations in the geometric focal plane.

Measuring bubble dynamics in lithotripsy using a high‐speed camera,"Parag V Chitnis, Robin O Cleveland",2006/5/4,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,The primary goal of this study was to examine bubble dynamics in shock wave lithotripsy and experimentally obtain the radius‐time (r‐t) profile. A piezoelectric array was employed as a shock wave (SW) source. The focal waveform (as measured with a fiber optic probe hydrophone) was double‐peaked with two shocks: leading peak pressure 65±3 MPa and second peak 30±3 MPa. The negative phase in between had a peak p−=−16±2 MPa. The cavitation field was monitored using a dual passive cavitation detector consisting of two 1‐MHz focused transducers. The second peak of the SW inhibited cavitation limiting the characteristic time to less than 60 μs. A high‐speed camera (up to 10 million frames per second) with a spatial resolution of 2 μm/pixel was used to measure bubble dynamics.

The acoustic fields of shock wave therapy devices,"Robin O Cleveland, Parag V Chitnis",2005/4/1,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,"We report measurements of a number of different shock wave therapy (SWT) devices.

The other device was a pneumatically driven device (EMS Swiss Dolorclast) and two different hand pieces were measured, one with an ‘‘unfocused’’ head and the other with a ‘‘focused’’ head. We found that the EH sources generated focused shock waves with a positive phase about 1 microsec long and peak pressure around 40 MPa, however, the acoustic output of the HMT Evotron appeared to be independent of the power setting of the machine. For the pneumatic source the duration of the positive phase was greater than 4 microsec and the peak pressure about 7 MPa.

Acoustic and cavitation fields produced by shock wave therapy (SWT) devices with different generating principles,"Robin O Cleveland, Parag V Chitnis",2003/10/8,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,We present measurements from two SWT devices with different generating principles: an electrohydraulic source (EHS) with a focusing reflector (HMT Equitron) and a pneumatic source (PS) with no focusing (EMS Swiss Dolorclast). The acoustic field was measured with a PVDF membrane hydrophone.

Simultaneous measurements of the cavitation and acoustic fields of an electrohydraulic lithotripter,"Parag Chitnis, Javier Van Cauwelaert, Robin Cleveland",2003/10/8,Journal The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,Simultaneous measurements of the cavitation and acoustic fields were carried out in an electrohydraulic lithotripter. Cavitation was measured with a dual passive cavitation detector (PCD) and acoustic pressure with a fiber optic probe hydrophone. The devices were positioned so that they measured the same volume of space. Measurements were acquired at various locations in the field of the lithotripter. The characteristic time (t—c) was used as a parameter for quantifying the strength of cavitation activity. At the focus we found a linear correlation between the peak negative pressure (P−) of the SW and t—c as well as between the area under the negative tail and t—c. The maximum t—c was found to be 500 μs at P− of 10 MPa and the minimum value of t—c was 200 μs at P− of 5 MPa.

The cavitation field induced by the SWs was measured using a dual passive cavitation detector consisting of two 1 MHz focused transducers. The characteristic time (tc) was obtained from the time difference of the arrival of the SW and the inertial collapse of the cavitating bubble. The tc increased significantly with energy level for both lithotripters. At the highest energy level, tc=332 μs±65 μs for the EML and tc=277 μs±43 μs for the EHL. Increasing the pulse rate frequency from 1 Hz to 2 Hz led to a significant increase in tc for the EHL but no significant change for the EML.

RESNA Annual Conference-2020,"Joseph A Majdi, Parag V Chitnis, Siddhartha Sikdar","A significant challenge in improving the design of assistive technologies for rehabilitation of individuals with neuromuscular deficits is the limited ability to robustly sense muscle activity and function. For the past 50 years, surface electromyography (sEMG) has been the dominant standard for detecting muscle activity for prosthetics [1] and is also widely used for rehabilitation and biomechanics research. However, sEMG lacks spatial specificity and suffers from poor SNR [2]. Despite these limitations, sEMG has been widely used for estimating muscle force, and fatigue [3]. However, sEMG is generally incompatible with electrical stimulation, which is often used either as a therapeutic intervention or in conjunction with assistive technologies, as sEMG signals are typically saturated by current injection during electrical stimulation.Due to the well-documented limitations of sEMG, alternative biosignal sensing methods for studying muscle activation have been investigated. Mechanomyography (MMG) is a class of mechanical alternatives to sEMG, which record forces and physical energy transfer from muscle activation. Several variants exist from measuring muscle radial displacement (tensiomyography, TMG)[4] to passively recording soundwaves generated by muscle contractions (acoustic myography, AMG)[5, 6]. Because these techniques measure mechanical activity (as opposed to electrical activity), they provide a meaningful measure of active muscle contractions that is not dependent on excitation-activation coupling [5].
