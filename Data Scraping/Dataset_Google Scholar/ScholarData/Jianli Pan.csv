Future Edge Cloud and Edge Computing for Internet of Things Applications,"Jianli Pan, James McElhannon",2017/10,Journal IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IOT-J),"The Internet is evolving rapidly toward the future Internet of Things (IoT) which will potentially connect billions or even trillions of edge devices which could generate huge amount of data at a very high speed and some of the applications may require very low latency. The traditional cloud infrastructure will run into a series of difficulties due to centralized computation, storage, and networking in a small number of datacenters, and due to the relative long distance between the edge devices and the remote datacenters. To tackle this challenge, edge cloud and edge computing seem to be a promising possibility which provides resources closer to the resource-poor edge IoT devices and potentially can nurture a new IoT innovation ecosystem. Such prospect is enabled by a series of emerging technologies, including network function virtualization and software defined networking. In this survey paper, we investigate the …",649

Application Delivery in Cloud and Multi-Cloud Environments using Software Defined Networking,"Subharthi Paul, Raj Jain, Jianli Pan",2014,Journal Computer Networks,"Today, most large Application Service Providers (ASPs) such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon and Facebook operate multiple geographically distributed datacenters, serving a global user population that are often mobile. However, the service-centric deployment and delivery semantics of these modern Internet-scale applications do not fit naturally into the Internet’s host-centric design. In this service-centric model, users connect to a service, and not a particular host. A service virtualizes the application endpoint, and could be replicated, partitioned, distributed and composed over many different hosts in many different locations. To address this gap between design and use, ASPs deploy a service-centric network infrastructure within their enterprise datacenter environments while maintaining a (virtual) host-centric service access interface with the rest-of-the-Internet.

HomeCloud: An edge cloud framework and testbed for new application delivery,"Jianli Pan, Lin Ma, Ravishankar Ravindran, Peyman TalebiFard",2016/5/16,Conference IEEE International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT),"Conventional centralized cloud computing is a success for benefits such as on-demand, elasticity, and high colocation of data and computation.

A Vision of the Next Generation Internet: A Policy Oriented Perspective.,"Subharthi Paul, Raj Jain, Jianli Pan, Mic Bowman",2008/9/22,Conference British Computer Society (BCS) International Conference on Visions of Computer Science,"The host centric design of the current Internet does not recognise data and endusers as integral entities of the system. The first generation of Internet has been very successful and yet business, organizations, governments are finding it difficult to enforce their policies on their networks with the same ease that they do other methods of communications and transport. Ad-Hoc solutions e.g. firewalls, NAT, middleboxes etc, that try to mitigate these issues end up providing localized myopic fixes which often hurt the basic underlying principles of the original design. We envision the future internet to be a dynamic, heterogeneous, secure, energy efficient ubiquitous network flexible enough to support innovations and policy enforcements both at the edge and the core. The first step towards the next generation is the redesign of naming and name binding mechanisms. We, therefore, propose a Policy Oriented Network Architecture (PONA) and an abstract two part protocol stack with a virtualization layer in between.

The findings show that due to the centrally controlled Heating, Ventilation, Air-conditioning, and Cooling (HAVC) systems, the total energy consumption in large office buildings of this type is not proportional to the actual usage and occupancy. Even correlation to outside weather is low. Through the lessons learned from energy saving efforts in computer industry, we envision an Energy-Proportional Building …",10

DeepEdge: A New QoE-based Resource Allocation Framework Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Future Heterogeneous Edge-IoT Applications,"Ismail Alqerm, Jianli Pan",2021/11,Journal IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (TNSM),"Edge computing is emerging to empower the future of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, due to heterogeneity of applications, it is a significant challenge for the edge cloud to effectively allocate multidimensional limited resources (CPU, memory, storage, bandwidth, etc.) with constraints of applications’ Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we address the resource allocation problem in Edge-IoT systems through developing a novel framework named  DeepEdge  that allocates resources to the heterogeneous IoT applications with the goal of maximizing users’ Quality of Experience (QoE). To achieve this goal, we develop a novel QoE model that considers aligning the heterogeneous requirements of IoT applications to the available edge resources. The alignment is achieved through selection of QoS requirement range that can be satisfied by the available resources. In addition, we propose …",8
An Access Control Mechanism Based on Risk Prediction for the IoV,"Yuanni Liu, Man Xiao, Jianli Pan, etc.",2020,Conference IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC),"The information sharing among vehicles provides intelligent transport applications in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), such as self-driving and traffic awareness. However, due to the openness of the wireless communication (e.g., DSRC), the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information resources are easy to be hacked by illegal access, which threatens the security of the related IoV applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Risk Prediction-Based Access Control model, named RPBAC, which assigns the access rights to a node by predicting the risk level. Considering the impact of limited training datasets on prediction accuracy, we first introduce the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in our risk prediction module. The GAN increases the items of training sets to train the Neural Network, which is used to predict the risk level of vehicles.

IEEE Access Special Section Editorial: Recent Advances in Software Defined Networking for 5G Networks,"Mugen Peng, Tao Huang, Richard Yu, Jianli Pan",2016/1,Journal IEEE Access,"The demand for flexible network management has been growing significantly over the last several decades, which comes with a series of other related demands in network virtualization, stringent security, tenant isolation in cloud, and high performance and reliability for broadband access. To meet these demands from both users and enterprises, numerous networking protocols had been designed and developed. However, these protocols were usually defined independently targeting various specific problems using different systems and sub-systems, without a holistic approach. On the other hand, cloud computing brings many challenges to traditional networking, from naming and addressing to the traditional routing. In addition, companies seek to use more standard and vendor-independent equipment to reduce the Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX).",3
Enhanced Evaluation of the Interdomain Routing System for Balanced Routing Scalability and New Internet Architecture Deployments,"Jianli Pan, Raj Jain, Subharthi Paul",2013,Issue 99,"Internet is facing many challenges that cannot be solved easily through ad hoc patches. To address these challenges, many research programs and projects have been initiated and many solutions are being proposed. However, before we have a new architecture that can motivate Internet service providers (ISPs) to deploy and evolve, we need to address two issues: 1) know the current status better by appropriately evaluating the existing Internet; and 2) find how various incentives and strategies will affect the deployment of the new architecture. For the first issue, we define a series of quantitative metrics that can potentially unify results from several measurement projects using different approaches and can be an intrinsic part of future Internet architecture (FIA) for monitoring and evaluation.

A Novel Incremental-Deployable Multi-granularity Multihoming Framework for the Future Internet,"Jianli Pan, Raj Jain, Subharthi Paul",2012/12,Conference IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),"Multihoming practice in the current Internet is limited to hosts and autonomous systems (ASs). It is “connectivity-oriented” without support for user or data multihoming. However, the swift migration of Internet from “connectivity-oriented” to “content-oriented” pattern urges to incorporate user and data level multihoming support in architecture designs instead of just through ad-hoc patches. In this paper, based on our previous research experience, we expand the multihoming concepts to both user and data levels based on the “multiple points of attachment” in a way similar to host multihoming. We propose a new incrementally-deployable multihoming framework by introducing a “realm” concept.

They are also facing their own evolution and growth challenges in their respective contexts. For Internet, its primary arena has changed dramatically from its initial academic usage to the commercial world which brought a series of significant research challenges and issues related to the Internet's architectural evolution. The power grid, on the other hand, has a strong need to transform its infrastructure with more intelligence, using networking and computing technologies. Creating a smarter power grid in energy consuming buildings will improve the operation, efficiency, security, and power quality of the grid. Thus, in this dissertation, we not only study the Internet core evolution, we also study a particular edge network application in intelligent buildings in the interdisciplinary context of networking and energy efficiency. In particular, this dissertation covers two inter-correlated parts: PART I: next generation Internet architecture and related research issues such as inter-domain routing, naming and addressing, mobility and multihoming, renumbering, traffic engineering, security, and policy enforcement; PART II: inter-disciplinary topics related to cyber-assisted energy efficiency in intelligent buildings and cyber-assisted sustainability.

We, therefore, propose an incremental architecture strategy that helps solve the problems of scalability, mobility, multihoming and traffic engineering in the current Internet, and allows evolving towards realizing the clean slate architectural goals.","Scholar articles RANGI: Evolving Internet Routing Architecture from Present to the Next GenerationS Paul, J Pan, R Jain, X XuRelated articles All 5 versions ","We propose a clean slate design for the next generation Internet architecture that allows natural sharing of resources among multiple organizations. Our architecture consists of a 3-tier object model. The bottom tier consists of the network infrastructure owned by multiple Internet service providers. The second tier consists of hosts that may be owned by different organizations. The third tier consists of users and data objects. This results in a three tiered virtualization model as compared to the traditional single-tier infrastructure virtualization. In today’s Internet the infrastructure, the hosts, and users belong to different organizations (as in cloud computing) but are not correctly represented in the architecture resulting in several issues. We, therefore, propose an incremental architecture strategy that helps solve the problems of scalability, mobility, multihoming and traffic engineering in the current Internet, and allows evolving towards realizing the clean slate architectural goals.",
