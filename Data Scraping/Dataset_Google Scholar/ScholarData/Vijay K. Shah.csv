Designing delay constrained hybrid ad hoc network infrastructure for post-disaster communication,"Sujoy Saha, Subrata Nandi, Partha Sarathi Paul, Vijay K Shah, Akash Roy, Sajal K Das",2015/2/1,Journal Ad Hoc Networks,"Following a disaster-strike, rapid and reliable communication between relief/rescue workers in the affected regions, and the control stations located at a distance, is essential. This is to facilitate seamless information exchange about the status of victims, requirement of relief personnel/commodities, supply chain of goods and services, and so on, thus rendering relief operations more timely and effective. However, the availability of Internet in a post-disaster scenario is ruled out more often than not; wireless communication and mobile phones may not be usable either except in only selected areas. Besides, geographical obstructions such as broken bridges or closed roads add to the worries of personnel trying to develop a temporary network infrastructure for effective communication. Furthermore, availability of resources – both technological and financial – may prove to be a bottleneck in case of disasters in under …",56
3D placement and orientation of mmWave-based UAVs for guaranteed LoS coverage,"Javad Sabzehali, Vijay K Shah, Harpreet S Dhillon, Jeffrey H Reed",2021/4/29,Journal IEEE Wireless Communications Letters,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as aerial base stations, are a promising solution for providing wireless communications, thanks to their high flexibility and autonomy. Moreover, emerging services, such as extended reality, require high-capacity communications. To achieve this, millimeter wave (mmWave), and recently, terahertz bands have been considered for UAV communications. However, communication at these high frequencies requires a line-of-sight (LoS) to the terminals, which may be located in 3D space and may have extremely limited direct-line-of-view (LoV) due to blocking objects, like buildings and trees. In this letter, we investigate the problem of determining 3D placement and orientation of UAVs such that users have guaranteed LoS coverage by at least one UAV and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the UAV-user pairs are maximized.

$ QnQ $ Q n Q: Quality and Quantity Based Unified Approach for Secure and Trustworthy Mobile Crowdsensing,"Shameek Bhattacharjee, Nirnay Ghosh, Vijay K Shah, Sajal K Das",2018/12/23,Journal IEEE transactions on mobile computing,"A major challenge in mobile crowdsensing applications is the generation of false (or spam) contributions resulting from selfish and malicious behaviors of users, or wrong perception of an event. Such false contributions induce loss of revenue owing to undue incentivization, and also affect the operational reliability of the applications. To counter these problems, we propose an event-trust and user-reputation model, called QnQ, to segregate different user classes such as honest, selfish, or malicious. The resultant user reputation scores, are based on both `quality' (accuracy of contribution) and `quantity' (degree of participation) of their contributions. Specifically, QnQ exploits a rating feedback mechanism for evaluating an event-specific expected truthfulness, which is then transformed into a robust quality of information (QoI) metric to weaken various effects of selfish and malicious user behaviors. Eventually, the QoIs of …",26
Toward Next Generation Open Radio Access Networks: What O-RAN Can and Cannot Do!,"Aly S Abdalla, Pratheek S Upadhyaya, Vijay K Shah, Vuk Marojevic",2022/7/25,Journal IEEE Network,"The open radio access network (O-RAN) describes an industry-driven open architecture and interfaces for building next generation RANs with artificial intelligence (AI) controllers. We circulated a survey among researchers, developers, and practitioners to gather their perspectives on O-RAN as a framework for 6G wireless research and development (R&D). The majority responded in favor of O-RAN and identified R&D of interest to them. Motivated by these responses, this article identifies the limitations of the current O-RAN specifications and the technologies for overcoming them.

Fast initial access with deep learning for beam prediction in 5G mmWave networks,"Tarun S Cousik, Vijay K Shah, Jeffrey H Reed, Tugba Erpek, Yalin E Sagduyu",2021/11/29,Conference MILCOM 2021-2021 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM),"We present DeepIA, a deep learning solution for a fast, reliable and secure initial access (IA) in directional networks such as the mmWave networks in 5G systems. By utilizing only a subset of beams during the IA process, DeepIA removes the need for an exhaustive beam search thereby reducing the beam sweep time in IA. A deep neural network (DNN) is trained to learn the complex mapping from the received signal strengths (RSSs) collected with a reduced number of beams to the optimal spatial beam of the receiver (among a larger set of beams). In test time, DeepIA measures the RSSs only from a small number of beams and runs the DNN to predict the best beam for IA. We show that DeepIA reduces the IA time by sweeping fewer beams and significantly outperforms the conventional IA's beam prediction accuracy in both line of sight (LoS) and non-line of sight (NLoS) mmWave channel conditions.",22

Joint age of information and self risk assessment for safer 802.11 p based V2V networks,"Biplav Choudhury, Vijay K Shah, Avik Dayal, Jeffrey H Reed",2021/5/10,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2021-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,"Emerging 802.11p vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks rely on periodic Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) to disseminate time-sensitive safety-critical information, such as vehicle position, speed, and heading - that enables several safety applications and has the potential to improve on-road safety. Due to mobility, lack of global-knowledge and limited communication resources, designing an optimal BSM broadcast rate-control protocol is challenging. Recently, minimizing Age of Information (AoI) has gained momentum in designing BSM broadcast rate-control protocols. In this paper, we show that minimizing AoI solely does not always improve the safety of V2V networks.

Ctr: Cluster based topological routing for disaster response networks,"Vijay K Shah, Satyaki Roy, Simone Silvestri, Sajal K Das",2017/5/21,Conference 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),"Large scale disasters require prompt rescue and relief operations to restrict further casualties. To carry out such operations, it is essential to have a communication infrastructure between survivors and responders, which is often impaired due to the disaster. Off-the-shelf wireless devices such as smartphones, PDAs and Laptops offer an effective solution towards the establishment of makeshift communication infrastructure. However, in the absence of bonafide power sources, it becomes imperative to judiciously utilize energy (battery power) of such devices such that the network is functional until primary infrastructure is restored. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Cluster based Topological Routing (CTR) that prolongs the longevity of the network by exploiting the natural gathering of survivors in shelter points.

Designing sustainable smart connected communities using dynamic spectrum access via band selection,"Vijay K Shah, Shameek Bhattacharjee, Simone Silvestri, Sajal K Das",2017/11/8,Book Proceedings of the 4th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Built Environments,"While designing communication systems for sustainable smart connected communities (SCCs), energy efficiency is as important as quality of service (QoS). However, simultaneous achievement of both is difficult due to the varying demands posed by heterogeneous sensing modalities, lack of dedicated infrastructure in rural areas, and certain sustainability constraints. While low-power short range technologies often fail to achieve high QoS, using 3GPP technologies (LTE, LTE-A,GSM) for SCCs will eventually face spectrum scarcity and cross technology interference. While dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been proposed to overcome policy constraints and improve spectrum scarcity by spectrum sharing, we show in this paper that harnessing DSA in the context of SCCs can achieve benefits in terms of end-to-end energy efficiency.

After the devastation, to restore the communication system in ad hoc basis; ensuring almost 100% packet delivery within acceptable latency with optimal utilization of resources are prime design motives. Our work proposes a four tier planned hybrid architecture, which conforms the aforesaid motives yielding a desired performance in terms of delivery probability within least latency, for a given disaster hit area map with a suitable heuristic algorithm. Our study also reveals that there exists no deterministic polynomial time solution that can implement the desired design motives as well as the feasibility of our planned methodology.

For BSM scheduling, decentralized V2X networks utilize sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SPS), where vehicles sense radio resources and select suitable resources for BSM transmissions at prespecified periodic intervals termed as Resource Reservation Interval (RRI). In this paper, we show that such a BSM scheduling (with a fixed RRI) suffers from severe under- and over-utilization of radio resources under varying vehicle traffic scenarios; which severely compromises timely dissemination of BSMs, which in turn leads to increased collision risks.

A primary reason is that the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) providers have less incentives to invest in rural areas due to lack of promising revenue returns. Existing research and industrial attempts in providing connectivity to rural communities suffer from severe drawbacks, such as expensive wireless spectrum licenses and infrastructures, under-and over-provisioning of spectrum resources while handling heterogeneous traffic, lack of novel wireless technologies tailored to the unique challenges and requirements of rural communities (eg, agricultural fields).",1
"AI Testing Framework for Next-G O-RAN Networks: Requirements, Design, and Research Opportunities","Bo Tang, Vijay K Shah, Vuk Marojevic, Jeffrey H Reed",2022/11/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.03979,"Openness and intelligence are two enabling features to be introduced in next generation wireless networks, e.g. Beyond 5G and 6G, to support service heterogeneity, open hardware, optimal resource utilization, and on-demand service deployment. The open radio access network (O-RAN) is a promising RAN architecture to achieve both openness and intelligence through virtualized network elements and well-defined interfaces. While deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming easier in O-RAN, one significant challenge that has been long neglected is the comprehensive testing of their performance in realistic environments. This article presents a general automated, distributed and AI-enabled testing framework to test AI models deployed in O-RAN in terms of their decision-making performance, vulnerability and security. This framework adopts a master-actor architecture to manage a number of end devices for distributed testing. More importantly, it leverages AI to automatically and intelligently explore the decision space of AI models in O-RAN. Both software simulation testing and software-defined radio hardware testing are supported, enabling rapid proof of concept research and experimental research on wireless research platforms.",
Reliable Backhauling in Aerial Communication Networks Against UAV Failures: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Prasenjit Karmakar, Vijay K Shah, Satyaki Roy, Krishnandu Hazra, Sujoy Saha, Subrata Nandi",2022/8/8,Journal IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized as aerial base stations to establish wireless communication networks in various challenging scenarios, such as emergency disaster areas and rural areas. Under large regions, the aerial communication networks would require UAVs to form wireless (backhaul) links among each other to provide end-to-end wireless services between two or more ground users (via one or more UAVs). Such UAV backhauling in aerial communication networks may be severely compromised if one or more UAVs are knocked off during the time of operation – it may be due to UAV hardware/software faults, limited battery, malicious attacks, etc. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for learning tasks with large state and continuous action spaces. In this paper, we leverage emerging DRL to achieve reliable backhauling in an aerial communication network that …",
Learning based Age of Information Minimization in UAV-relayed IoT Networks,"Biplav Choudhury, Prasenjit Karmakar, Vijay K Shah, Jeffrey H Reed",2022/3/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.04227,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used as aerial base-stations to relay time-sensitive packets from IoT devices to the nearby terrestrial base-station (TBS). Scheduling of packets in such UAV-relayed IoT-networks to ensure fresh (or up-to-date) IoT devices' packets at the TBS is a challenging problem as it involves two simultaneous steps of (i) sampling of packets generated at IoT devices by the UAVs [hop-1] and (ii) updating of sampled packets from UAVs to the TBS [hop-2]. To address this, we propose Age-of-Information (AoI) scheduling algorithms for two-hop UAV-relayed IoT-networks. First, we propose a low-complexity AoI scheduler, termed, MAF-MAD that employs Maximum AoI First (MAF) policy for sampling of IoT devices at UAV (hop-1) and Maximum AoI Difference (MAD) policy for updating sampled packets from UAV to the TBS (hop-2). We prove that MAF-MAD is the optimal AoI scheduler under ideal conditions (lossless wireless channels and generate-at-will traffic-generation at IoT devices). On the contrary, for general conditions (lossy channel conditions and varying periodic traffic-generation at IoT devices), a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, namely, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based scheduler is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed PPO-based scheduler outperforms other schedulers like MAF-MAD, MAF, and round-robin in all considered general scenarios.",
Cross-layer Band Selection and Routing Design for Diverse Band-aware DSA Networks,"Pratheek S Upadhyaya, Vijay K Shah, Jeffrey H Reed",2020/12/7,Conference GLOBECOM 2020-2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference,"As several new spectrum bands are opening up for shared use, a new paradigm of Diverse Band-aware Dynamic Spectrum Access (d-DSA) has emerged. d-DSA equips a secondary device with software defined radios (SDRs) and utilize whitespaces (or idle channels) in multiple bands, including but not limited to TV, LTE, Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), unlicensed ISM. In this paper, we propose a decentralized, online multi-agent reinforcement learning based cross-layer BAnd selection and Routing Design (BARD) for such d-DSA networks. BARD not only harnesses whitespaces in multiple spectrum bands, but also accounts for unique electro-magnetic characteristics of those bands to maximize the desired quality of service (QoS) requirements of heterogeneous message packets; while also ensuring no harmful interference to the primary users in the utilized band.

Experimental Analysis of Safety Performance in V2V networks,"Biplav Choudhury, Vijay K Shah, Avik Dayal, Jeffrey H Reed","Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication networks enable safety applications via periodic broadcast of Basic Safety Messages (BSM) or beacons, that includes time-critical information such as, sender vehicle’s location, speed, and direction. The vehicle density may be very large in certain scenarios, and such V2V networks may suffer from channel congestion and undesirable level of packet collisions; which in turn may seriously jeopardize safety application reliability and cause collision risky situations. In this work, we perform experimental analysis of safety application reliability metrics, ie, tracking error and collision risk, and conclude that there exists a unique beacon rate for which both the safety reliability metrics are minimized, and this optimal beacon rate is unique for varying vehicle densities. Tracking error is the difference between vehicle’s actual position and the perceived location of that vehicle by its neighbors (via most-recent beacons). A simple kinematics-based model is utilized to compute the vehicle collision risk. Furthermore, we analyze how well the two popular network performance metrics, Age of Information (AoI) and throughput, are able to indicate the safety application reliability metrics. Our experimentation shows that AoI-optimal rate has a strong correlation with the safetyoptimal rate, notwithstanding the vehicle densities, queuing sizes and queuing disciplines. Whereas throughput only works well under large vehicle density scenarios.","Scholar articles Experimental Analysis of Safety Performance in V2V networksB Choudhury, VK Shah, A Dayal, JH ReedRelated articles ","Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication networks enable safety applications via periodic broadcast of Basic Safety Messages (BSM) or beacons, that includes time-critical information such as, sender vehicle’s location, speed, and direction.
