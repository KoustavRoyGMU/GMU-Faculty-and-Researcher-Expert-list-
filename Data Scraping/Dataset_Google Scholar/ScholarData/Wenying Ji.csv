Intelligent approach to estimation of tunnel-induced ground settlement using wavelet packet and support vector machines,"Limao Zhang, Xianguo Wu, Wenying Ji, Simaan M AbouRizk",2017/3/1,Journal Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering,"This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach that integrates wavelet packet transformation (WPT) and least-squares support vector machines (LSSVMs) to enhance the accuracy and reliability regarding the estimation of tunnel-induced ground settlement on a daily basis. The original time-domain signal, measured settlements over a given time period, is decomposed into a series of sequences using WPT. LSSVM models are then built to predict the target sequences within high- and low-frequency regions. The predicted sequences are reconstructed to recover the estimated tunnel-induced ground settlement over time. Two indicators, mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), are proposed to illustrate the correspondence between individual pairs of model predictions and actual observations for performance analysis.

Rapid assessment of disaster impacts on highways using social media,"Yudi Chen, Qi Wang, Wenying Ji",2020/9/1,Journal Journal of Management in Engineering,"A timely and reliable assessment of disaster impacts on highways is desired for executing evacuations, providing emergency services, and planning relief and recovery activities in disaster management. Although social media—a near-real-time and human-centered information source—has been increasingly investigated to assess disaster impacts on communities, the employment of social media for assessing disaster impacts on highways is still less explored due to the lack of a systematic and reliable approach. To fill this gap, this research presents a social media–based approach to assess disaster impacts on highways. Two social media–based indicators, namely, the number of impact-related tweets (NIT) and the geolocation of impact-related tweets (GIT), are designed to indicate the severity and location of disaster impacts on highways, respectively.

Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo–based numerical approach for input model updating,"Lingzi Wu, Wenying Ji, Simaan M AbouRizk",2020/1/1,Journal Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering,"Stochastic, discrete-event simulation modeling has emerged as a useful tool for facilitating decision making in construction. Owing to the rigidity inherent to distribution-based inputs, current simulation models have difficulty incorporating new data in real-time, and fusing these data with subjective judgments. Accordingly, application of this valuable technique is often limited to project planning stages. To expand implementation of simulation-based decision-support systems to the execution phase, this research proposes the use of Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)–based numerical approximation approach as a universal input model updating methodology of stochastic simulation models for any given univariate continuous probability distribution.

Simulation-based dynamic adjustments of prices and subsidies for transportation PPP projects based on stakeholders’ satisfaction,"Jingfeng Yuan, Wenying Ji, Jiyue Guo, Mirosław J Skibniewski",2019/12/1,Journal Transportation,"Public–private partnership (PPP) has been well acknowledged by many as an innovative approach to the procurement of public projects. In their long-term concession periods, various uncertain factors lead to the difficulties in implementing the concession contracts. Historical projects have proven that unexpected changes of projects will inevitably result in the adjustment of prices of the private sector and subsidies from the public sector.

Assessing Disaster Impacts on Highways Using Social Media: Case Study of Hurricane Harvey,"Yudi Chen, Qi Wang, Wenying Ji",2020/11/9,Book Construction Research Congress 2020: Infrastructure Systems and Sustainability,"During and after disasters, highways provide vital routes for emergency services, relief efforts, and evacuation activities. Thus, a timely and reliable assessment of disaster impacts on highways is critical for decision-makers to quickly and effectively perform relief and recovery efforts. Recently, social media has increasingly been used in disaster management for obtaining a rapid, public-centric assessment of disaster impacts due to its near real-time, social, and informational characteristics. Although promising, the employment of social media for assessing disaster impacts on highways is still limited due to the inability of extracting accurate highway-related data from social media.

Enhancing situational assessment of critical infrastructure following disasters using social media,"Yudi Chen, Wenying Ji",2021/11/1,Journal Journal of Management in Engineering,"Social media, a near-real-time information source, has been widely used to provide timely infrastructure-related insights following disasters.

Intelligent data-driven approach for enhancing preliminary resource planning in industrial construction,"Lingzi Wu, Wenying Ji, Baoli Feng, Ulrich Hermann, Simaan AbouRizk",2021/10/1,Journal Automation in Construction,"Industrial construction is often fast-tracked, with engineering and construction phases progressing simultaneously. In contrast to projects where detailed engineering information is available prior to construction, fast-tracked projects rely on the subjective experience of practitioners to derive preliminary resource plans—often resulting in plans that fail to reflect true project design. Here, a data-driven approach for predicting module classes and preliminary resource requirements from historical resource data of similar modules is proposed. The approach deploys semi-supervised machine learning to categorize construction modules at a micro-level based on key design elements extracted from low level-of-detail 3D models.

Equipment logistics performance measurement using data-driven social network analysis,"Chang Liu, Wenying Ji, Simaan M AbouRizk, Ming-Fung Francis Siu",2019/3/14,Journal Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,"The construction industry relies heavily on the use of equipment. Equipment management for a single project is, in itself, challenging, and large contractors who want to achieve long-term success must also manage equipment at an intraorganizational level. While vast amounts of data are collected and updated dynamically to track equipment status within an organization, current practices do not consider these data during the decision-making process. Rather, companies often rely on a single metric, equipment utilization, for evaluating management performance. Inspired by the ability of social network analysis (SNA) to examine the interactions and relationships between objects, a SNA-based method for investigating equipment movement between project sites and equipment shops is proposed. This study proposes a novel performance metric, the direct dispatch index (DDI), which adds a distance weight to the …",8

While quite successful in controlling the spreading of COVID-19, there were voices against vaccines. Therefore, this research utilizes geo-tweets and Bayesian-based method to investigate public opinions towards vaccines based on (1) the spatiotemporal changes in public engagement and public sentiment; (2) how the public engagement and sentiment react to different vaccine-related topics; (3) how various races behave differently. We connected the phenomenon observed to real-time and historical events. We found that in general the public is positive towards COVID-19 vaccines.

Predicting Household Disaster Preparedness: An Integrated Machine Learning and Simulation Framework,"Zhenlong Jiang, Yudi Chen, Ting-Yeh Yang, Wenying Ji, Sasha Zhijie Dong, Ran Ji",2023/3/3,Publisher Preprints,"Effective household and individual disaster preparedness can minimize physical harm and property damage during catastrophic events. To assess the risk and vulnerability of affected areas, it is crucial for relief agencies to understand the level of public preparedness. Traditionally, government agencies have employed nationwide random telephone surveys to gauge the public’s attitudes and actions towards disaster preparedness. However, these surveys may lack generalizability in certain affected locations due to low response rates or areas not covered by the survey. To address this issue and enhance the comprehensiveness of disaster preparedness assessments, we develop a framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning and simulation. Our approach leverages machine learning algorithms to establish relationships between public attitudes towards disaster preparedness and demographic characteristics. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we generate datasets that incorporate demographic information of the affected location based on government-provided demographic distribution data. The generated dataset is then input into the machine learning model to predict the disaster preparedness attitudes of the affected population. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to Miami-Dade County, where it accurately predicts the level of disaster preparedness. With this innovative approach, relief agencies can have a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of public disaster preparedness.",

As infrastructure restoration progresses, Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo is applied to update the planned restoration progress. Based on the updated progress, earned schedule and Monte Carlo simulation are specialized to forecast the future restoration progress as well as considering restoration-associated uncertainties.

Discrete Event Simulation for Port Berth Maintenance Planning,"Ruqayah Alsayed Ebrahim, Shivanan Singh, Yitong Li, Wenying Ji",2022/12/9,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.04654,"Industrial and commercial ports, which are one of the three main hubs to the country, require 24/7 operations to maintain the goods export and import flow. Due to the aging and weather factors, berths require regular maintenance, such as replacing old piles, timber finders, marine ladders, rubber fenders, and deck slabs. For efficient berth maintenance, strategies are highly desired to minimize or eliminate any delays in operations during the maintenance. This paper develops a discrete event simulation model using Simphony.NET for berth maintenance processes in Doha Port, Kuwait. The model derives minimum maintenance duration under limited resources and associated uncertainties. The model can be used as a decision support tool to minimize interruption or delays in the port maintenance operations.",
Machine Learning and Simulation-Based Framework for Disaster Preparedness Prediction,"Zhenlong Jiang, Ran Ji, Yudi Chen, Wenying Ji",2021/12/12,Conference 2021 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC),"Sufficient preparedness is essential to community resilience following natural disasters. Understanding disaster preparedness of residents in the affected area improves the efficiency and equity of relief operations. This research aims to develop a machine learning and simulation-based approach to predict disaster preparedness using various demographic features from multisource data. The proposed approach comprises four steps: (1) collecting and integrating various data sources, including the FEMA National Household Survey data, US census data, and county-level disaster declaration data; (2) training multiple classification models with the prepared data set and selecting the model with best prediction performance; (3) simulating resident demographic features for at the county level; (4) predicting disaster preparedness status with simulated data for a selected county. A case study is presented to demonstrate …",
Public Demand Estimation Following Disasters Through Integrating Social Media and Community Demographics,"Yudi Chen, Wenying Ji",2021/12/12,Conference 2021 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC),"Following disasters, a timely and reliable estimation of public demand—the number of individuals having demand-is essential for allocating relief resources properly. However, such an estimation is challenging as public demand varies significantly in dynamic disasters. To address the challenge, this research estimates public demand through proposing a data-driven approach that integrates social media and community demographics. In detail, social media is used to derive the percentage of a population having demand, and demographics are applied to normalize population differences amongst races/ethnicities. The proposed approach is capable of (1) eliminating the social media bias caused by racial disparities on social media platforms, and (2) modeling the uncertainty of social media-derived demand percentage. Hurricane Irma-induced food demand in Florida is studied to prove the feasibility of the …",
