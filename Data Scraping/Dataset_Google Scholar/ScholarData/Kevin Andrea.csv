Swarm robot foraging with wireless sensor motes,"Katherine Russell, Michael Schader, Kevin Andrea, Sean Luke",2015/5/4,Book Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,"We investigate the use of wireless sensor motes as mobile deployable waypoints for swarm robot navigation in a foraging scenario. Each robot can deploy, retrieve, and optimize the location of the sensor motes. After deployment, the robots treat the sensor motes as nodes in a sparse graph, and store and retrieve multiple pheromones and flags locally in each of them. Pheromone information stored in the sensor motes allows the robots to build up gradients to different targets of interest, and to determine which sensor motes are good candidates to optimize location, or to harvest for reuse elsewhere. Unlike many earlier pheromone-based foraging techniques, our method must deal with the physical reality of deploying and manipulating sensor motes, including a limited mote supply both onboard and in total, robustly dealing with occlusion and interference from other robots, and handling noise and robot or mote failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique both on differential drive robots of our own design, and in simulation, to examine its ability to robustly deal with various failure modes and changes in environment.",15
Design and evaluation of an RPL-based multi-sink routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks,"Kevin Andrea, Robert Simon",2015/11/2,"Book Proceedings of the 18th ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems","Due to the energy and resource constraints of the embedded Wireless Sensor Networking (WSN) devices that form Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), efficient support for mobile data sinks is essential. Further, such support should be fully compatible with the broad class of networking mechanisms now defined for LLN support, such as the routing protocol RPL. This paper describes the Hierarchical network of Observable devices with Itinerant Sinks Transporting data (HOIST) protocol. HOIST is designed to service LLNs using an RPL-friendly three-tier hybrid cluster-tree architecture to support sensor nodes deployed over geographically segregated areas. The mobile aspects of HOIST allow for collection from such remote fields without the need for long-distance wireless transfers, which would result in a higher level of energy drain. HOIST supports both real-time data capture and collected data retrieval. We …",13
The Design and Implementation of a Multicast Address Moving Target Defensive System for Internet-of-Things Applications,"Kevin Andrea, Arda Gumusalan, Robert Simon, Hugh Harney",2017,Conference MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM),"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks serve to diminish the ability of the network to perform its intended function over time. The paper presents the design, implementation and analysis of a protocol based upon a technique for address agility called DDoS Resistant Multicast (DRM). After describing the our architecture and implementation we show an analysis that quantifies the overhead on network performance. We then present the Simple Agile RPL multiCAST (SARCAST), an Internet-of-Things routing protocol for DDoS protection. We have implemented and evaluated SARCAST in a working IoT operating system and testbed. Our results show that SARCAST provides very high levels of protection against DDoS attacks with virtually no impact on overall performance.",7
PANEL & ROUNDTABLE: Active Learning Strategies that Transcend Physical Space: Lessons from Across Disciplines (90 mins),"Laura Poms, Jessica Rosenberg, Jill Nelson, Kevin Andrea, Crystal Anderson, Alexandria Zylstra",2020/7/31,Journal Innovations in Teaching & Learning Conference Proceedings,"COVID-19 continues to challenge how instructors think about their teaching, work with their students and how to achieve effective learning. This session addresses these challenges and provides a variety of methods to overcome them, focusing on flexible techniques for encouraging student engagement that can be used across modalities (ie on-line, hybrid and face-to-face) and can be deployed quickly and easily if necessary. Participants are encouraged to bring their past and present active learning challenges. Faculty members from several disciplines across Mason, all actively engaged in implementing active learning, will discuss their recent efforts to continue to engage students in the face of the spring pivot to on-line learning. The session concludes with a hands-on workshop to help participants envision how they can take their current assignments and reimagine them with active learning strategies, with an eye towards pivot-proofing their course as much as possible.",
Supporting Mobile Swarm Robotics in Low Power and Lossy Sensor Networks,"Kevin Andrea, Robert Simon, Sean Luke",2016,"Description Wireless low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) are a key enabling technology for the deployment of massively scaled self-organizing sensor swarm systems. Supporting applications such as providing human users situational awareness across large areas requires that swarm-friendly LLNs effectively support communication between embedded and mobile devices, such as autonomous robots. The reason for this is that large scale embedded sensor applications such as unattended ground sensing systems typically do not have full end-to-end connectivity, but suffer frequent communication partitions. Further, it is desirable for many tactical applications to offload tasks to mobile robots. Despite the importance of support this communication pattern, there has been relatively little work in designing and evaluating LLN-friendly protocols capable of supporting such interactions.This paper addresses the above problem by describing the design, implementation, and evaluation of the MoRoMi system. MoRoMi stands for Mobile Robotic MultI-sink. It is intended to support autonomous mobile robots that interact with embedded sensor swarms engaged in activities such as cooperative target observation, collective map building, and ant foraging. These activities benefit if the swarm can dynamically interact with embedded sensing and actuator systems that provide both local environmental or positional information and an ad-hoc communication system. Our paper quantifies the performance levels that can be expected using current swarm and LLN technologies.","Wireless low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) are a key enabling technology for the deployment of massively scaled self-organizing sensor swarm systems.

"Design of Hierarchical, Mobile, Multi-Sink Routing for Low-Power and Lossy Networks",Kevin Andrea,2014,Institution George Mason University,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) devices are small, low-powered sensors that are deploy- able for long-periods of time to provide information on the local evironment to the world at large. These devices are designed to be deployed and operated for extended periods of time with a minimum amount of maintenance. These inexpensive devices open up a new  eld in computing, providing the ability for small groups to gather data on their environment for use in myriad tasks. This work presents the Hierarchical network of Observable devices with Itinerant Sinks Transporting data (HOIST), a WSN architecture I designed to alleviate the e ects of the disadvantages that lie within a WSN deployment. I began this design by dividing the traditional sender-sink model into a three-tier hierarchial model. This model separates the senders and the ultimate destination sink into tiers joined together by a series of bridging sinks. These bridging devices each control a smaller fragment of the collectors, enabling downward routing to a larger degree than otherwise possible with a traditional single DAG, while also coordinating the transmission of data between the collectors and the destination sink. Furthermore, HOIST adds in mobility to the model, allowing the highest tier sink to move about the deployment area, minimizing any set of bridging sinks from being the sole route burdened with relaying the messages of all of the devices on the network to the sink. This architecture further de nes the role of the bridges to coordinate their local collectors to send data one device at a time, enabling the expansion in network tra c to increase logarithmically with respect to the …",
