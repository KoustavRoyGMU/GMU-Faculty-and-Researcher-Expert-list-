Nanomaterial delivery systems for mRNA vaccines,"Michael D Buschmann, Manuel J Carrasco, Suman Alishetty, Mikell Paige, Mohamad Gabriel Alameh, Drew Weissman",2021/1/19,Source Vaccines,"The recent success of mRNA vaccines in SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials is in part due to the development of lipid nanoparticle delivery systems that not only efficiently express the mRNA-encoded immunogen after intramuscular injection, but also play roles as adjuvants and in vaccine reactogenicity. We present an overview of mRNA delivery systems and then focus on the lipid nanoparticles used in the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials. The review concludes with an analysis of the determinants of the performance of lipid nanoparticles in mRNA vaccines.",263

Design and synthesis of 1-aroyl-2-ylidene hydrazines under conventional and microwave irradiation conditions and their cytotoxic activities,"Lingam Venkata Reddy, Alishetty Suman, Syed Sultan Beevi, Lakshmi Narasu Mangamoori, Khagga Mukkanti, Sarbani Pal",2010,Journal Journal of the Brazilian Chemical Society,"We report the design and synthesis of 1-aroyl-2-(alkenyl/aryl)idene hydrazines as hybrid molecules derived from mefenamic acid and substituted hydrazones. A number of compounds based on this new scaffold were prepared in good yields. The key intermediate N-acylhydrazine, prepared from mefenamic acid, was coupled with a variety of aldehydes under conventional as well as microwave irradiation conditions. The second approach, that requires short reaction time, can be carried out under a solvent free condition and does not require the use of an acid catalyst or solid support. Some of the compounds synthesized showed cytotoxic activities in vitro.",25
Chain-growth cationic polymerization of 2-halogenated thiophenes promoted by Brønsted acids,"Arumugam Balasubramanian, Ting-Chia Ku, Hong-Pin Shih, Alishetty Suman, Huang-Jyun Lin, Ting-Wen Shih, Chien-Chung Han",2014,Journal Polymer Chemistry,"Brønsted acids are found to be effective and generally applicable catalysts for inducing the cationic chain-growth polymerization of a wide variety of 2-halogenated-3-substituted-thiophenes with hydrogen, alkyl, alkylthio, alkoxy, and dialkoxy substituent groups. The effectiveness of the cationic polymerization depends on the acid strength and the electron density of the 2-halothiophene monomer. For the most electron-rich monomer, like EDOT, the polymerization can be initiated essentially with any acid that is stronger than acetic acid. While for the electron-poor 2-bromothiophene, it only works with the strongest acid, e.g., trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. Using this new polymerization method, highly solution-processable and conductive poly(alkylthiothiophene)s with a conductivity greater than 180 S cm−1 can be conveniently prepared. Control experiments indicate that Lewis acid like BF3 and SnCl4 (0.5 equiv.) can …",20
Skipped dienes in natural product synthesis,"Greg Petruncio, Zachary Shellnutt, Synah Elahi-Mohassel, Suman Alishetty, Mikell Paige",2021,Source Natural Product Reports,"Covering: 2000–2020       The 1,4-diene motif, also known as a skipped diene, is widespread across various classes of natural products including alkaloids, fatty acids, terpenoids, and polyketides as part of either the finalized structure or a biosynthetic intermediate. The prevalence of this nonconjugated diene system in nature has resulted in numerous encounters in the total synthesis literature. However, skipped dienes have not been extensively reviewed, which could be attributed to overshadowing by the more recognized 1,3-diene system. In this review, we aim to highlight the relevance of skipped dienes in natural products through the lens of total synthesis. Subjects that will be covered include nomenclature, structural properties, prevalence in natural products, synthetic strategies and the future direction of the field.",19
"One-step, effective, and cascade syntheses of highly functionalized cyclopentenes with high diastereoselectivity","Suman Alishetty, Hong-Pin Shih, Chien-Chung Han",2018/4/17,Journal Organic letters,"Tetrabutylammonium fluoride works as an effective organocatalyst for the cycloaddition between phenacylmalononitriles and electron-deficient olefins (having substituent groups of NO2, CHO, and COR), providing a facile synthetic route to versatile multifunctionalized cyclopentenes having an allylic quaternary carbon center bearing both cyano and carboxamide groups with high yields and high diastereoselectivity. Preliminary studies reveal that these functionalized cyclopentenes are convenient precursors for making α-cyano-functionalized cyclopentadienone oximes.",19
Synthesis of novel quinoline analogues of nimesulide: An unusual observation,"Lingam Venkata Reddy, Mamatha Nakka, Alishetty Suman, Soumen Ghosh, Madeleine Helliwell, Khagga Mukkanti, Alok Kumar Mukherjee, Sarbani Pal",2011/5,Journal Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry,"Reduction of nimesulide followed by treating the N‐acyl derivative of resulting arylamine with Vilsmeier‐Haack reagent provided novel 2‐chloro‐3‐formylquinoline derivatives. The construction of quinoline ring using Vilsmeier‐Haack reagent afforded an unexpected compound, N‐(2‐chloro‐3‐formyl‐7‐phenoxy quinolin‐6‐yl)formamide, in addition to the expected product. The structure of this unexpected quinoline derivative was established via single‐crystal X‐ray analysis and its formation could be explained by an unprecedented N‐S bond cleavage under Vilsmeier‐Haack reaction conditions. The 2‐chloro‐3‐formylquinoline derivatives obtained were converted to a number of corresponding Schiff bases with potential pharmacological importance. J. Heterocyclic Chem., 2011.",14
"Novel lipid nanoparticle provides potent SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine at low dose with low local reactogenicity, high thermostability and limited systemic biodistribution","Suman Alishetty, Manuel Carrasco, Mohamad-Gabriel Alameh, Mikell Paige, Hooda Said, Lacey Wright, Aarthi Narayanan, Farhang Alem, Keziah Hernandez, Patrick Gillevet, Ousamah Soliman, Philip Hicks, Tomaz Manzoni, Paul Bates, Alisa Stephens-Shields, Thomas Cleveland, Alexander Grishaev, Drew Weissman, Michael Buschmann",2021/8/17,"Description Concerns with current mRNA Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) systems include dose-limiting reactogenicity, adverse events that may be partly due to systemic off target expression of the immunogen, and a very limited understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the frozen storage requirement. We applied a new rational design process to identify a novel multiprotic ionizable lipid, called C24, as the key component of the mRNA LNP delivery system. We show that the resulting C24 LNP has a multistage protonation behavior resulting in greater endosomal protonation and greater translation of an mRNA-encoded luciferase reporter after intramuscular (IM) administration compared to the standard reference MC3 LNP. Off-target expression in liver after IM administration was reduced 6 fold for the C24 LNP compared to MC3. Neutralizing titers in immunogenicity studies delivering a nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding for the diproline stabilized spike protein immunogen were 10 fold higher for the C24 LNP versus MC3, and protection against viral challenge in a SARS-CoV-2 mouse model occurred at a very low 0.25 µg prime/boost dose of the same immunogen in the C24 LNP. Injection site inflammation was notably reduced for C24 compared to MC3. In addition, we found the C24 LNP to be entirely stable in bioactivity and mRNA integrity when stored at 4 ºC for at least 19 days.

Mxene-based Disposable Sensors,"Puchakayala Swetha, Suman Alishetty, Yaamini Mohan",2021/4/29,Book Disposable Electrochemical Sensors for Healthcare Monitoring,"Mxenes, an emerging class of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials comprising transition metal carbides or nitrides (Ti3C2Tx), have been investigated because of their excellent electrical conductivities, large specific surface area, unique electrochemical properties and impressive tensile strengths. They have attracted the broader scientific community and have opened up a plethora of applications such as electrochemical sensors, solar cells, and catalysis and energy storage. It is crucial to study how the synthetic procedures and surface functionalizations affect the diversity of Mxenes performance, modularity and their chemical, thermal and physical properties. Interestingly, the distinctive electrochemical redox characteristics make Mxenes a powerful platform for excellent biosensors. Electrode modification is a crucial part of the sensor because it is the sole deciding factor for high selectivity, sensitivity …",1
UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) activity is suppressed by peroxide and promoted by PDGF in fibroblast-like synoviocytes: Evidence of a redox control mechanism,"Ramya Chandrasekaran, Colleen Mathieu, Rishi Sheth, Alexandre P Cheng, David Fong, Robert McCormack, Hani El-Gabalawy, Suman Alishetty, Mikell Paige, Caroline D Hoemann",2022/9/15,Journal Plos one,"UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) generates essential precursors of hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis, however mechanisms regulating its activity are unclear. We used enzyme histostaining and quantitative image analysis to test whether cytokines that stimulate HA synthesis upregulate UGDH activity. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS, from N = 6 human donors with knee pain) were cultured, freeze-thawed, and incubated for 1 hour with UDP-glucose, NAD+ and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) which allows UGDH to generate NADH, and NADH to reduce NBT to a blue stain. Compared to serum-free medium, FLS treated with PDGF showed 3-fold higher UGDH activity and 6-fold higher HA release, but IL-1beta/TGF-beta1 induced 27-fold higher HA release without enhancing UGDH activity. In selected proliferating cells, UGDH activity was lost in the cytosol, but preserved in the nucleus. Cell-free assays led us to discover that diaphorase, a cytosolic enzyme, or glutathione reductase, a nuclear enzyme, was necessary and sufficient for NADH to reduce NBT to a blue formazan dye in a 1-hour timeframe. Primary synovial fibroblasts and transformed A549 fibroblasts showed constitutive diaphorase/GR staining activity that varied according to supplied NADH levels, with relatively stronger UGDH and diaphorase activity in A549 cells. Unilateral knee injury in New Zealand White rabbits (N = 3) stimulated a coordinated increase in synovial membrane UGDH and diaphorase activity, but higher synovial fluid HA in only 2 out of 3 injured joints. UGDH activity (but not diaphorase) was abolished by N-ethyl maleimide, and inhibited by peroxide or UDP-xylose …",

NMR Measurement of pKa of Nitrogen Groups,"Andrea Matten, Suman Alishetty, Mikell Paige Mikell Paige, Michael Buschmann",2019/11/19,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Messenger RNA has recently attracted great interest due to in vivo evidence of high efficacy in vaccine and cancer applications. A delivery system is required for the mRNA to protect it from enzymatic attack and facilitate cellular entry and intracellular release and translation of the payload. Currently, solid Lipid NanoParticles (LNPs) are the most effective delivery system for mRNA. Studies to date have revealed that the ionization behavior of the nitrogen-containing cationic lipid in LNPs is key to intracellular release. Direct measurement of pKa of the cationic lipids has not been reported to date but would be helpful in the rational design of novel systems. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has proven to be advantageous in determining the pKa of these lipids because it can measure mixtures with impurities, as mole fractions are used instead of acid concentration.
