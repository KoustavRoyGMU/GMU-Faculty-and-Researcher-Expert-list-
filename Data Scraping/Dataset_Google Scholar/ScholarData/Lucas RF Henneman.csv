Bayesian belief networks for predicting drinking water distribution system pipe breaks,"Royce A Francis, Seth D Guikema, Lucas Henneman",2014/10/1,Journal Reliability Engineering & System Safety,"In this paper, we use Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to construct a knowledge model for pipe breaks in a water zone. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to model drinking water distribution system pipe breaks using BBNs. Development of expert systems such as BBNs for analyzing drinking water distribution system data is not only important for pipe break prediction, but is also a first step in preventing water loss and water quality deterioration through the application of machine learning techniques to facilitate data-based distribution system monitoring and asset management. Due to the difficulties in collecting, preparing, and managing drinking water distribution system data, most pipe break models can be classified as “statistical–physical” or “hypothesis-generating.” We develop the BBN with the hope of contributing to the “hypothesis-generating” class of models, while demonstrating the possibility …",108
Evaluating the effectiveness of air quality regulations: A review of accountability studies and frameworks,"Lucas RF Henneman, Cong Liu, James A Mulholland, Armistead G Russell",2017/2/1,Source Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,"Assessments of past environmental policies—termed accountability studies—contribute important information to the decision-making process used to review the efficacy of past policies, and subsequently aid in the development of effective new policies. These studies have used a variety of methods that have achieved varying levels of success at linking improvements in air quality and/or health to regulations. The Health Effects Institute defines the air pollution accountability framework as a chain of events that includes the regulation of interest, air quality, exposure/dose, and health outcomes, and suggests that accountability research should address impacts for each of these linkages. Early accountability studies investigated short-term, local regulatory actions (for example, coal use banned city-wide on a specific date or traffic pattern changes made for Olympic Games). Recent studies assessed regulations …",82
A policy review of synergies and trade-offs in South African climate change mitigation and air pollution control strategies,"Carmen Klausbruckner, Harold Annegarn, Lucas RF Henneman, Peter Rafaj",2016/3/1,Source Environmental Science & Policy,"Climate change mitigation and air quality management are mostly addressed separately in South African legal acts and policies. This approach is not always coherent, especially in the context of other serious issues South Africa is facing, such as poverty alleviation. Policies implemented to mitigate climate change might increase negative health affects due to unanticipated outcomes (e.g. increased local air pollution), and these indirect consequences must therefore be taken into account when devising mitigation strategies. However, greenhouse gas mitigation policies can also have co-benefits and positive impacts on local air pollution. An evidence-based approach that takes into account greenhouse gas emissions, ambient air pollutants, economic factors (affordability, cost optimisation), social factors (poverty alleviations, public health benefits), and political acceptability is needed tackle these challenges.

Meteorological detrending of primary and secondary pollutant concentrations: Method application and evaluation using long-term (2000–2012) data in Atlanta,"Lucas RF Henneman, Heather A Holmes, James A Mulholland, Armistead G Russell",2015/10/1,Journal Atmospheric Environment,"The effectiveness of air pollution regulations and controls are evaluated based on measured air pollutant concentrations. Air pollution levels, however, are highly sensitive to both emissions and meteorological fluctuations. Therefore, an assessment of the change in air pollutant levels due to emissions controls must account for these meteorological fluctuations. Two empirical methods to quantify the impact of meteorology on pollutant levels are discussed and applied to the 13-year time period between 2000 and 2012 in Atlanta, GA. The methods employ Kolmogorov–Zurbenko filters and linear regressions to detrended pollutant signals into long-term, seasonal, weekly, short-term, and white-noise components. The methods differ in how changes in weekly and holiday emissions are accounted for. Both can provide meteorological adjustments on a daily basis for future use in acute health analyses.",56

Assessing emissions levels and costs associated with climate and air pollution policies in South Africa,"Lucas RF Henneman, Peter Rafaj, Harold J Annegarn, Carmen Klausbruckner",2016/2/1,Journal Energy Policy,"Affordable energy supply and reductions in emissions of local air pollution and greenhouse gases are each important aspects of South Africa's goals. Many traditional solutions, however, work in contradiction to one another. This work investigates effects on estimated emissions and costs of mitigation strategies using the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interaction Synergies (GAINS) model to identify policies that satisfy multiple goals. Eight scenarios that describe air pollution control options and mixes of energy production technologies are implemented in GAINS, which quantifies country-wide air pollution and greenhouse emissions and costs of controls. Emissions and costs trajectories are compared to the business as usual case, which projects CO2 emissions to increase by 60% by 2050 compared to 2015.

Characterizing population exposure to coal emissions sources in the United States using the HyADS model,"Lucas RF Henneman, Christine Choirat, Cesunica Ivey, Kevin Cummiskey, Corwin M Zigler",2019/4/15,Journal Atmospheric Environment,"In anticipation of the expanding appreciation for air quality models in health outcomes studies, we develop and evaluate a reduced-complexity model for pollution transport that intentionally sacrifices some of the sophistication of full-scale chemical transport models in order to support applicability to a wider range of health studies. Specifically, we introduce the HYSPLIT average dispersion model, HyADS, which combines the HYSPLIT trajectory dispersion model with modern advances in parallel computing to estimate ZIP code level exposure to emissions from individual coal-powered electricity generating units in the United States. Importantly, the method is not designed to reproduce ambient concentrations of any particular air pollutant; rather, the primary goal is to characterize each ZIP code's exposure to these coal power plants specifically.

"Air quality modeling for accountability research: Operational, dynamic, and diagnostic evaluation","Lucas RF Henneman, Cong Liu, Yongtao Hu, James A Mulholland, Armistead G Russell",2017/10/1,Journal Atmospheric environment,"Photochemical grid models play a central role in air quality regulatory frameworks, including in air pollution accountability research, which seeks to demonstrate the extent to which regulations causally impacted emissions, air quality, and public health. There is a need, however, to develop and demonstrate appropriate practices for model application and evaluation in an accountability framework. We employ a combination of traditional and novel evaluation techniques to assess four years (2001-02, 2011-12) of simulated pollutant concentrations across a decade of major emissions reductions using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. We have grouped our assessments in three categories: Operational evaluation investigates how well CMAQ captures absolute concentrations; dynamic evaluation investigates how well CMAQ captures changes in concentrations across the decade of changing …",29

Empirical development of ozone isopleths: Applications to Los Angeles,"Yu Qian, Lucas RF Henneman, James A Mulholland, Armistead G Russell",2019/4/11,Journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters,"Understanding quantitative relationships between ambient ozone concentrations and precursor emissions is important to policymakers and stakeholders. Such relationships are often captured as ozone isopleth diagrams developed using air quality models. Model-based approaches have limitations, including errors stemming from uncertainties in inputs and modeled processes, and can be computationally burdensome. We develop and apply an empirical method based on ozone design values calculated in the South Coast Air Basin, California, for 1975–2016 to construct ozone isopleths. The study domain is the area with the highest ozone levels in the United States that has experienced high levels of emissions control.

Their residential energy use mix (REM) and pollutant emission profiles are different from those of traditional urban (URs) and rural residents (RRs). Their migration towards urban areas plays an important role in shaping the magnitudes and spatial patterns of pollutant emissions, ambient PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 μm) concentrations, and associated health impacts in both urban and rural areas. Here we evaluate the impacts of RMW migration on REM pollutant emissions, ambient PM2.5, and subsequent premature deaths across China. At the national scale, RMW migration benefits ambient air quality because RMWs tend to transition to a cleaner REM upon arrival at urban areas—though not as clean as urban residents'.

Air pollution accountability of energy transitions: the relative importance of point source emissions and wind fields in exposure changes,"Lucas RF Henneman, Loretta J Mickley, Corwin M Zigler",2019/10/29,Journal Environmental Research Letters,"Recent studies have sought epidemiological evidence of the effectiveness of energy transitions. Such evidence often relies on so-called'natural experiments', wherein environmental and/or health outcomes are assessed before, during, and after the transition of interest. Often, these studies attribute air pollution exposure changes—either modeled or measured—directly to the transition. We formalize a framework for separating the fractions of a given exposure change attributable to meteorological variability and emissions changes. Using this framework, we quantify relative impacts of wind variability and emissions changes from coal-fired power plants on exposure to  emissions across the United States under three unique combinations of spatial-temporal and source scales.

In particular, recent evidence suggests that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with chemical tracers suggesting coal combustion origins is especially harmful. Augmenting this knowledge with estimates from causal inference methods to identify the health impacts of PM2.5 derived from specific point sources of coal combustion would be an important step towards informing specific, targeted interventions. We investigated the effect of high-exposure to coal combustion emissions from 783 coal-fired power generating units on ischemic heart disease (IHD) hospitalizations in over 19 million Medicare beneficiaries residing at 21,351 ZIP codes in the eastern United States. We used InMAP, a newly-developed, reduced-complexity air quality model to classify each ZIP code as either a high-exposed or control location. Our health outcomes analysis uses a causal inference method - propensity score matching - to adjust for potential confounders of the relationship between exposure and IHD. We fit separate Poisson regression models to the matched data in each geographic region to estimate the incidence rate ratio for IHD comparing high-exposed to control locations.

Our approach allows for rigorous confounding adjustment with highly spatio-temporally resolved effect estimates. We find that, with the exception of the Southwest, most of the US experienced increases in PM 2.5 compared to concentrations expected under business-as-usual. To investigate possible drivers of this phenomenon, we use a regression model to characterize the relationship of various factors with the observed impacts.

We examined the extent of air pollution reduction that was attained under these extreme circumstances, whether these reductions occurred everywhere in the US, and the local factors that drove them. Employing counterfactual time series analysis based on seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, we found that these extreme lockdown measures led to a reduction in the weekly PM2.5 average by up to 3.4 µg m-3 and the weekly NO2 average by up to 11 ppb. These values represent a substantial fraction of the annual mean NAAQS values of 12 µg m-3 and 53 ppb, respectively. We found evidence of a statistically significant decline in NO2 concentrations following the state-level emergency declaration in almost all states. However, statistically significant declines in PM2.5 occurred mostly in the West Coast and the Northeast. Certain states experienced a decline in NO2 but an increase in PM2.5 concentrations, indicating that these two pollutants arise from dissimilar sources in these states. Finally, we found evidence that states with a higher percentage of mobile source emissions prior to the emergency measures experienced a greater decline in NO2 levels during the pandemic.

Reductions, however, have not been spatially uniform or linear with emissions reductions, and therefore motivate an investigation into spatial and source-specific O3 production efficiency (OPE). OPE is a measure of the number of O3 molecules produced per emitted NOX (NOX = NO + NO2) molecule. We assess OPE using both model-based and empirical approaches. We modelled July OPE in 2001 and 2011 using CMAQ-DDM version 5.0 with a 12 km resolution over the eastern US. CMAQ-modelled OPE is taken as a ratio of electricity generating …",1

Trends in air pollution emissions in the contiguous United States from 1970 to 2010: an environmental justice analysis,"Yanelli Nunez, Jaime Benavides, Misbath Daouda, Lucas RF Henneman, Randall V Martin, Erin E McDuffie, Jeff Goldsmith, Joan A Casey, Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou",2022/9/18,Journal ISEE Conference Abstracts," Background: Air pollution emissions have substantially decreased in the US since the 1970 Clean Air Act. We examined racial and economic disparities in emissions reductions from specific pollution sources.  Methods: We evaluated racial/ethnic and economic disparities in emissions reductions from six pollution sectors [industry (SO2), energy (SO2), agriculture (NH3), commercial (NOx), residential (organic carbon), and on-road transport (NOx)] across the contiguous US from 1970–2010. We used the CEDGBD-MAP emissions inventory to estimate the average relative emissions change from one decennial to the following and its link to demographics (percent White, Black, Asian, American Indian Hispanic, family income, property value, poverty, and unemployment) at the county level. We constructed hierarchical models with the relative emissions change as the dependent variable and demographics as …",
Racial/ethnic disparities in nationwide PM2. 5 exposure: perils of assuming a linear relationship,"Misbath Daouda, Lucas Henneman, Jeff Goldsmith, Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, Joan A Casey",2022/9/18,Journal ISEE Conference Abstracts," BACKGROUND AND AIM  Studies of racial/ethnic disparities in air pollution exposure assume an equal magnitude of disparity across the demographic distribution, which may under- or over-estimate the true disparity. Further, historic practices such as racist zoning policies could plausibly drive non-linear relationships between racial/ethnic composition and air pollution exposure. We aimed to conduct a nationwide analysis in urban areas allowing for non-linearity in the relationship between racial/ethnic composition and ambient particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM₂.₅), and test whether racial segregation modified this relationship.    METHODS  We obtained tract-level demographic information from the 2010 Census and computed the multi-group dissimilarity index, a metropolitan-area level measure of racial segregation. Ambient PM₂.₅ data was obtained from a publicly available source. We …",
The impact of coal and oil power plants retirements on air pollution and cardiorespiratory health in California: an application of generalized synthetic control design,"Chen Chen, Sindana Ilango, Lucas Henneman, Joan Casey, Tarik Benmarhnia",2022/9/18,Journal ISEE Conference Abstracts," Background and Aim:  Evidence documenting the harmful consequences of ambient air pollution can be advanced by examining the effect of well-defined interventions on air pollution and possible benefits on health outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the effect of coal and oil facility retirements, on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and cardiorespiratory hospitalizations in California. Methods:  We identified 15 coal and oil facilities in California that retired between January 1st, 2006 and December 31st, 2013 and estimated the effect of facility retirements with a generalized synthetic control design. We classified California zip codes as exposed or unexposed to a facility retirement using emissions information and a dispersion model. We then estimated the difference in weekly average PM2.5 concentrations and cardiorespiratory hospitalization rate after each facility retirement between the exposed zip codes and the …",

Forty years of road transport NOX emissions reductions in the contiguous United States: an environmental justice analysis,"Yanelli Nunez, Jaime Benavides, Mistbath Daouda, Lucas Henneman, Erin E Mcduffle, Randall V Martin, Joan Casey, Jeff Goldsmith, Marianthi Anna Kioumourtzoglou",2021/8/23,Journal ISEE Conference Abstracts," BACKGROUND AND AIM: Road transport-related nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions in the United States (US) were drastically reduced over the last forty years. These improvements were mainly driven by environmental policies aiming to reduce emissions and, consequently, exposure to air pollutants. Prior research has identified inequalities in air pollution exposures in the US but, to our knowledge, no studies have evaluated potential disparities in emissions reductions across the country. We aim to describe the nationwide distribution of NOX emission reductions from 1970 to 2010 by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. METHODS: We conducted analyses at the county level from 1970 to 2010 across the contiguous US. We used annual NOX transport emissions estimated by a global emissions inventory model at 50km2 grid resolution, which we aggregated to area-weighted county averages. We obtained …",

Posterior predictive treatment assignment methods for causal inference in the context of time-varying treatments,"Shirley X Liao, Lucas Henneman, Cory Zigler",2020/1/1,Journal Epidemiologic Methods,"Marginal structural models (MSM) with inverse probability weighting (IPW) are used to estimate causal effects of time-varying treatments, but can result in erratic finite-sample performance when there is low overlap in covariate distributions across different treatment patterns. Modifications to IPW which target the average treatment effect (ATE) estimand either introduce bias or rely on unverifiable parametric assumptions and extrapolation. This paper extends an alternate estimand, the ATE on the overlap population (ATO) which is estimated on a sub-population with a reasonable probability of receiving alternate treatment patterns in time-varying treatment settings. To estimate the ATO within an MSM framework, this paper extends a stochastic pruning method based on the posterior predictive treatment assignment (PPTA) (Zigler, C. M., and M.

Google Maps Location History Data has Great Potentials for Improving Exposure Estimation for Air Pollution Health Studies,"Haofei Yu, Cesunica Ivey, Lucas Henneman",2019/12,Journal AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,"Capturing individual spatiotemporal mobility is important for accurately estimating human exposure to ambient air pollution. However, detailed data on individual mobility is difficult to collect, particularly for retrospective health studies. Google Maps is one of the most used smartphone apps worldwide, and it will continuously collect location data from the smartphone when its"" Location History"" feature is enabled. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of the Google Maps Location History (GMLH) data in capturing individual mobility for pollution exposure estimation purposes. One subject carried a smartphone installed with Google Maps and a standalone GPS recorder for one week. The retrieved GMLH data were then compared with the reference GPS data to evaluate its accuracy in capturing individual mobility. We found the GMLH data accurately captured the spatial movement of the subject during the week at up …",

Air pollution accountability: Assessing regulatory impacts on emissions and air quality,Lucas Richard Fath Henneman,2017/7/19,Institution Georgia Institute of Technology,"The United States has seen large improvements in air quality over the last half century with the implementation of regulations designed to reduce air pollutant emissions. Regulatory costs, estimated by the Environmental Protection Agency at tens of billions of dollars per year, motivate air pollution accountability research, which evaluates impacts of air quality regulations on emissions, air quality, exposure/dose, and public health—components of the so-called Accountability Chain. This work adds to the expanding air pollution accountability field by investigating a range of regulatory actions on electricity generating units and on-road mobile sources promulgated since the 1990s. Results show that the United States has seen major emissions reductions over this period, and most of the decreases are attributable to regulatory policies, although influences such as fuel costs, demographic shifts, and technological improvements have influenced emissions reductions as well. The bulk of this work investigates the impacts of changing emissions on air quality in the Eastern United States. Analyses focus on ambient ozone and particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), two pollutants linked with adverse health and environmental impacts. Observation-based statistical models and a deterministic air quality model (the Community Multiscale Air Quality model—CMAQ) show that emissions reduction programs reduced the highest ozone concentrations while simultaneously increasing the lowest concentrations. For PM2.5, controls reduced both the annual mean values and the variability. Meteorology had large impacts on daily pollutant …",
Estimating the Impact of Air Pollution Controls on Ambient Concentrations,"Lucas RF Henneman, Cong Liu, David Lavoué, Howard Chang, James A Mulholland, Armistead G Russell",2016,Conference Air Pollution Modeling and its Application XXIV,"This work describes the development and application of a statistical model that links electricity generating unit (EGU) and mobile source emissions with a city center monitoring cite. The model uses estimated emissions and measured concentrations over the period 2000–2012 in Atlanta, GA, USA to develop counterfactual time series of daily ozone concentrations. Further, the model estimates the sensitivity of observed ozone to each emissions sector. Results show that emissions control policies have had little effect on annual median ozone, have decreased 90th percentile ozone, and have increased 10th percentile ozone. Sensitivities to EGU and mobile emissions are compared and agree well with similar sensitivities calculated using a first-principles chemical transport model. ",
