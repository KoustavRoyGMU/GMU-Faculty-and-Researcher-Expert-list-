Review of robotic infrastructure inspection systems,"David Lattanzi, Gregory Miller",2017/9/1,Source Journal of Infrastructure Systems,"In order to minimize the costs, risks, and disruptions associated with structural inspections, robotic systems have increasingly been studied as an enhancement to current inspection practices. Combined with the increasing variety of commercially available robots, the last two decades have seen dramatic growth in the application of such systems. The use of these systems spans the breadth of civil infrastructure works, and the variety of implemented robotic systems is growing rapidly. However, the highly interdisciplinary nature of research in this field means that results are disseminated across a broad variety of publications. This review paper aggregates these studies in an effort to distill the state of the art in inspection robotics, as well as to assess outstanding challenges in the field and possibilities for the future. Overall, analysis of these studies illustrates that the design of inspection robots is often a case-specific …",172
Unmanned aerial vehicle inspection of the Placer River Trail Bridge through image-based 3D modelling,"Ali Khaloo, David Lattanzi, Keith Cunningham, Rodney Dell’Andrea, Mark Riley",2018/1/2,Journal Structure and Infrastructure Engineering,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are now a viable option for augmenting bridge inspections. Utilising an integrated combination of a UAV and computer vision can decrease costs, expedite inspections and facilitate bridge access. Any such inspection must consider the design of the UAV, the choice of cameras, data acquisition, geometrical resolution, safety regulations and pilot protocols. The Placer River Trail Bridge in Alaska recently served as a test bed for a UAV inspection methodology that integrates these considerations. The end goal was to produce a three-dimensional (3D) model of the bridge using UAV-captured images and a hierarchical Dense Structure-from-Motion algorithm. To maximise the quality of the model and its benefits to inspectors, this goal guided UAV design and mission planning. The resulting inspection methodology integrates UAV design, data capture and data analysis together to …",161
Robust automated concrete damage detection algorithms for field applications,"David Lattanzi, Gregory R Miller",2014/3/1,Journal Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering,"This paper presents a computer vision framework supporting automated infrastructure damage detection, with a specific focus on surface crack detection in concrete. The approach presented is designed to provide a significant increase in robustness relative to existing methods when faced with widely varying field conditions while operating fast enough to be used in large scale applications. In particular, a clustering method for segmentation is developed that exploits inherent characteristics of fracture images to achieve consistent performance, combined with robust feature extraction to improve recognition algorithm classifier outcomes. The approach is shown to perform well in detecting cracks across a broad range of surface and lighting conditions, which can cause existing techniques to exhibit significant reductions in detection accuracy and/or detection speed.",71
Robust normal estimation and region growing segmentation of infrastructure 3D point cloud models,"Ali Khaloo, David Lattanzi",2017/10/1,Journal Advanced Engineering Informatics,"Modern remote sensing technologies such as three-dimensional (3D) laser scanners and image-based 3D scene reconstruction are in increasing demand for applications in civil infrastructure design, maintenance, operation, and as-built construction verification. The complex nature of the 3D point clouds these technologies generate, as well as the often massive scale of the 3D data, make it inefficient and time consuming to manually analyze and manipulate point clouds, and highlights the need for automated analysis techniques. This paper presents one such technique, a new region growing algorithm for the automated segmentation of both planar and non-planar surfaces in point clouds. A core component of the algorithm is a new point normal estimation method, an essential task for many point cloud processing algorithms.

3D scene reconstruction for robotic bridge inspection,"David Lattanzi, Gregory R Miller",2015/6/1,Journal Journal of Infrastructure Systems,"This paper provides a comparative study of two methods for reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) scenes from monocular two-dimensional (2D) images with respect to their applicability to robotic civil infrastructure inspection. The two methods considered are dense structure from motion (DSfM) and image mosaicing (IM). The primary metrics used in the comparison include: (1) the accuracy of the reconstructions for inspection measurement purposes, (2) the nature and prevalence of reconstruction artifacts, and (3) resolution demands for adequate reconstruction accuracy. A series of small-scale model reconstructions using both approaches were developed and compared. Findings from the small-scale tests were then applied to a full-scale field test of the robotic reconstruction system. Both methods generally produced geometrically accurate reconstructions, but the DSfM method was found to be more adaptable to …",58
Utilizing UAV and 3D computer vision for visual inspection of a large gravity dam,"Ali Khaloo, David Lattanzi, Adam Jachimowicz, Charles Devaney",2018,Journal Frontiers in Built Environment,"Dams are a critical infrastructure system for many communities, but they are also one of the most challenging to inspect. Dams are typically very large and complex structures, and the result is that inspections are often time-intensive and require expensive, specialized equipment and training to provide inspectors with comprehensive access to the structure. The scale and nature of dam inspections also introduces additional safety risks to the inspectors. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have the potential to address many of these challenges, particularly when used as a data acquisition platform for photogrammetric three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and analysis, though the nature of both UAV and modern photogrammetric methods necessitates careful planning and coordination for integration. This paper presents a case study on one such integration at the Brighton Dam, a large-scale concrete gravity dam in Maryland, USA. A combination of multiple UAV platforms and multi-scale photogrammetry was used to create two comprehensive and high-resolution 3D point clouds of the dam and surrounding environment at intervals. These models were then assessed for their overall quality, as well as their ability to resolve flaws and defects that were artificially applied to the structure between inspection intervals. The results indicate that the integrated process is capable of generating models that accurately render a variety of defect types with sub-millimeter accuracy. Recommendations for mission planning and imaging specifications are provided as well.",56
Hierarchical dense structure-from-motion reconstructions for infrastructure condition assessment,"Ali Khaloo, David Lattanzi",2017/1/1,Journal Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering,"Accurate condition assessment of in-service infrastructure systems is critical for system-wide prioritization decisions.

Measures of the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete buildings in Haiti,"Patrick O'Brien, Marc Eberhard, Olafur Haraldsson, Ayhan Irfanoglu, David Lattanzi, Steven Lauer, Santiago Pujol",2011/10,Journal Earthquake Spectra,"Following the 12 January 2010 Haiti earthquake, teams of students and faculty members from the United States and Haiti surveyed 170 reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Port-au-Prince and Léogâne. This paper summarizes the survey results and compares them with results from a similar survey done after the 1999 earthquakes near Düzce, Turkey. The survey results demonstrate that the frequency of damage in RC buildings was higher in Haiti than in Turkey. This increased level of damage is consistent with practical screening criteria based on cross-sectional areas of building columns and walls. Based on these criteria, 90% of the structures surveyed in Haiti would have been classified as seismically vulnerable before the earthquake. Damage was more frequent in structures with captive columns. A two-tiered screening process is suggested to rapidly assess the vulnerability of scores of poorly built low-rise …",43

The primary objective of the associated study was to determine if there is a statistically robust relationship between peak seismic displacement and damage observations extracted from two-dimensional (2D) images captured after an event. To this end, correlations were developed using images and experimental test data from lateral-load tests performed on a series of reinforced concrete bridge columns. Computer vision algorithms based on a combination of image segmentation, feature extraction, and nonlinear regression analysis were used to estimate peak drift.

Bridge type classification: Supervised learning on a modified NBI data set,"Achyuthan Jootoo, David Lattanzi",2017/11/1,Journal Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering,"A key phase in the bridge design process is the selection of the structural system. Due to budget and time constraints, engineers typically rely on engineering judgment and prior experience when selecting a structural system, often considering a limited range of design alternatives. The objective of this study was to explore the suitability of supervised machine learning as a preliminary design aid that provides guidance to engineers with regards to the statistically optimal bridge type to choose, ultimately improving the likelihood of optimized design, design standardization, and reduced maintenance costs. In order to devise this supervised learning system, data for more than 600,000 bridges from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) database were analyzed.

A prototype imaging and visualization system for robotic infrastructure inspection,"David A Lattanzi, Greg Miller",2013,Book Structures Congress 2013: Bridging Your Passion with Your Profession,"Civil inspection images are notoriously difficult to interpret for those who were not present during an inspection, and so they have historically had limited value in ongoing condition monitoring applications. Within the last decade, the advent of inexpensive digital imaging has compounded this problem by making it possible and common to capture and report numerous images, creating information overload that can easily overwhelm engineers and structure owners. More recently, developments in electronics manufacturing and robotics have made automated structural inspection an emergent technology for civil engineers, which inevitably is leading to even more digital image data that must be handled.

Full-scale highway bridge deformation tracking via photogrammetry and remote sensing,"William Graves, Kiyarash Aminfar, David Lattanzi",2022/6/9,Journal Remote Sensing,"Recent improvements in remote sensing technologies have shown that techniques such as photogrammetry and laser scanning can resolve geometric details at the millimeter scale. This is significant because it has expanded the range of structural health monitoring scenarios where these techniques can be used. In this work, we explore how 3D geometric measurements extracted from photogrammetric point clouds can be used to evaluate the performance of a highway bridge during a static load test. Various point cloud registration and deformation tracking algorithms are explored. Included is an introduction to a novel deformation tracking algorithm that uses the interpolation technique of kriging as the basis for measuring the geometric changes. The challenging nature of 3D point cloud data means that statistical methods must be employed to adequately evaluate the deformation field of the bridge. The results demonstrate a pathway from the collection of digital photographs to a mechanical analysis with results that capture the bridge deformation within one standard deviation of the mean reported value. These results are promising given that the midspan bridge deformation for the load test is only a few millimeters. Ultimately, the approaches evaluated in this work yielded errors on the order of 1 mm or less for ground truth deflections as small as 3.5 mm. Future work for this method will investigate using these results for updating finite element models.",7

Combining convolutional neural networks with unsupervised learning for acoustic monitoring of robotic manufacturing facilities,"Jeffrey Bynum, David Lattanzi",2021/4,Journal Advances in Mechanical Engineering,"For automated robotic manufacturing, a key aspect of monitoring is the identification and segmentation of core actuation processes captured in sensor logs.

Automated 3D Image-Based Section Loss Detection for Finite Element Model Updating,"Kasra Ghahremani, Ali Khaloo, David Lattanzi",2016/6,Conference 33rd International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction (ISARC 2016),"Accurate and rapid condition assessment of inservice infrastructure systems is critical for systemwide prioritization decisions. One major assessment consideration is structural section loss due to deterioration, for instance from corrosion. Modern 3D imaging, which generates high-resolution 3D point clouds, is capable of measuring this degradation. Despite growth in the fields of point cloud analysis, few studies have addressed the potential of using such data for creating and updating numerical finite element models of structures. This paper presents a framework for automatic and systematic 3D section loss detection in structural components, followed by a corresponding update to a finite element model. Point cloud data of a targeted structure is obtained by using recently developed Dense Structure from Motion (DSfM) algorithms. Section loss damage is then located and identified by using computer vision techniques.

Fusion and visualization of bridge deck nondestructive evaluation data via machine learning,"Sara Mohamadi, David Lattanzi, Hoda Azari",2020/11/16,Journal Frontiers in Materials,"To maintain infrastructure safety and integrity, nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies are often used for detection of subsurface defects and for holistic condition assessment of structures. While the rapid advances in data collection and the diversity of available sensing technologies provide new opportunities, the ability to efficiently process data and combine heterogeneous data sources to make robust decisions remains a challenge. Heterogeneous NDE measurements often conflict with one another and methods to visualize integrated results are usually developed ad hoc. In this work, a framework is presented to support fusion of multiple NDE techniques in order to improve both detection and quantification accuracy while also improving the visualization of NDE results. For data sources with waveform representations, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to extract salient features and facilitate fusion with scalar-valued NDE measurements. The description of a signal in terms of its salient features using a wavelet transform allows for capturing the significance of the original data, while suppressing measurement noise. The complete set of measurements is then fused using nonparametric machine learning so as to relax the need for Bayesian assumptions regarding statistical distributions. A novel visualization schema based on classifier confidence intervals is then employed to support holistic visualization and decision making.

A machine learning based approach to bridge design prototyping,"Achyuthan Jootoo, David Lattanzi",1846,Journal Proc. in International Conference on Computing in Civil and Building Engineering (ICCCBE),"Billions of dollars are spent each year on the construction of bridges. While the financial impact of sub-optimal bridge designs is difficult to determine, given the hundreds of thousands of bridges in the United States alone, it is clearly significant. The bridge design process can be broken into three stages¬¬–(1) preliminary design to choose the bridge prototype for detailed design,(2) detailed final design, and (3) design optimization. This paper focuses on the first stage of the design process–choosing the bridge structure prototype. In the preliminary design stage, an engineer first chooses a preliminary design predominantly via his/her experience in tandem with preliminary calculations. To simulate this experience-based design process, machine learning is used to predict multiple bridge prototypes via models developed from the National Bridge Inventory data of over 600,000 bridges and seismic data from United States Geological Survey (USGS). The results of this machine learning study indicated several key design parameters that controlled most design choices, and demonstrated that such models are capable of sufficient accuracy for use in the design process. Significant variation in model performance was observed among individual states, likely due to differences in design preferences, material availability, and site-specific considerations. The next phase of this work will explore how to combine these machine learning models with advanced optimization methods in an effort to provide robust design support systems to engineers.",4
Life-Cycle Modeling of Structural Defects via Computational Geometry and Time-Series Forecasting,"Sara Mohamadi, David Lattanzi",2019/10/21,Journal Sensors,"The evaluation of geometric defects is necessary in order to maintain the integrity of structures over time. These assessments are designed to detect damages of structures and ideally help inspectors to estimate the remaining life of structures. Current methodologies for monitoring structural systems, while providing useful information about the current state of a structure, are limited in the monitoring of defects over time and in linking them to predictive simulation. This paper presents a new approach to the predictive modeling of geometric defects. A combination of segments from point clouds are parametrized using the convex hull algorithm to extract features from detected defects, and a stochastic dynamic model is then adapted to these features to model the evolution of the hull over time. Describing a defect in terms of its parameterized hull enables consistent temporal tracking for predictive purposes, while implicitly reducing data dimensionality and complexity as well. In this study, two-dimensional (2D) point clouds analogous to information derived from point clouds were firstly generated over simulated life cycles. The evolutions of point cloud hull parameterizations were modeled as stochastic dynamical processes via autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and vectorized autoregression (VAR) and compared against ground truth. The results indicate that this convex hull approach provides consistent and accurate representations of defect evolution across a range of defect topologies and is reasonably robust to noisy measurements; however, assumptions regarding the underlying dynamical process play a significant the role in …",3
Extraction of Structural System Designs from Topologies via Morphological Analysis and Artificial Intelligence,"Achyuthan Jootoo, David Lattanzi",2018/2/13,Journal Designs,"Structural system design is the process of giving form to a set of interconnected components subjected to loads and design constraints while navigating a complex design space. While safe designs are relatively easy to develop, optimal designs are not. Modern computational optimization approaches employ population based metaheuristic algorithms to overcome challenges with the system design optimization landscape. However, the choice of the initial population, or ground structure, can have an outsized impact on the resulting optimization. This paper presents a new method of generating such ground structures, using a combination of topology optimization (TO) and a novel system extraction algorithm. Since TO generates monolithic structures, rather than systems, its use for structural system design and optimization has been limited. In this paper, truss systems are extracted from topologies through morphological analysis and artificial intelligence techniques. This algorithm, and its assessment, constitutes the key contribution of this paper. The structural systems obtained are compared with ground truth solutions to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. The generated structures are also compared against benchmark designs from the literature. The results indicate that the presented truss generation algorithm produces structures comparable to those generated through metaheuristic optimization, while mitigating the need for assumptions about initial ground structures.",3

And as robotic manufacturing expands, the need for autonomous process monitoring has consequently expanded as well. In an industrial scenario, damage is typically incurred through machine wear from power transmission sources (eg bearing, gear, motor, belt, rail/track, and material wear), and performance degradations may occur nearly instantaneously, or slowly over time. The consequences of such damage can be localized to a single mechanical system, or it can cascade into catastrophic damage across a facility. In this work, a nondestructive method for identify and tracking processes and events within a manufacturing facility is presented, based on analysis of an autonomous acoustic monitoring system …",2
Robust outlier detection and normal estimation in noisy infrastructure 3d point clouds,"Ali Khaloo, David Lattanzi",2017,Book Computing in Civil Engineering 2017,"Modern remote sensing technologies such as three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning or photogrammetry are in increasing demand for civil engineering applications such as infrastructure maintenance and as-built construction verification. In order to leverage the resulting point clouds, reliable estimation of the normal vector for each point in a cloud is a fundamental task for applications such as point-based rendering, 3D surface reconstruction, feature detection, or object segmentation. However, 3D point clouds generated by the aforementioned techniques are prone to noise, outliers, missing/erroneous data and sampling anisotropy, all of which impede reliable normal vector estimation. To address these issues, the method presented herein utilizes robust multivariate statistical outlier analysis for normal estimation in complex 3D point clouds with varying noise levels and geometric complexities.

Integrating 3D computer vision and robotic infrastructure inspection,"A Khaloo, DAVID Lattanzi",2017,Journal Structural health monitoring,"Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in the field of robotic inspection systems, in particular Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). These systems afford many advantages in terms of reducing the cost of condition assessments and expediting the data acquisition while improving the monitoring process efficiency. However, robotic technologies are a means of collecting data, and data collection protocols must be tightly linked with the desired spatial data resolution and final products, particularly if integration with more conventional structural health monitoring technologies is to be attained. This process involves planning a set of views, physically altering the relative structureimaging sensor pose, globally registering all the acquired imagery data, and finally integrating different sources of data into a nonredundant model. In this context, this paper demonstrates the capabilities of using one such integration at the Brighton Dam, a complex and large-scale gravity dam in Maryland, USA. The goal of this study was to evaluate a robotic inspection methodology along with utilizing computer vision-based data analytics on photogrammetrically generated three-dimensional (3D) models of the dam. A series of experiments involving the analysis of both simulated and real structural damage were designed and performed. During these experiments, digital image data was collected from a variety of sources, including both fixed-wing and multi-rotor UAVs, as well as more conventional imaging platforms. These data sources were integrated and merged together to form a detailed high-resolution 3D model of the dam and surrounding environs, with …",2
Stability of large reinforcing column cages during temporary construction conditions,"Girum S Urgessa, David Lattanzi, Michael J Casey",2016/2/1,Journal Practice Periodical on Structural Design and Construction,"Reinforcing cages for large columns requires shoring during the fabrication and erection stages of construction before concrete is placed to form a permanent load-bearing structure. Many column-reinforcing cage collapses have occurred, resulting in injuries and fatalities because the cages were not properly supported in the temporary condition. Guying systems are commonly used to stabilize large reinforcing cages during construction to avoid such accidents. This paper presents a two-dimensional first-principle stability analysis of reinforcing cages that are either pinned or fixed at the base, and supported by one level of guy wires along the height of the cage. The effect of lowering guy-wire attachment points on the stability of cages is also included because this construction practice is reported to be used in some locales.

A computational framework for next-generation inspection imaging,David Lattanzi,2013/7/25,"Description Civil inspection images are notoriously difficult to interpret for those who were not present during an inspection, and so they have historically had limited value in ongoing condition monitoring applications. Within the last decade the advent of inexpensive digital imaging has compounded this problem by making it possible and common to capture and report numerous images, creating information overload that can easily overwhelm engineers and structure owners. More recently, developments in electronics manufacturing and robotics have made automated structural inspection an emergent technology for civil engineers, which inevitably is leading to even more digital image data that must be handled. This dissertation presents a systematic approach to capturing, processing, and representing inspection image data such that the inherent value of these increasingly large data sets can be realized. Using a data pipeline combining automated image capture, contextualized 3D visualization, and robust computational imaging and regression techniques, the goal is to allow engineers to view inspection images in their 3D spatial context, while aiding them through enhanced damage detection routines, all while helping to minimize field inspection disruptions through the use of robotic imaging.

Defining baseline model for bridge analysis and design,"Erin Santini Bell, Brian Brenner, Masoud Sanayei, David Lattanzi",2006,Source Transportation Research Board 85th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"In current AASHTO design practices, bridges are designed on an elemental basis. AASHTO code specifies that each structural element is to be designed for the loads it will experience during the life of the bridge. The calculated loads are enveloped to produce maximum loads. This approach, elemental design, is structurally sound, in general conservative, and has resulted in the design and construction of safe and reliable bridges. Designers use a matrix approach to evaluate a set of what are essentially initial-state load conditions. This paper describes development of a"" baseline"" bridge model and suggests certain modifications to the traditional bridge design process to take advantage of modern computing capabilities to create a refined baseline model. The baseline model is an analytical model which accounts for the full system behavior of the structure, as opposed to the elemental approach which envelopes loads and conditions to evaluate separate components of the bridge structure. The baseline model is a three-dimensional structural model employing finite element software. A sample baseline model is developed and evaluated for a simple span steel composite concrete stringer bridge. Advantages and challenges for application of the baseline model, as part of a modified overall bridge design process, are presented and discussed.",2

Of particular consideration here is load testing of bridges to evaluate the existing load-carrying capacity. Sensor systems are often mounted directly to girders for this assessment; however, installing sensors and data acquisition systems can be an expensive and time-consuming process, particularly given that load testing does not warrant long-term monitoring. As an alternative, noncontact remote sensing techniques have been developed for measuring structural deformations, and have the potential to be used for static load test applications. These approaches do not require sophisticated instrumentation installations, and can provide a denser array of measurements, compared with conventional sensors. A particular focus has been on techniques that use video recordings, tracking the motion between subsequent video …",1
Traffic Flow Forecasting with Maintenance Downtime via Multi-Channel Attention-Based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks,"Yuanjie Lu, Parastoo Kamranfar, David Lattanzi, Amarda Shehu",2021/10/4,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.01535,"Forecasting traffic flows is a central task in intelligent transportation system management. Graph structures have shown promise as a modeling framework, with recent advances in spatio-temporal modeling via graph convolution neural networks, improving the performance or extending the prediction horizon on traffic flows. However, a key shortcoming of state-of-the-art methods is their inability to take into account information of various modalities, for instance the impact of maintenance downtime on traffic flows. This is the issue we address in this paper. Specifically, we propose a novel model to predict traffic speed under the impact of construction work. The model is based on the powerful attention-based spatio-temporal graph convolution architecture but utilizes various channels to integrate different sources of information, explicitly builds spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states, captures the relationships between heterogeneous roadway networks, and then predicts changes in traffic flow resulting from maintenance downtime events. The model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets and a novel dataset we have collected over the bustling Tyson's corner region in Northern Virginia. Extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies show that the proposed model can capture complex and nonlinear spatio-temporal relationships across a transportation corridor, outperforming baseline models.",1
A Computational Geometry Approach to the Life-Cycle Modeling of Remotely-Sensed Defects,"Sara Mohamadi, David Lattanzi",2019/6/13,"Book Computing in Civil Engineering 2019: Smart Cities, Sustainability, and Resilience","Remote sensing is gaining in popularity for structural condition assessment, and in current practice, engineers are collecting large amounts of data throughout a system’s life-cycle. These data must be interpreted to characterize defects, and to help engineers estimate a structure’s remaining life. The challenge is that remotely-sensed defects are not typically quantified in a manner that robustly conveys life-cycle dynamics. We propose that the geometric concept of the convex hull can help address this limitation. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that surrounds all points in a set, regardless of dimensionality, and is a unique representation of the set. Describing a defect in terms of its parameterized hull enables consistent temporal tracking for predictive purposes, while implicitly reducing data dimensionality and complexity as well. Furthermore, the concept of the convex hull can be extended to high …",1
Hybridizing Topology Optimization and Evolutionary Computation to Support Computer-Aided Engineering Design,"Achyuthan Jootoo, David Lattanzi",2017,Book Computing in Civil Engineering 2017,"Every structural design incorporates biases from the professional experiences of engineers involved in the design process, resulting in choices that do not necessarily lead to optimal designs. And, while the design codes provide a methodology for safe design, optimal design is not explicitly considered. In response, artificial intelligence and advanced computation techniques are emerging avenues for guiding engineers towards optimal designs. This research explores this concept through a hybridization of topology optimization (TO) and evolutionary algorithms (EA) for design optimization. TO and EA have both been studied for use in structural optimization, however each of these techniques is inadequate individually. Since TO generates monolithic components, the designs need to be heavily post-processed to generate practical structural assemblies. The challenge of using EA is that the performance of the …",1
Repurposing video recordings for structure motion estimations,"Ali Khaloo, David Lattanzi",2016/4/21,"Conference Nondestructive Characterization and Monitoring of Advanced Materials, Aerospace, and Civil Infrastructure 2016","Video monitoring of public spaces is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, particularly near essential structures and facilities. During any hazard event that dynamically excites a structure, such as an earthquake or hurricane, proximal video cameras may inadvertently capture the motion time-history of the structure during the event. If this dynamic time-history could be extracted from the repurposed video recording it would become a valuable forensic analysis tool for engineers performing post-disaster structural evaluations. The difficulty is that almost all potential video cameras are not installed to monitor structure motions, leading to camera perspective distortions and other associated challenges. This paper presents a method for extracting structure motions from videos using a combination of computer vision techniques.

NDE Data Correlation Using Encoder–Decoder Networks with Wavelet Scalogram Images,"Mozhgan Momtaz Dargahi, David Lattanzi, Hoda Azari",2022/12,Journal Journal of Nondestructive Evaluation,"Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies are increasingly used to provide information about the subsurface integrity of structural components. While NDE can provide powerful insights, efficiently and consistently correlating information from different NDE sources poses significant challenges. Heterogenous NDE data capture different representations of subsurface phenomenon. This can lead to challenges when trying to associate information from multiple NDE sources across a structure’s life cycle. Conceptually, one way to address this is to characterize NDE data in terms of the fundamental (latent) information that is shared between NDE data types, though this remains an understudied problem. An improved understanding of the correlation among the heterogenous NDE data would enable new pathways for the engineers to integrate and analyze NDE data, and potentially lead to a new form of structural …",
Multiple Instance Learning for Detecting Anomalies over Sequential Real-World Datasets,"Parastoo Kamranfar, David Lattanzi, Amarda Shehu, Daniel Barbará",2022/10/4,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.01707,"Detecting anomalies over real-world datasets remains a challenging task. Data annotation is an intensive human labor problem, particularly in sequential datasets, where the start and end time of anomalies are not known. As a result, data collected from sequential real-world processes can be largely unlabeled or contain inaccurate labels. These characteristics challenge the application of anomaly detection techniques based on supervised learning. In contrast, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been shown effective on problems with incomplete knowledge of labels in the training dataset, mainly due to the notion of bags. While largely under-leveraged for anomaly detection, MIL provides an appealing formulation for anomaly detection over real-world datasets, and it is the primary contribution of this paper. In this paper, we propose an MIL-based formulation and various algorithmic instantiations of this framework based on different design decisions for key components of the framework. We evaluate the resulting algorithms over four datasets that capture different physical processes along different modalities. The experimental evaluation draws out several observations. The MIL-based formulation performs no worse than single instance learning on easy to moderate datasets and outperforms single-instance learning on more challenging datasets. Altogether, the results show that the framework generalizes well over diverse datasets resulting from different real-world application domains.",

The work takes a multi-asset approach with emphasis on pavements and bridges. It accounts for system-wide traffic impacts of postponed treatments, downtime impacts of construction work zones on traffic performance, and post-action benefits in terms of capacity and speed. It further incorporates uncertainty in system state due to stochasticity in the evolution of deterioration and its underlying physical processes. The technologies enable a deeper understanding of the nature of sensed data and its utility specific to the perception of roadway condition and the ability to detect deteriorated conditions and ascertain relationships between sensed condition and serviceability levels across assets. Performance indices, deterioration rates, and collected data are often significantly different between asset classes. Consequently, maintenance planning tools and managing practices often focus on only one distinct asset class, without integrating other asset types into their analysis, resulting in different asset classes competing for limited funds and suboptimal performance of the larger roadway network. Compatible serviceability assessments of individual asset types, as well as overall system serviceability, are directly supported. This effort provides important tools needed to enhance decision making. Opportunities to integrate these tools into existing software are identified.
