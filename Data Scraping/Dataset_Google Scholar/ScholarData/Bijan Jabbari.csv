Analysis of measurement based prioritization schemes for handovers in cellular networks,"Sirin Tekinay, Bijan Jabbari",1992/12/6,Conference [Conference Record] GLOBECOM'92-Communications for Global Users: IEEE,"A performance analysis of the first-in first-out (FIFO) and the priority queueing schemes, in comparison to the simple call handling scheme where there is no queuing, is presented. All analytical results are verified by simulation studies of the three schemes. With queuing of handovers, if all channels are occupied, new calls are blocked and handover requests are queued so that as soon as a channel is available, it is offered a handover request in the queue; new calls are blocked until the queue of handovers is emptied. In the priority queueing scheme, the mobile subscriber with the highest instantaneous priority is served first. The results indicate that the priority queueing scheme provides lower probability of forced termination and call blocking than FIFO queuing.< >",17

A decomposable random walk model for mobility in wireless communications,"Bijan Jabbari, Yong Zhou, Frederick S Hillier",2001/3,Journal Telecommunication Systems,"In this paper we develop models to represent the time until boundary crossing and associated statistics in cellular wireless networks. We propose modeling the terminal movements within a cell by a discrete two-dimensional random walk process. We note that in such an environment mobile units tend to move in roughly a straight line, with occasional backtracking, for a significant period of time before changing direction. We determine the time until crossing an exit point from a circular cell by choosing a random direction from the starting point to an exit point. The user would actually be moving in fluctuating directions until reaching this exit point. Subsequently, we calculate the expected time to reach the exit point as a function of the constant speed of travel and the propensity to change direction en route. The model is rather general and has the potential to be used for highly irregular cell shapes when …",6

Cognitive radios, benefiting from their advanced features including adaptability and spectrum sensing, can coexist and share the spectrum with licensed radios, under the constraint that their interference remains below a manageable level. In this chapter, using tools from theory of point processes, statistical models are obtained for interference and power control strategies are proposed for interference avoidance. In addition, a cooperative framework is proposed where cognitive radios are assigned the spectrum for a portion of time as remuneration for their assistance in modifying their interference statistics and improving the capacity of primary links.

However, the problem becomes more challenging when the beacons are non-stationary, or when the location of the beacons is not precisely known. In this paper, we analyze the effect of the uncertain beacon positions on the localization error. First we examine the performance of the conventional localization techniques. Subsequently, we study the effectiveness of a novel technique, which utilizes the topological diversity provided by the various combinations of beacon nodes. Results from our modeling effort show that this approach helps reduce the errors caused by imperfect knowledge of beacon positions. The results also indicate that the use of this approach improves the robustness of location estimation as compared to existing methods.",2
The scalability and performance of common vector solution to generalized label continuity constraint in hybrid optical/packet networks,"Shujia Gong, Bijan Jabbari",2007/11/26,Conference IEEE GLOBECOM 2007-IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference,"In hybrid optical/packet networks, wavelength and VLAN tag continuity along a label switched path are two common constraints. These two types of constraints, referred to as generalized label continuity constraints, have global significance in a network; namely, the label should appear only in other link- or node-disjoint paths. In considering these constraints, a solution is the common vector approach, which seeks a common available label along the path determined by CSPF without label constraints. In this paper, we provide an estimation method to compute the upper bound of the blocking probability for the above approach. We also address the scalability problem of the existing traffic engineering algorithms. We then present the simulation results corroborating with our analytical model.",2

We analyze the performance for a homogeneous traffic case and present simulation results for representative ring networks. We demonstrate that the bounds are very tight with an error of less than 2% when the traffic load is modest. The approach is based on partitioning the state space into subspaces and weighting the upper bound of blocking probability in each subspace with the occurrence of the states. The computational complexity of the approach is comparable to solving a degree of N polynomial equation.,2

Block-classified motion compensation scheme for digital video,"SOHAIL Zafar, Ya-Qin Zhang, BIJAN Jabbari",1996/3/1,Issue ANL/MCS/CP-87743; CONF-960269-1,A novel scheme for block-based motion compensation is introduced in which a block is classified according to the energy that is directly related to the motion activity it represents. This classification allows more flexibility in controlling the bit rate arid the signal-to-noise ratio and results in a reduction in motion search complexity. The method introduced is not dependent on the particular type of motion search algorithm implemented and can thus be used with any method assuming that the underlying matching criteria used is minimum absolute difference.

Our work concerns the study and the improvement of this routing in order to optimize network resources usage and to reduce congestion risks, while taking into account the reactivity upon a network failure and the network stability. We have introduced our work by defining an architecture gathering a whole of building blocks which constitue a MPLS-TE (MPLS-Traffic Engineering) routing system. This architecture allows to classify existing solutions MPLS-TE and to discuss the various possible approaches to implement the architecture, and in particular the distribution of the functions (centralized or distributed), the level of coordination in the treatment of the LSP (Label Switched Path) requests (coordinated or not) and the time scale (o ine or online). We have focused on the combination of distributed and non-coordinated modes where the LSP establishment requests are handled directly on the head routers, independently the ones of the others. This combination offers a better reactivity upon a network failure or an abrupt change of the traffic matrix. On the other hand, it offers worse performances in terms of network resources usage optimization, and blocking risks (non satisfied requests). This requires to find a tradeoff between the optimization performances and the reactivity of the routing system. In order to improve the optimization performances and to reduce the blocking risks of this combination while preserving the good reactivity, we propose two approaches.

Block-classified bidirectional motion compensation scheme for wavelet-decomposed digital video,"Sohail Zafar, YQ Zhang, B Jabbari",1997/8/1,Issue ANL/MCS/PP-87730,"In this paper the authors introduce a block-classified bidirectional motion compensation scheme for the previously developed wavelet-based video codec, where multiresolution motion estimation is performed in the wavelet domain. The frame classification structure described in this paper is similar to that used in the MPEG standard. Specifically, the I-frames are intraframe coded, the P-frames are interpolated from a previous I- or a P-frame, and the B-frames are bidirectional interpolated frames. They apply this frame classification structure to the wavelet domain with variable block sizes and multiresolution representation. They use a symmetric bidirectional scheme for the B-frames and classify the motion blocks as intraframe, compensated either from the preceding or the following frame, or bidirectional (i.e., compensated based on which type yields the minimum energy). They also introduce the concept of F-frames, which are analogous to P-frames but are predicted from the following frame only. This improves the overall quality of the reconstruction in a group of pictures (GOP) but at the expense of extra buffering. They also study the effect of quantization of the I-frames on the reconstruction of a GOP, and they provide intuitive explanation for the results. In addition, the authors study a variety of wavelet filter-banks to be used in a multiresolution motion-compensated hierarchical video codec.",
Traffic characterization and modeling of wavelet-based VBR encoded video,"Yu Kuo, B Jabbari, S Zafar",1997/7/1,Issue ANL/MCS/PP-88417,"Wavelet-based video codecs provide a hierarchical structure for the encoded data, which can cater to a wide variety of applications such as multimedia systems. The characteristics of such an encoder and its output, however, have not been well examined. In this paper, the authors investigate the output characteristics of a wavelet-based video codec and develop a composite model to capture the traffic behavior of its output video data. Wavelet decomposition transforms the input video in a hierarchical structure with a number of subimages at different resolutions and scales. the top-level wavelet in this structure contains most of the signal energy. They first describe the characteristics of traffic generated by each subimage and the effect of dropping various subimages at the encoder on the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. They then develop an N-state Markov model to describe the traffic behavior of the top wavelet. The behavior of the remaining wavelets are then obtained through estimation, based on the correlations between these subimages at the same level of resolution and those wavelets located at an immediate higher level. In this paper, a three-state Markov model is developed. The resulting traffic behavior described by various statistical properties, such as moments and correlations, etc., is then utilized to validate their model.",

Tra c Characterization and Modeling of Wavelet-based VBR Encoded Video,"Yu Kuoy, Sohail Zafarz, Bijan Jabbarix","Wavelet-based video codecs provide a hierarchical structure for the encoded data, which can cater to a wide variety of applications such as multimedia systems. The characteristics of such an encoder and its output, however, have not been well examined. In this paper, we investigate the output characteristics of a wavelet-based video codec and develop a composite model to capture the tra c behavior of its output video data. Wavelet decomposition transforms the input video in a hierarchical structure with a number of subimages at di erent resolutions and scales. The top-level wavelet in this structure contains most of the signal energy. We rst describe the characteristics of tra c generated by each subimage and the effect of dropping various subimages at the encoder on the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver.We then develop an N-state Markov model to describe the tra c behavior of the top wavelet. The behavior of the remaining wavelets are then obtained through estimation, based on the correlations between these subimages at the same level of resolution and those wavelets located at an immediate higher level. In our paper, a three-state Markov model is developed. The resulting tra c behavior described by various statistical properties, such as moments and correlations, etc., are then utilized to validify our model.","Scholar articles Tra c Characterization and Modeling of Wavelet-based VBR Encoded VideoY Kuoy, S Zafarz, B JabbarixRelated articles All 5 versions ","Wavelet-based video codecs provide a hierarchical structure for the encoded data, which can cater to a wide variety of applications such as multimedia systems.

Wavelet-Decomposed Digital Video,Bijan Jabbari,"Several recent results have indicated that subbaIid/wavelet-based approaches have outperfornied DC’T-based techniques for still images. Examples such as vector sub-band coder (VSC’)[9], ernbedded zero-tree wavelets (EZW)[131. and trellis-coded wavelet compression [16] have shown superior performance to the JPEG baseline coding standard. However, when applied to full-motion video sequence. waveletbased techniques have not shown clear advantages compared with DCT-based techniques such as MPEG 2 [ll]. The reason is that block-based motion searching and compensation match well to the block-based DCT structure, while for wavelet-based coding, block-based motion structure is in fundamental conflict with the globalbased wavelet decomposition. In addition, it is difficult to employ the adaptive structure of intra/inter-compensation decision present at the macro-block level for wavelet because of its global decomposition.Several attempts have been made to solve this problem. In r24. 251: and [23] we introduced a video codec based on multiresolution motion compensation (MRMC) for a hierarchically decomposed video using wavelet decomposition, where motion estimation is performed in the wavelet domain rather than in the original image domain. The four MRMC schemes we proposed can be used for any hierarchical representation and are not particularly limited to wavelet decomposition. Since our multiresolution motion estimation scheme utilizes the correlation of motion at different levels of the hierarchy. it gives better results in terms of overall complexity and performance than do traditional approaches.

Coverage/Outage Analysis of an Integrated Wi-Fi Meshed LTE Femtocell Network,"Anthony Busson, Lynda Zitoune, Véronique Vèque, Bijan Jabbari","The femtocell-Wi-Fi integration is a promising approach to solve the problem of inter-tier or intra-tier interference in heterogeneous networks. In this paper, multimode femtocell base stations are deployed which form a Wi-Fi mesh network to communicate between themselves while deploying cellular technology (eg, LTE) for communications with mobile users, thus ensuring ultimately connectivity between mobile users and their macro base stations to improve the network coverage. We propose a tractable model for coverage/outage to evaluate the benefits of such integration in terms of SINR and received signal strength. Our work is based on point processes in twodimensional plane that models locations of femtocell-Wi-Fi (also referred to as multimode) nodes. The proposed model is more realistic than the classical Poisson point process, as the distribution of points is more homogeneous and it ensures that the nodes are not too close to each other. The derivation of coverage/outage formula allows us to determine operational parameter ranges for the Wi-Fi network to form a mesh network. In addition, it helps in the design of the femtocell network to ensure a suitable coverage for users in terms of SINR and received signal strength.","Scholar articles Coverage/Outage Analysis of an Integrated Wi-Fi Meshed LTE Femtocell NetworkA Busson, L Zitoune, V Vèque, B JabbariRelated articles ","The femtocell-Wi-Fi integration is a promising approach to solve the problem of inter-tier or intra-tier interference in heterogeneous networks.

Lightpath setup route selection scheme using multi-path message in an optical grid network using GMPLS,"Daisuke Ishii, Bijan Jabbari, Naoaki Yamanaka","Grid computing environments for large-scale scientific computation have been developed in wide-area networks. WDM optical networks are expected to be the main carriers for the grid computing. Also, to control complicated network systems, the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)[1] suite of protocols allows carriers to automate the provisioning and management of the network, and promises to lower the cost of operation. So, some optical gird network such as [2] are implemented.In the conventional lambda-grid network using GMPLS, the shortest route is calculated by using the link cost which is exchanged at the routing protocol of GMPLS. Also, the interval of exchanging the costs of the link is much longer than the holding time of the lightpath. So, dynamic network topology change cannot be considered for the routing protocol of GMPLS. Therefore, the traffic load is concentrated on a certain link, and it causes the blocking of lightpath setup. In this research, we propose the lightpath setup route selection scheme in order to improve the blocking probability.","Scholar articles Lightpath setup route selection scheme using multi-path message in an optical grid network using GMPLSD Ishii, B Jabbari, N YamanakaRelated articles All 3 versions ","Grid computing environments for large-scale scientific computation have been developed in wide-area networks.
