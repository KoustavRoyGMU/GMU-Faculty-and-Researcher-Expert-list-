A Digital Body Farm for collecting Deleted File Decay Data,"Omoche Cheche Agada, Ibifubara Iganibo, James Jones, Kevin Fairbanks",2022/7/10,"Book Advances in Digital Forensics XVIII: 18th IFIP WG 11.9 International Conference, Virtual Event, January 3–4, 2022, Revised Selected Papers","Recovering deleted data can be a time-consuming task during digital forensic investigations. As tedious as the task is, it may not produce useful results. New files written to locations containing previously-deleted file data may render some or even all of the deleted file unrecoverable. Insights into the factors that influence deleted file decay are required to enable digital forensic professionals to determine if attempting file recovery is a wise use of time. Significant research efforts have focused on deleted file decay, but gaps in knowledge still exist. This chapter discusses an attempt at collecting data to help discover how deleted file content decays over time in computing systems running the Microsoft New Technology Filesystem (NTFS). In particular, it describes the implementation of a digital body farm that uses differential analysis to monitor and record patterns of decay as deleted data are erased or overwritten on …",1
The Distributed Digital Body Farm: Enabling the Analysis of Deleted File Decay Patterns,"Omoche Cheche Agada, James H Jr Jones, Kevin Fairbanks",2022/8/8,Book Proceedings of the 15th Workshop on Cyber Security Experimentation and Test," Estimating the rate and pattern of deleted file decay on digital media is of interest to digital forensic investigators. Understanding how deleted file contents decay and the factors that affect the process is useful in making decisions about artifact recovery during a forensic investigation. Although the mechanisms that cause deleted file content decay are well known, the actual decay behavior and patterns of decay are not well understood, and one cannot predict with certainty if some or all of a file may be recovered after it has been deleted. This work demonstrates a novel method for collecting data about deleted file content decay from real world systems, without violating user privacy. We present the design of the distributed digital body farm (DDBF) and demonstrate its application in collecting deleted file decay data from geographically dispersed computers. The DDBF is a remote software agent that collects content …",
A Distributed Digital Body Farm for Dynamic Monitoring of File Decay Patterns on the NTFS Filesystem,Omoche Cheche Agada,2022,Institution George Mason University,"Forensic recovery of previously deleted data could be a time-consuming activity during a digital forensic investigation. As tedious as the procedure is, it may not produce useful results or any results at all, as the deleted file data decay process may have rendered such data irrecoverable. Proper insight into the rates, patterns, and factors that influence digital artifact decay is necessary to help investigators determine if attempting a recovery is a wise use of time. A significant amount of research effort has been invested in the study of deleted artifact decay, but knowledge gaps still exist. This work developed, implemented, tested, and applied a tool to collect deleted file decay data, then analyzed that data to determine decay rates and patterns, as well as factors affecting those decay rates and patterns. The work describes a methodology and the implementation of a distributed digital body farm (DDBF)—a suite of …",
