Greenbench: A benchmark for observing power grid vulnerability under data-centric threats,"Mingkui Wei, Wenye Wang",2014/4/27,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2014-IEEE conference on computer communications,"Smart grid is a cyber-physical system which integrates communication networks into traditional power grid. This integration, however, makes the power grid susceptible to cyber attacks. One of the most distinguished challenges in studying the aftermath of cyber attacks in smart grid lies in  data-centric  threats. Even though such attacks are critical to the information network, they will result in much more Domino-like impact than they behave in cyber world. This is because for an information-centric network, distorted or delayed information undermines services and applications. But in power grid, these data-centric attacks may result in instable power systems, and further detrimental impact of power supplies. In this paper, we present Greenbench, a benchmark that is designed to evaluate real-time power grid dynamics in response to data-centric attacks. The simulation results provide several counter-intuitive …",49
Efficient and privacy-aware authentication scheme for EVs pre-paid wireless charging services,"Khaled Rabieh, Mingkui Wei",2017/5/21,Conference 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),"One of the most promising technologies that will be used for charging Electric Vehicles (EVs) is wireless charging. By employing this technology, an EV is able to charge its battery without the need to stop. The charging stations should authenticate the EVs before allowing them to charge their batteries. Traditional digital signature reveals the real identity of the driver and degrades the location privacy. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving authentication scheme for EVs wireless charging scenario. Our objective is not only to enable the EVs and the charging station to perform mutual authentication but to protect the privacy of the drivers without the need of a Third Trusted Party (TTP). The EVs use blind signature for authentication with the charging station to protect their privacy. Then, they use hash chains to authenticate themselves to the charging pads which are limited constraint devices. The …",17
Toward distributed intelligent: A case study of peer to peer communication in smart grid,"Mingkui Wei, Wenye Wang",2013/12/9,Conference 2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),"Smart grid is an emerging cyber-physical system which aims at making power systems more intelligent and efficient. One of the major attributes of smart grid is integration of distributed renewable power resources into the traditional power grid. As a result, traditional centralized control is not always effective in smart grid, and distributed control is essential for flexible energy management. To facilitate distributed control, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), which are embedded computers equipped on power devices, are interconnected based on the peer-to-peer communication model. An open question is whether such a distributed control mechanism over peer to peer communication is delay-efficient to support time-critical smart grid applications. To answer this question, we establish a micro smart grid, called Green Hub, to measure the delay performance for both distributed and centralized control systems. Our …",17
Collaborative deep learning for medical image analysis with differential privacy,"Danni Yuan, Xiaoyan Zhu, Mingkui Wei, Jianfeng Ma",2019/12/9,Conference 2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),"Deep learning algorithms, especially convolution neural networks, have attracted huge attention in the field of medical image analysis. A hospital could train a neural network to detect disease based on medical images possessing. However, the number of medical images would affect the results of training. If medical images of all hospitals are collected together, there's a risk of privacy leakage. In this paper, we apply collaborative deep learning to medical image analysis, which could help to improve the training effect. Besides, we also exploit differential privacy, the analytic Gaussian Mechanism, to prevent the leakage of information about medical images. We experiment on the Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset. Results show that the analytic Gaussian Mechanism can protect the privacy of medical images effectively, while the influence on the results of training is small. The accuracy can be improved about …",12
Data-centric threats and their impacts to real-time communications in smart grid,"Mingkui Wei, Wenye Wang",2016/7/20,Journal Computer Networks,"One of the most distinguished challenges in studying the aftermath of cyber attacks in smart grid lies in data-centric threats, which refer to cyber attacks aimed at gaining advantage or sabotage the infrastructure by manipulating the data exchanged in the underlying communication network. Even though such attacks are critical by itself in the information network, they will result in more serious impacts to the power grid. This is because for an information-centric network, distorted or delayed information undermines services and applications, in the case of a power grid, however, these data-centric attacks may result in unstable systems, which may further detrimentally impact the power supplies. In this paper, we study the impacts of data-centric attacks in the real-time communication network of smart gird, and further the consequences caused to the power grid.

"SCADA testbed for vulnerability assessments, penetration testing and incident forensics","Sundar Krishnan, Mingkui Wei",2019/6/10,Conference 2019 7th International Symposium on Digital Forensics and Security (ISDFS),"Industrial control systems are critical assets as they interact with real-life aspects of our daily life. These systems often run 24/7 to control and monitor critical industrial and infrastructure processes. The demand to integrate them with the Internet has opened them up for cyber-attacks. The need for skilled expertise starting at the academic level in defending and investigating these critical assets is ever growing. In this paper, the authors design and deploy a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) lab at Sam Houston State University (SHSU) with a limited budget. The lab is designed to stimulate a near-world industrial setting specifically for Industrial cyber-security research (penetration testing, vulnerability analysis and incident forensics) as an accompaniment to the digital forensics education curriculum at the University.",9
On characterizing information dissemination during city-wide cascading failures in smart grid,"Mingkui Wei, Zhuo Lu, Wenye Wang",2017/11/9,Journal IEEE Systems Journal,"Although the smart gird is expected to eliminate cascading failures with the help of real-time system monitoring and control, it is yet unknown whether its underlying communication network is fast and reliable enough to achieve this goal. In this paper, we take an in-depth study on this issue by addressing three specific questions: 1) what is the evolution process of information dissemination and fault propagation in the smart grid?; 2) how to quantify the impact of cascading failures?; and 3) what are the conditions that information dissemination becomes either a booster or an adversary in mitigating cascading failures? To answer these questions, we build an innovative framework, the cascading failure with communications framework, to consolidate both communication networks and power grids, and provide quantitative evaluation on the impact of cascading failures. By studying and observing the progress of …",8
Claim what you need: a text-mining approach on android permission request authorization,"Mingkui Wei, Xi Gong, Wenye Wang",2015/12/6,Conference 2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),"Android is one of the most popular mobile operating systems nowadays, whose popularity, however, also attracts even more crafty developers to develop malicious softwares, or malwares, to exploit illegitimate means for profit. As a basic countermeasure, Android enforces the permission request scheme, in which an application (App) is required to present to the user the system resources (permissions) it will access, and ask user's approval before installation. However, this approach has been proven ineffective as it delegates the whole responsibility of decision- making to the user, who usually lacks the professional knowledge to comprehend the interpretation of a permission. Alternatively, many current researches focus on identifying potential malwares based on attributes of individual Apps, such as inspecting their source code, which, unfortunately, fall in another extreme which tend to make the decision for the …",7
Safety can be dangerous: secure communications impair smart grid stability under emergencies,"Mingkui Wei, Wenye Wang",2015/12/6,Conference 2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),"Smart grid features real-time monitoring and control by integrating advanced communication networks into traditional power grids. This integration, however, makes smart grid vulnerable to cyber attacks, i.e., the anomalies caused by attackers in the communication network can affect ordinary operations of the power grid and result in severe physical damage. To protect smart grid from cyber attacks, many traditional countermeasures, such as message encryption, have been proposed to be directly migrated to fit this system. In this regard, the very first fundamental questions that need to be addressed are how to evaluate and compare the physical impacts of cyber attacks and countermeasures, and whether traditional cyber security countermeasures can result in satisfactory performance in smart grid. Motivated by these questions, we establish a small-scale smart grid prototype, and use both experiments and cross …",6
Combat the disaster: Communications in smart grid alleviate cascading failures,"Mingkui Wei, Wenye Wang",2014/12/15,Conference 2014 11th Annual High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies (Photonics for Energy),"Cascading failure is one of the most catastrophic events in power grid, which refers to large scale power system outage caused by the rampant spread of small scale system fault or even single device failure. Its disastrous result is expected to be mitigated in the scope of smart gird, in which communication enabled smart devices exchange critical information to preclude such events. To carry the concept into reality, one pivotal step is quantitative study of the benefit smart grid can bring, i.e., to what extent smart grid can improve power system stability, specifically, in combating cascading failure? We identify three aspects, time, space, and scale, which are needed for thorough evaluation of the impact of a cascading failure, and further propose a new cascading failure model which is able to depict all three aspects with numerical results. Our observations explicitly suggest that communication between power devices is …",6
Phishfry-a proactive approach to classify phishing sites using scikit learn,"Daniel Brites, Mingkui Wei",2019/12/9,Conference 2019 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps),"Phishing is a type of malicious attack that involves the fooling of unsuspecting victims into providing or sharing personal information such as names, addresses, and banking information, which may lead to damages to the individual such as identity theft and financial losses. To combat phishing attacks, there have been many strides toward the use of newer technologies instead of conventional approaches such as personnel training and physical security. These technologies involve a proactive approach towards identifying Phishing websites that utilize machine learning and have become more and more efficient. In this paper, a more proactive and online machine learning approach is proposed that utilize features that have been well-accepted among industries and academia. Within the algorithm, prioritizing of features will be broken up into layers, and the output of the tool will be a digital tag that could be included …",5
How they interact? Understanding cyber and physical interactions against fault propagation in smart grid,"Zhuo Lu, Mingkui Wei, Xiang Lu",2017/5/1,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2017-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,"In the smart grid, computer networks (i.e., the cyber domain) are built upon physical infrastructures (i.e., the physical domain) to facilitate advanced functionalities that were considered not possible in legacy systems. It is envisioned that such a cyber-physical paradigm enables intelligent, collaborative controls to prevent faults from propagating along large-scale infrastructures, which is a primary cause for massive blackouts (e.g., Northeast blackout of 2003). Despite this promising vision, how effective cyber and physical interactions are against fault propagation is not yet fully investigated. In this paper, we use analysis and system-level simulations to characterize such interactions during load shedding, which is a process to stop fault propagation by shedding a computed amount of loads based on collaborative communication. Specifically, we model faults happening in the physical domain as a counting process, with …",5
Dominoes with communications: On characterizing the progress of cascading failures in smart grid,"Mingkui Wei, Zhuo Lu, Wenye Wang",2016/5/22,Conference 2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),"Cascading failures are one of the most devastating forces in power systems, which may be initially triggered by minor physical faults, then spread with Domino-like chain-effect, resulting in large-scale blackout. How to prevent cascading failures becomes imperative, as our daily lives heavily depend on stable and reliable power supply. The next-generation power system, namely Smart Grid, is envisioned to facilitate real-time and distributed control of critical power infrastructures, thus effectively forestalling cascading failures. Although cascading failures have been well investigated in the literature, most studies were confined only in the power operation domain with the assumption that communication is always perfect, which is, however, not true for today's communication networks, where traffic congestion and random delay happen. Therefore, an open question is how to characterize cascading failures in the …",5
A proactive and deceptive perspective for role detection and concealment in wireless networks,"Zhuo Lu, Cliff Wang, Mingkui Wei",2016,Journal Cyber Deception: Building the Scientific Foundation,"In many wireless networks (e.g., tactical military networks), the one-to-multiple communication model is pervasive due to commanding and control requirements in mission operations. In these networks, the roles of nodes are non-homogeneous; i.e., they are not equally important. This, however, opens a door for an adversary to target important nodes in the network by identifying their roles. In this chapter, we focus on investigating an important open question: how to detect and conceal the roles of nodes in wireless networks? Answers to this question are of essential importance to understand how to identify critical roles and prevent them from being the primary targets. We demonstrate via analysis and simulations that it is feasible and even accurate to identify critical roles of nodes by looking at network traffic patterns.

Warmonger: inflicting denial-of-service via serverless functions in the cloud,"Junjie Xiong, Mingkui Wei, Zhuo Lu, Yao Liu",2021/11/12,Book Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,"We debut the Warmonger attack, a novel attack vector that can cause denial-of-service between a serverless computing platform and an external content server. The Warmonger attack exploits the fact that a serverless computing platform shares the same set of egress IPs among all serverless functions, which belong to different users, to access an external content server. As a result, a malicious user on this platform can purposefully misbehave and cause these egress IPs to be blocked by the content server, resulting in a platform-wide denial of service. To validate the Warmonger attack, we ran months-long experiments, collected and analyzed the egress IP usage pattern of four major serverless service providers (SSPs). We also conducted an in-depth evaluation of an attacker's possible moves to inflict an external server and cause IP-blockage. We demonstrate that some SSPs use surprisingly small numbers of …",4
Domain Shadowing: Leveraging Content Delivery Networks for Robust Blocking-Resistant Communications.,Mingkui Wei,2021/8/11,Conference USENIX Security Symposium,"We debut domain shadowing, a novel censorship evasion technique leveraging content delivery networks (CDNs). Domain shadowing exploits the fact that CDNs allow their customers to claim arbitrary domains as the back-end. By setting the front-end of a CDN service as an allowed domain and the back-end a blocked one, a censored user can access resources of the blocked domain with all “indicators”, including the connecting URL, the SNI of the TLS connection, and the Host header of the HTTP (S) request, appear to belong to the allowed domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that domain shadowing can be proliferated by domain fronting, a censorship evasion technique popularly used a few years ago, making it even more difficult to block. Compared with existing censorship evasion solutions, domain shadowing is lightweight, incurs negligible overhead, and does not require dedicated third-party support. As a proof of concept, we implemented domain shadowing as a Firefox browser extension and demonstrated its capability in circumventing censorship within a heavily censored country known by its strict censorship policies and advanced technologies.",4
Empirical comparison of DSLRs and smartphone cameras for latent prints photography,"Robert Pitts, Mingkui Wei, Jorn Yu, Alicia Rairden",2021/1,Source Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Forensic Science,"Law enforcement agencies take extreme caution when it comes to the selection of the image acquisition devices for evidence photography. For example, there was a large gap between when the digital camera was invented and when it became popularly used, and when it was adopted by law enforcement agencies to capture images for the documentation of crime scenes and physical evidence. Similarly, although smartphones are commonly used for taking photos and are gradually replacing digital cameras to become the mostly used photography devices, using smartphones for evidence photography is still uncommon among law enforcement agencies. In this article, we discuss a particular use scenario of smartphone photography, that is, using a smartphone to capture images of latent fingerprints.

On studying information dissemination in social-physical interdependent networks,"Mingkui Wei, Jie Wang, Zhuo Lu, Wenye Wang",2019/5/20,Conference ICC 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),"Most existing studies for information dissemination in the online social network are based on variations of the classical epidemic model. In such a model, nodes recursively infect, or share information to, their neighboring nodes with a certain probability. The higher degree a node has, the more likely it gets infected by its neighbors. Although widely accepted, we found there are certain discrepancies between existing epidemic models and social interactions in reality. Firstly, the real-world social network is actually a dual-layered network, where a person shares information online to her online friends, and also offline to her real-life friends. More importantly, since a computer do not automatically share information, a computer exposed to information will not effectively receive it (i.e., getting infected and starting to infect others) unless its user receives it. Secondly, contrary to the epidemic model, the more friends a person …",2
How Can Cyber-Physical Interdependence Affect the Mitigation of Cascading Power Failure?,"Mingkui Wei, Zhuo Lu, Yufei Tang, Xiang Lu",2018/4/16,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2018-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,"Utilizing advanced communication technologies to facilitate power system monitoring and control, the smart grid is envisioned to be more robust and resilient against cascading failures. Although the integration of communication network does benefit the smart grid in many aspects, such benefits should not overshadow the fact that the interdependence between the communication network and the power infrastructure makes the smart grid more fragile to cascading failures. Thus, it is essential to understand the impact of such cyber-physical integration with interdependence from both positive and negative perspectives. In this paper, we develop a systematic framework to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of the cyber-physical interdependence. We use theoretical analysis and system-level simulations to characterize the impact of such interdependence. We identify two phases during the progress of failure …",2
Content delivery network assisted user geolocation,Mingkui Wei,2022/6/16,Patent office US,"Described herein is a novel approach for coarse-grained user geolocation leveraging widely-deployed content delivery networks (CDNs).

On modeling and understanding vehicle evacuation attacks in vanets,"Mingkui Wei, Zhuo Lu, Wenye Wang",2017/5/21,Conference 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),"To secure a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), extensive studies have been conducted on developing authentication infrastructures, and identifying misbehaving vehicles. The effectiveness of such efforts heavily depends on the underlying communication network. However, information exchange in the VANET can be severely delayed because of its highly-dynamic and partially-connected topology. Such delay can be potentially exploited by attackers to cause physical impacts to the transportation system. In this paper, we propose and model a new attack, called vehicle evacuation attack, to investigate how the message delay endangers the trustworthiness in VANETs, and further causes physical impacts to cars on the road. Our study demonstrates that there exists a linear relationship between the delay of message dissemination and the impact of the vehicle evacuation attack, which can be used as a guideline …",1
When Third-Party JavaScript Meets Cache: Explosively Amplifying Security Risks on the Internet,"Tao Hou, Shengping Bi, Mingkui Wei, Tao Wang, Zhuo Lu, Yao Liu",2022/10/3,Conference 2022 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),"Today's web applications feature the proliferation of third-party JavaScript inclusion, which incurs a range of security risks. Although attack strategies by manipulating third-party JavaScript files have been widely investigated, the adverse impact caused by third-party JavaScript inclusion and caching does not receive much attention.

"Modeling, Evaluation and Enhancement of Threats-Induced Reliability in Cyber-Physical Systems.",Mingkui Wei,2016/6/6,"Description WEI, MINGKUI. Modeling, Evaluation and Enhancement of Threats-Induced Reliability in Cyber-Physical Systems.(Under the direction of Wenye Wang.)The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) has become to be a popular topic in the recent decades. The CPS integrates the cyber-system, ie, advanced communication networks, and the conventional physical system, such as power grids and transportation systems, such that real-time monitoring and control can be implemented. And as a result, the efficiency and effectiveness of conventional physical-system can be greatly enhanced. However, the integrating of the communication network, unfortunately, also makes the CPS especially susceptible to cyber-attacks. Already one of the biggest concern in the cyber-world, cyber-attacks in CPS gains the opportunity to directly and remotely attack physical devices, which may eventually interrupt and detriment the normal operation of physical systems. To this end, it is imperative to understand the physical impact that can be caused by cyber-attacks in the Cyber-Physical System. The focus of this thesis has been placed on modeling, evaluating and enhancing such physical impacts on two of the most critical cyber-physical systems, which are, the Smart Grid, and the Intelligent Transportation System.","WEI, MINGKUI.
