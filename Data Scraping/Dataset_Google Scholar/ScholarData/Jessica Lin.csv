"A symbolic representation of time series, with implications for streaming algorithms","Jessica Lin, Eamonn Keogh, Stefano Lonardi, Bill Chiu",2003/6/13,Book Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGMOD workshop on Research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,"The parallel explosions of interest in streaming data, and data mining of time series have had surprisingly little intersection. This is in spite of the fact that time series data are typically streaming data. The main reason for this apparent paradox is the fact that the vast majority of work on streaming data explicitly assumes that the data is discrete, whereas the vast majority of time series data is real valued.Many researchers have also considered transforming real valued time series into symbolic representations, nothing that such representations would potentially allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities, in addition to allowing formerly ""batch-only"" problems to be tackled by the streaming community. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from three fatal flaws …",2586

While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from two fatal flaws. First, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Second, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series …",1857
Hot sax: Efficiently finding the most unusual time series subsequence,"Eamonn Keogh, Jessica Lin, Ada Fu",2005/11/27,Conference Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05),"In this work, we introduce the new problem of finding time series discords. Time series discords are subsequences of a longer time series that are maximally different to all the rest of the time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusual subsequence within a time series. Time series discords have many uses for data mining, including improving the quality of clustering, data cleaning, summarization, and anomaly detection. Discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments.

Clustering of time-series subsequences is meaningless: implications for previous and future research,"Eamonn Keogh, Jessica Lin",2005/8,Journal Knowledge and information systems,"Given the recent explosion of interest in streaming data and online algorithms, clustering of time-series subsequences, extracted via a sliding window, has received much attention. In this work, we make a surprising claim. Clustering of time-series subsequences is meaningless. More concretely, clusters extracted from these time series are forced to obey a certain constraint that is pathologically unlikely to be satisfied by any dataset, and because of this, the clusters extracted by any clustering algorithm are essentially random. While this constraint can be intuitively demonstrated with a simple illustration and is simple to prove, it has never appeared in the literature. We can justify calling our claim surprising because it invalidates the contribution of dozens of previously published papers. We will justify our claim with a theorem, illustrative examples, and a comprehensive set of experiments on reimplementations …",812
Rotation-invariant similarity in time series using bag-of-patterns representation,"Jessica Lin, Rohan Khade, Yuan Li",2012/10,Journal Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,"For more than a decade, time series similarity search has been given a great deal of attention by data mining researchers.

While some of the existing approaches work well for short time series data, they typically fail to produce satisfactory results when the sequence is long. For long sequences, it is more appropriate to consider the similarity based on the higher-level structures. In this work, we present a histogram-based representation for time series data, similar to the “bag of words” approach that is widely accepted by the text mining and information retrieval communities.

Mining motifs in massive time series databases,"Pranav Patel, Eamonn Keogh, Jessica Lin, Stefano Lonardi",2002/12/9,"Conference 2002 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, 2002.

However, from a knowledge discovery viewpoint, a more interesting problem is the enumeration of previously unknown, frequently occurring patterns. We call such patterns ""motifs"", because of their close analogy to their discrete counterparts in computation biology. An efficient motif discovery algorithm for time series would be useful as a tool for summarizing and visualizing massive time series databases. In addition it could be used as a subroutine in various other data mining tasks, including the discovery of association rules, clustering and classification.

The algorithm works by leveraging off the multi-resolution property of wavelets. The dilemma of choosing the initial centers is mitigated by initializing the centers at each approximation level, using the final centers returned by the coarser representations. In addition to casting the clustering algorithms as anytime algorithms, this approach has two other very desirable properties. By working at lower dimensionalities we can efficiently avoid local minima. Therefore, the quality of the clustering is usually better than the batch algorithm. In addition, even if the algorithm is run to completion, our approach is much faster than its batch counterpart. We explain, and empirically demonstrate these surprising and desirable properties with comprehensive experiments on several publicly available real data sets …",273

Tapnet: Multivariate time series classification with attentional prototypical network,"Xuchao Zhang, Yifeng Gao, Jessica Lin, Chang-Tien Lu",2020/4/3,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"With the advance of sensor technologies, the Multivariate Time Series classification (MTSC) problem, perhaps one of the most essential problems in the time series data mining domain, has continuously received a significant amount of attention in recent decades. Traditional time series classification approaches based on Bag-of-Patterns or Time Series Shapelet have difficulty dealing with the huge amounts of feature candidates generated in high-dimensional multivariate data but have promising performance even when the training set is small. In contrast, deep learning based methods can learn low-dimensional features efficiently but suffer from a shortage of labelled data. In this paper, we propose a novel MTSC model with an attentional prototype network to take the strengths of both traditional and deep learning based approaches. Specifically, we design a random group permutation method combined with multi-layer convolutional networks to learn the low-dimensional features from multivariate time series data. To handle the issue of limited training labels, we propose a novel attentional prototype network to train the feature representation based on their distance to class prototypes with inadequate data labels. In addition, we extend our model into its semi-supervised setting by utilizing the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on 18 datasets in a public UEA Multivariate time series archive with eight state-of-the-art baseline methods exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model.",133

Dimensionality reduction by random projection and latent semantic indexing,"Jessica Lin, Dimitrios Gunopulos",2003/5/1,"Journal proceedings of the Text Mining Workshop, at the 3rd SIAM International Conference on Data Mining","Document categorization and classification is of seminal importance for information retrieval. During the past decade the growth of Internet has fundamentally changed the ways that information is shared, and it has made clear that efficient methods for searching and exploring vast amounts of data should be put forward. The largest challenges associated with information retrieval are synonymy and high dimensionality. An elegant and accurate technique to solve both problems has been presented in the form of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSI). However, its high computational cost makes it infeasible for large databases. Therefore other models such as random projection have been proposed. A suggestion for combining these two approaches has also been proposed. However, best to our knowledge, no empirical results have been presented on this “hybrid” method. In this paper we evaluate and compare these three approaches and discover that the seemingly promising combination of LSI and random projection does not always result in faster running time as expected.",108

We demonstrate that grammar induction in time series can effectively identify repeated patterns without prior knowledge of their lengths.

Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression.,"Pavel Senin, Jessica Lin, Xing Wang, Tim Oates, Sunil Gandhi, Arnold P Boedihardjo, Crystal Chen, Susan Frankenstein",2015/3/23,Conference Edbt,"The problem of anomaly detection in time series has recently received much attention. However, many existing techniques require the user to provide the length of a potential anomaly, which is often unreasonable for real-world problems. In addition, they are also often built upon computing costly distance functions–a procedure that may account for up to 99% of an algorithm’s computation time. Addressing these limitations, we propose two algorithms that use grammar induction to aid anomaly detection without any prior knowledge. Our algorithm discretizes continuous time series values into symbolic form, infers a contextfree grammar, and exploits its hierarchical structure to effectively and efficiently discover algorithmic irregularities that we relate to anomalies. The approach taken is based on the general principle of Kolmogorov complexity where the randomness in a sequence is a function of its algorithmic incompressibility. Since a grammar induction process naturally compresses the input sequence by learning regularities and encoding them compactly with grammar rules, the algorithm’s inability to compress a subsequence indicates its Kolmogorov (algorithmic) randomness and correspondence to an anomaly.",96
Clustering of streaming time series is meaningless,"Jessica Lin, Eamonn Keogh, Wagner Truppel",2003/6/13,Book Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGMOD workshop on Research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,"Time series data is perhaps the most frequently encountered type of data examined by the data mining community.

We define representative patterns of a class as a set of subsequences that has the greatest discriminative power to distinguish one class of time series from another. Our approach rests upon two techniques with linear complexity: symbolic discretization of time series, which generalizes the structural patterns, and grammatical inference, which automatically finds recurrent correlated patterns of variable length, producing an initial pool of common patterns shared by many instances in a class. From this pool of candidate patterns, our algorithm selects the most representative patterns that capture the class specificities, and that can be used to effectively discriminate between time series classes.

In this work we motivate and investigate the problem of reverse nearest neighbor search on high dimensional, multimedia data. We propose exact and approximate algorithms that do not require pre-computation of nearest neighbor distances, and can potentially prune off most of the search space. We demonstrate the utility of reverse nearest neighbor search by showing how it can help improve the classification accuracy.",26
Linear time complexity time series classification with bag-of-pattern-features,"Xiaosheng Li, Jessica Lin",2017/11/18,Conference 2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),"Time series classification has attracted much attention due to the ubiquity of time series. With the advance of technologies, the volume of available time series data becomes huge and the content is changing rapidly. This requires time series data mining methods to have low computational complexities. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free time series classification method that has a linear time complexity. The approach is evaluated on all the 85 datasets in the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results show that the new method achieves better overall classification accuracy performance than the widely used benchmark, i.e. 1-nearest neighbor with dynamic time warping, while consuming orders of magnitude less running time. The proposed method is also applied on a large real-world bird sounds dataset to verify its effectiveness.",24

Alarm fatigue can cause longer response time or missing of important alarms. In this work, we propose a methodology to identify false alarms generated by ICU bedside monitors. The novelty in our approach lies in the extraction of 216 relevant features to capture the characteristics of all alarms, from both arterial blood pressure (ABP) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Our multivariate approach mitigates the imprecision caused by existing heartbeat/peak detection algorithms. Unlike existing methods on ICU false alarm detection, our approach does not require separate techniques for different types of alarms. The experimental results show that our approach can achieve high accuracy on false alarm detection, and can be generalized for different types of alarms.",24
HIME: discovering variable-length motifs in large-scale time series,"Yifeng Gao, Jessica Lin",2019/10/1,Journal Knowledge and Information Systems,"Detecting repeated variable-length patterns, also called variable-length motifs, has received a great amount of attention in recent years.

Extracting statistical graph features for accurate and efficient time series classification,"Daoyuan Li, Jessica Lin, Tegawendé François D Assise Bissyande, Jacques Klein, Yves Le Traon",2018,Journal 21st International Conference on Extending Database Technology,"[en] This paper presents a multiscale visibility graph representation for time series as well as feature extraction methods for time series classification (TSC). Unlike traditional TSC approaches that seek to find global similarities in time series databases (eg., Nearest Neighbor with Dynamic Time Warping distance) or methods specializing in locating local patterns/subsequences (eg., shapelets), we extract solely statistical features from graphs that are generated from time series. Specifically, we augment time series by means of their multiscale approximations, which are further transformed into a set of visibility graphs. After extracting probability distributions of small motifs, density, assortativity, etc., these features are used for building highly accurate classification models using generic classifiers (eg., Support Vector Machine and eXtreme Gradient Boosting). Thanks to the way how we transform time series into graphs and extract features from them, we are able to capture both global and local features from time series. Based on extensive experiments on a large number of open datasets and comparison with five state-of-the-art TSC algorithms, our approach is shown to be both accurate and efficient: it is more accurate than Learning Shapelets and at the same time faster than Fast Shapelets.",19
An agent-based system with temporal data mining for monitoring financial stability on insurance markets,"Iqbal Owadally, Feng Zhou, Rasaq Otunba, Jessica Lin, Douglas Wright",2019/6/1,Journal Expert Systems with Applications,"We describe an expert system to monitor the stability of insurance markets.

Efficient discovery of unusual patterns in time series,"Stefano Lonardi, Jessica Lin, Eamonn Keogh, Bill ‘Yuan-chi’ Chiu",2006/11,Journal New Generation Computing,"The problem of finding a specified pattern in a time series database (i.e., query by content) has received much attention and is now a relatively mature field. In contrast, the important problem of enumerating all surprising or interesting patterns has received far less attention. This problem requires a meaningful definition of “surprise”, and an efficient search technique. All previous attempts at finding surprising patterns in time series use a very limited notion of surprise, and/or do not scale to massive datasets. To overcome these limitations we propose a novel technique that defines a pattern surprising if the frequency of its occurrence differs substantially from that expected by chance, given some previously seen data.

Ensemble grammar induction for detecting anomalies in time series,"Yifeng Gao, Jessica Lin, Constantin Brif",2020/1/29,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.11102,"Time series anomaly detection is an important task, with applications in a broad variety of domains. Many approaches have been proposed in recent years, but often they require that the length of the anomalies be known in advance and provided as an input parameter. This limits the practicality of the algorithms, as such information is often unknown in advance, or anomalies with different lengths might co-exist in the data. To address this limitation, previously, a linear time anomaly detection algorithm based on grammar induction has been proposed. While the algorithm can find variable-length patterns, it still requires preselecting values for at least two parameters at the discretization step. How to choose these parameter values properly is still an open problem. In this paper, we introduce a grammar-induction-based anomaly detection method utilizing ensemble learning. Instead of using a particular choice of parameter values for anomaly detection, the method generates the final result based on a set of results obtained using different parameter values. We demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach can outperform existing grammar-induction-based approaches with different criteria for selection of parameter values. We also show that the proposed approach can achieve performance similar to that of the state-of-the-art distance-based anomaly detection algorithm.",7

Semantic Discord: Finding unusual local patterns for time series,"Li Zhang, Yifeng Gao, Jessica Lin",2020,Book Proceedings of the 2020 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining,"Finding anomalous subsequence in a long time series is a very important but difficult problem. Existing state-of-the-art methods have been focusing on searching for the subsequence that is the most dissimilar to the rest of the subsequences; however, they do not take into account the background patterns that contain the anomalous candidates. As a result, such approaches are likely to miss local anomalies. We introduce a new definition named semantic discord, which incorporates the context information from larger subsequences containing the anomaly candidates. We propose an efficient algorithm with a derived lower bound that is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the brute force algorithm in real world data. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in locating anomalies by extensive experiments. We further explain the interpretability of semantic discord.",4

A uniform representation for trajectory learning tasks,"Qingzhe Li, Jessica Lin, Liang Zhao, Huzefa Rangwala",2017/11/7,Book Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,"Most trajectory data are collected with a constant sample rate (e.g. GPS data). However, the variance of velocities can be very large, which causes the non-uniformity of the sample points in trajectory dataset. That is, the trajectory dataset can be very sparse in some parts which cause most existing distance measures to get unexpected results. On the other hand, the dataset can be extremely dense in some other parts which results in unnecessarily high computational complexity. Due to the above phenomenon, choosing an appropriate sample rate becomes a difficult challenge. In order to address the dilemma, we propose a Step-Invariant Trajectory (SIT) representation that can provide a dynamic sample rate to represent any trajectories in a uniform way.

A new Arabic stemming algorithm,"Eiman Tamah AlShammari, Jessica Lin",2008/8/25,Journal Proc. 2nd ITRW on Experimental Linguistics,"Text processing is a vital step in the information retrieval process, text mining, and natural language processing. It includes several stages, such as normalization, stop word removal, and stemming. Stemming is the process of reducing the lexicon to its root. Due to the different structures and rules in languages, the task of stemming is language-dependent. This research introduces a new stemming algorithm for the Arabic Language. Arabic is one of the most complex languages, both spoken and written. However, it is also one of the most common languages in the world. It is the base from which many other languages are derived. Despite the wide usage of the language, technology and development for Arabic has been limited. The main reason lies within the formulation rules of Arabic, as Arabic language exhibits a very complicated morphological structure. Existing Arabic stemmers suffer from high stemming error-rates. They blindly stem all the words and perform poorly, especially with compound words, proper nouns and foreign Arabized words. The main cause of this problem is the stemmer’s lack of knowledge of the word lexical category (ie noun, verb, proposition, etc.) This paper presents a new stemming algorithm that relies on Arabic language morphology and Arabic language syntax. The automated addition to the syntactic knowledge reduced both stemming error and stemming cost. Additionally, the new Algorithm automatically creates it is own list of proper nouns, and compound words based on the processed corpus.",3

Joint time series chain: Detecting unusual evolving trend across time series,"Li Zhang, Nital Patel, Xiuqi Li, Jessica Lin",2022,Book Proceedings of the 2022 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM),"Time series chain (TSC) is a recently introduced concept that captures the evolving patterns in large scale time series.

Time series chain has the great potential to reveal latent unusual evolving trend in the time series, or identify precursor of important events in a complex system. Unfortunately, existing definitions of time series chains only consider finding chains in a single time series.

LB-SimTSC: An Efficient Similarity-Aware Graph Neural Network for Semi-Supervised Time Series Classification,"Wenjie Xi, Arnav Jain, Li Zhang, Jessica Lin",2023/1/12,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.04838,"Time series classification is an important data mining task that has received a lot of interest in the past two decades. Due to the label scarcity in practice, semi-supervised time series classification with only a few labeled samples has become popular. Recently, Similarity-aware Time Series Classification (SimTSC) is proposed to address this problem by using a graph neural network classification model on the graph generated from pairwise Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of batch data. It shows excellent accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in several few-label settings. However, since SimTSC relies on pairwise DTW distances, the quadratic complexity of DTW limits its usability to only reasonably sized datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a new efficient semi-supervised time series classification technique, LB-SimTSC, with a new graph construction module. Instead of using DTW, we propose to utilize a lower bound of DTW, LB_Keogh, to approximate the dissimilarity between instances in linear time, while retaining the relative proximity relationships one would have obtained via computing DTW. We construct the pairwise distance matrix using LB_Keogh and build a graph for the graph neural network. We apply this approach to the ten largest datasets from the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results demonstrate that this approach can be up to 104x faster than SimTSC when constructing the graph on large datasets without significantly decreasing classification accuracy.",
PMP: Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile against Sensitive Pattern Inference for Time Series,"Li Zhang, Jiahao Ding, Yifeng Gao, Jessica Lin",2023/1/4,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.01838,"Recent rapid development of sensor technology has allowed massive fine-grained time series (TS) data to be collected and set the foundation for the development of data-driven services and applications. During the process, data sharing is often involved to allow the third-party modelers to perform specific time series data mining (TSDM) tasks based on the need of data owner. The high resolution of TS brings new challenges in protecting privacy. While meaningful information in high-resolution TS shifts from concrete point values to local shape-based segments, numerous research have found that long shape-based patterns could contain more sensitive information and may potentially be extracted and misused by a malicious third party.

Robust Time Series Chain Discovery with Incremental Nearest Neighbors,"Li Zhang, Yan Zhu, Yifeng Gao, Jessica Lin",2022/11/3,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.02146,"Time series motif discovery has been a fundamental task to identify meaningful repeated patterns in time series. Recently, time series chains were introduced as an expansion of time series motifs to identify the continuous evolving patterns in time series data. Informally, a time series chain (TSC) is a temporally ordered set of time series subsequences, in which every subsequence is similar to the one that precedes it, but the last and the first can be arbitrarily dissimilar. TSCs are shown to be able to reveal latent continuous evolving trends in the time series, and identify precursors of unusual events in complex systems. Despite its promising interpretability, unfortunately, we have observed that existing TSC definitions lack the ability to accurately cover the evolving part of a time series: the discovered chains can be easily cut by noise and can include non-evolving patterns, making them impractical in real-world applications. Inspired by a recent work that tracks how the nearest neighbor of a time series subsequence changes over time, we introduce a new TSC definition which is much more robust to noise in the data, in the sense that they can better locate the evolving patterns while excluding the non-evolving ones. We further propose two new quality metrics to rank the discovered chains. With extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed TSC definition is significantly more robust to noise than the state of the art, and the top ranked chains discovered can reveal meaningful regularities in a variety of real world datasets.",

Year One of the project saw three major accomplishments. The first accomplishment was the prioritization and selection of anomaly detection methods to improve and extend the existing Grammar Compression (GC) method. One of the key results has been the development of a new method that combines GC with ensemble learning to perform robust and efficient anomaly detection in time series data. The second accomplishment was the down-selection of technologies and data for the prototype Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) system. We have introduced and described a framework by which adoption tradeoffs of DLT for improved Continuity of Knowledge are being objectively evaluated.

These three approaches are natural complements to one another, as DLT and GC-based anomaly detection can be used on traditional safeguards data sources or other available data, and the MPC component allows for exploration of nontraditional data sources in a manner that will protect sensitive operator information.

For DLT technologies, an experimental comparison of current safeguards practice versus a DLT-backed prototype is described. For GC-based anomaly detection, we present the investigation of new methods with improved performance based on ensemble learning and variable-length motif discovery. With regards to MPC-based data protection, the viability of applying the method for anomaly detection is analyzed.

Chromosomal Instability Promotes cGAS‐Mediated Cytosolic DNA Response in Metastatic Cancer,"Morgan E D'Ausilio, Anushka Agrawal, Mira Karande, Teodora Kolarov, Jemma Kushen, Jessica Lin, Matthew Mandel, Sahdev Patel, Sophie Pollard, Samuel F Bakhoum",2019/4,Journal The FASEB Journal,"Recent implication of chromosomal instability (CIN) in metastatic cancer cells has pointed to the frequency of chromosome missegregation as a key difference between primary and metastatic tumors. Understanding the cellular response therefore aids development of treatments to prevent metastasis. Chromosome missegregation creates micronuclei of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments that are prone to rupture in the cytoplasm. The cGAS‐STING pathway responds to cytosolic dsDNA by activating inflammatory response pathways, a reaction useful to protect against viruses. Dimerization of cGAS, induced by dsDNA binding, catalyzes synthesis of cyclic GAMP (cGAMP) from ATP and GTP. Activation of cGAS results in upregulation of IFN‐β and NF‐κB stimulated immune response pathways. Cytosolic dsDNA associated with CIN has been proposed to induce cGAS‐STING mediated immune mimicry in cancer …",

A Novel Step-Invariant Representation for Trajectory Learning,"Qingzhe Li, Jessica Lin, Liang Zhao, Huzefa Rangwala",2017,"Description Trajectory data are usually recorded as a sequence of sampled data points. For most trajectory data collected from human carried GPS devices (eg, Geolife dataset [32]), the data are collected in a constant sampling rate. Since people travel using di erent transportation modes, the variance of velocities is large, which causes the trajectories to be very sparse in some parts but highly dense in some others. is phenomenon seriously challenges the existing trajectory distance measurements in the following two aspects. First, for sparse parts of the trajectory, although several trajectory distance measures have been developed, it is extremely challenging for the existing trajectory measures to work well when the data points are sparse (eg, GPS data collected on highway) due to the absence of matched points pairs among the trajectories. Second, for highly dense parts in the trajectory, the distance measurement is not scalable to large dataset even using the simplest Euclidean distance measure.In order to address the above challenges concurrently, we propose a Step-Invariant Trajectory (SIT) representation with linear time translation from raw data to uniformly distributed trajectory points by dynamically changing the sampling rates. Based on SIT representation, we propose two e ective and scalable distance measures which are BMED and PBMED for SIT. We evaluate the e ectiveness and e ciency of our representation along with its distance measures by performing multiple trajectory classication and clustering experiments. ese results show that our distance measures on SITs is much more robust than other distance measures and representations on …","Trajectory data are usually recorded as a sequence of sampled data points.

RYcheckpoint Algorithm for MultiYEvent Decision Making over Multivariate Time Series,"Alexander Brodsky chunYKit Ngan, Jessica Lin",2012,"Description We propose a Relaxed checkpoint algorithm (RYcheckpoint) to solve MultiYEvent Expert Query Parametric Estimation (MEYEQPE) problems over multivariate time series. Our proposed algorithm combines the strengths of both domainYknowledgeYbased and formalYlearningYbased approaches to learn decision parameters for yielding a reasonable time utility over multivariate time series. More specifically, our approach solves the decision optimization problems to yield the time utility from multiple decision time points, as well as learns the multiple sets of decision parameters in their respective events during the computations at a lower cost. We show that our approach produces a reasonable forecasting result by using the learned multiple sets of decision parameters.","We propose a Relaxed checkpoint algorithm (RYcheckpoint) to solve MultiYEvent Expert Query Parametric Estimation (MEYEQPE) problems over multivariate time series.

One representation that the data mining community has not considered in detail is the discretization of the original data into symbolic strings. At first glance this seems a surprising oversight. There is an enormous wealth of existing algorithms and data structures that allow the efficient manipulations of strings. Such algorithms have received decades of attention in the text retrieval community, and more recent attention from the bioinformatics community. Some simple examples of tools that are not defined for real-valued sequences but are defined for symbolic approaches include hashing, Markov models, suffix trees, decision trees etc. There is, however, a simple explanation for the data mining communitys lack of interest in string manipulation as a supporting technique for mining time series.

Multi-author Review-The Hedgehog family of proteins-Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway in vertebrate epithelial appendage morphogenesis: Perspectives in development and evolution,"CM Chuong, N Patel, J Lin, HS Jung, RB Widelitz",2000,Journal CMLS-Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences,"Vertebrate epithelial appendages are elaborate topological transformations of flat epithelia into complex organs that either protrude out of external (integument) and internal (oral cavity, gut) epithelia, or invaginate into the surrounding mesenchyme. Although they have specific structures and diverse functions, most epithelial appendages share similar developmental stages, including induction, morphogenesis, differentiation and cycling. The roles of the SHH pathway are analyzed in exemplary organs including feather, hair, tooth, tongue papilla, lung and foregut. SHH is not essential for induction and differentiation, but is involved heavily in morphogenetic processes including cell proliferation (size regulation), branching morphogenesis, mesenchymal condensation, fate determination (segmentation), polarizing activities and so on. Through differential activation of these processes by SHH in a spatiotemporal …",

DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL APPROCHES TO ANOMALY DETECTION AND SURETY FOR SAFEGUARDS DATA–YEAR TWO AND THREE RESULTS,"Natacha Peter-Stein, David Farley, Constantin Brif, Nicholas Pattengale, Chase Zimmerman, Yifeng Gao, Jessica Lin, Mitchell Negus, Rachel Slaybaugh, Daniel Archer, Michael Willis, James Ghawaly, Andrew Nicholson","The first phase of the Novel Approaches to Anomaly Detection and Surety for Safeguards Data project which considers the applicability for international safeguards of three core data analysis and management methods was presented at the Institute for Nuclear Materials Management (INMM) Annual Meeting in 2020. Year One of the project saw three major accomplishments. The first accomplishment was the prioritization and selection of anomaly detection methods to improve and extend the existing Grammar Compression (GC) method. One of the key results has been the development of a new method that combines GC with ensemble learning to perform robust and efficient anomaly detection in time series data. The second accomplishment was the down-selection of technologies and data for the prototype Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) system. We have introduced and described a framework by which adoption tradeoffs of DLT for improved Continuity of Knowledge are being objectively evaluated. And the third accomplishment was an assessment of the viability of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) via a study of test scenarios to evaluate how easily anomalies in raw data sequences convert through a garbled circuit.

Group SAX: Extending the Notion of Contrast Sets to Multimedia Data,"Jessica Lin, Eamonn Keogh","In this work, we take the traditional notation of contrast sets and extend them to other data types, in particular time series and by extension, images. In the traditional sense, contrast-set mining identifies attributes, values and instances that differ significantly across groups, and helps user understand the differences between groups of data. We reformulate the notion of contrastsets for time series data, and define it to be the key pattern (s) that are maximally different from the other set of data. We propose a fast and exact algorithm to find the contrast sets, and demonstrate its utility in several diverse domains, ranging from manufacturing to anthropology. We show that our algorithm achieves 3 orders of magnitude speedup from the brute-force algorithm, while producing exact solutions.","Scholar articles Group SAX: Extending the Notion of Contrast Sets to Multimedia DataJ Lin, E KeoghRelated articles All 3 versions ","In this work, we take the traditional notation of contrast sets and extend them to other data types, in particular time series and by extension, images.

It is therefore, imperative that efficient and effective data mining techniques are developed and implemented to extract useful knowledge from these large heterogeneous and multi-modal datasets.

Finding the Most Unusual Time Series,"Eamonn Keogh, Jessica Lin, Sang-Hee Lee, Helga Van Herle","In this work we introduce the new problem of finding time series discords. Time series discords are subsequences of longer time series that are maximally different to all the rest of the time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusual subsequence within a time series. While discords have many uses for data mining, they are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. While the brute force algorithm to discover time series discords is quadratic in the length of the time series, we show a simple algorithm that is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude faster than brute force, while guaranteed to produce identical results.
