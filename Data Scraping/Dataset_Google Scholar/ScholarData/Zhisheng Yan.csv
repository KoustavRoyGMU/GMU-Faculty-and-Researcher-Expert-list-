Your attention is unique: Detecting 360-degree video saliency in head-mounted display for head movement prediction,"Anh Nguyen, Zhisheng Yan, Klara Nahrstedt",2018/10/15,Book Proceedings of the 26th ACM international conference on Multimedia,"Head movement prediction is the key enabler for the emerging 360-degree videos since it can enhance both streaming and rendering efficiency. To achieve accurate head movement prediction, it becomes imperative to understand user's visual attention on 360-degree videos under head-mounted display (HMD). Despite the rich history of saliency detection research, we observe that traditional models are designed for regular images/videos fixed at a single viewport and would introduce problems such as central bias and multi-object confusion when applied to the multi-viewport 360-degree videos switched by user interaction. To fill in this gap, this paper shifts the traditional single-viewport saliency models that have been extensively studied for decades to a fresh panoramic saliency detection specifically tailored for 360-degree videos, and thus maximally enhances the head movement prediction performance.

Medium access control for wireless body area networks with QoS provisioning and energy efficient design,"Bin Liu, Zhisheng Yan, Chang Wen Chen",2016/3/31,Journal IEEE transactions on mobile computing,"With the promising applications in e-Health and entertainment services, wireless body area network (WBAN) has attracted significant interest. One critical challenge for WBAN is to track and maintain the quality of service (QoS), e.g., delivery probability and latency, under the dynamic environment dictated by human mobility. Another important issue is to ensure the energy efficiency within such a resource-constrained network. In this paper, a new medium access control (MAC) protocol is proposed to tackle these two important challenges. We adopt a TDMA-based protocol and dynamically adjust the transmission order and transmission duration of the nodes based on channel status and application context of WBAN. The slot allocation is optimized by minimizing energy consumption of the nodes, subject to the delivery probability and throughput constraints. Moreover, we design a new synchronization scheme to …",133
MAC protocol in wireless body area networks for E-health: Challenges and a context-aware design,"Bin Liu, Zhisheng Yan, Chang Wen Chen",2013/8,Journal IEEE Wireless Communications,"Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) is a promising low power technology that enables the communications between body area sensor nodes and a central coordinator. It targets at many applications in e-Health services. In WBAN, different data sources generate time-varying traffic. Large traffic volume may result in intolerant latency and thus it is extremely important that the most significant data can always be delivered in a real-time fashion. Besides, data transmission may suffer from deep fading and packets loss due to the dynamic on-body channel induced by movements and surrounding environment. Hence, energy-efficient medium access control (MAC) is crucially needed to allocate transmission bandwidth and to ensure reliable transmission considering WBAN contexts, i.e., time-varying human and environment conditions. To improve both efficiency and reliability, we investigate the challenges in the …",111
CA-MAC: A hybrid context-aware MAC protocol for wireless body area networks,"Bin Liu, Zhisheng Yan, Chang Wen Chen",2011/6/13,"Conference 2011 IEEE 13th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services","In wireless body area network (WBAN), various data sources are generated by different type of sensors and transmitted to the master node, which may result in temporally different traffic loads. With time-varying channel caused by frequent body movement, transmitted data may also experience deep fading and packet loss. To meet the complex transmission requirements in WBAN, a traffic-aware and channel-aware MAC protocol is required. In this paper, we introduce CA-MAC, a context-aware MAC protocol using a hybrid of contention-based and TDMA-based approaches. A dynamic control mechanism is proposed to address fading channel by adaptively modifying MAC frame structure. Schedule-based and polling-based techniques are also used to manage periodic, bursty, and emergency traffic requirement. Simulation results confirm the advantage of CA-MAC on reliability over existing TDMA-based approach.",60
A context aware MAC protocol for medical wireless body area network,"Zhisheng Yan, Bin Liu",2011/7/4,Conference 2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference,"During long-term medical monitoring in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN), network requirements (i.e. traffic loads and latency) of various data sources may be different at different time. High traffic loads may lead to data overload and unacceptable latency, which makes potential danger of patients undiagnosed. It is important that real-time transmission of life-critical data can be always guaranteed. To address this problem, a context-aware MAC protocol is presented in this paper. According to analysis of collected life parameters, the protocol can switch between normal state and emergency state. As a result, data rate and duty cycle of sensor nodes are dynamically changed to meet the requirement of latency and traffic loads in a contexta-ware way. To save the power consumption, a TDMA-based MAC frame structure is used. Moreover, a novel optional synchronization scheme is proposed to decrease the …",50
Prius: Hybrid edge cloud and client adaptation for HTTP adaptive streaming in cellular networks,"Zhisheng Yan, Jingteng Xue, Chang Wen Chen",2016/3/8,Journal IEEE transactions on circuits and systems for video technology,"In this paper, we present Prius, a hybrid edge cloud and client adaptation framework for HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) by taking advantage of the new capabilities empowered by recent advances in edge cloud computing. In particular, emerging edge clouds are capable of accessing an application layer and radio access networks (RANs) information in real time. Coupled with powerful computation support, an edge cloud-assisted strategy is expected to significantly enrich mobile services. Meanwhile, although HAS has established itself as the dominant technology for video streaming, one key challenge for adapting HAS to mobile cellular networks is in overcoming the inaccurate bandwidth estimation and unfair bitrate adaptation under the highly dynamic cellular links. Edge cloud-assisted HAS presents a new opportunity to resolve these issues and achieve systematic enhancement of quality of experience (QoE …",40

To fill in this gap, this paper presents a fundamentally new design by jointly considering the end-to-end pipeline from the initial video encoding to the final mobile display. In essence, we shift the classic R-D tradeoff that has governed streaming system designs for decades to a fresh rate-distortion-energy (R-D-E) tradeoff specifically tailored for mobile devices.

Larm: A lifetime aware regression model for predicting youtube video popularity,"Changsha Ma, Zhisheng Yan, Chang Wen Chen",2017/11/6,Book Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,"Online content popularity prediction provides substantial value to a broad range of applications in the end-to-end social media systems, from network resource allocation to targeted advertising. While using historical popularity can predict the near-term popularity with a reasonable accuracy, the bursty nature of online content popularity evolution makes it difficult to capture the correlation between historical data and future data in the long term. Although various existing efforts have been made toward long-term prediction, they need to accumulate a long enough historical data before the prediction and their model assumptions cannot be applied to the complex YouTube networks with inherent unpredictability.",33
Prediction-based dynamic relay transmission scheme for wireless body area networks,"Hui Feng, Bin Liu, Zhisheng Yan, Chi Zhang, Chang Wen Chen",2013/9/8,"Conference 2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","To support long-term pervasive healthcare services, communications in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) need to be both reliable and energy-efficient. As a cooperative transmission method, relay transmission scheme works effectively in resisting shadowing effect and improving reliability in WBANs. However, the extra energy consumption introduced by relay transmission is very high, which can shorten the lifetime of the whole network. In this paper, temporal and spatial correlation models for on-body channels are first presented to better characterize the slow fading effect of on-body channels. Then a prediction-based dynamic relay transmission (PDRT) scheme that makes full use of the correlation characteristics of on-body channels is proposed.

QoS-driven scheduling approach using optimal slot allocation for wireless body area networks,"Zhisheng Yan, Bin Liu, Chang Wen Chen",2012/10/10,"Conference 2012 IEEE 14th international conference on e-health networking, applications and services (Healthcom)","Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a promising type of networks that mainly targets at applications in ubiquitous communication and e-Health services.

Another significant challenge for WBAN is that energy efficiency needs to be guaranteed in such a resource-limited network. In this paper, a QoS-driven scheduling approach is proposed to address these challenges. We model the WBAN channel as a Markov model as suggested by the emerging IEEE 802.15.6 BAN standard and propose a threshold-based scheme to adjust the transmission order of nodes.

QoE continuum driven HTTP adaptive streaming over multi-client wireless networks,"Zhisheng Yan, Jingteng Xue, Chang Wen Chen",2014/7/14,Conference 2014 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME),"Different from traditional HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) in which only one client is considered, HAS over multi-client wireless networks faces new challenges. The Quality of Experience (QoE) of users becomes unstable due to users' competition for shared bandwidth. It is thus important to accurately estimate the perceived experience of users and then adapt the streaming process accordingly. Furthermore, the QoE fairness among multiple clients subscribing to the same services shall also be addressed. In this research, we propose a QoE continuum driven HAS adaptation algorithm to address these challenges. We model the QoE continuum as an integrated consideration of cumulative playback quality and playback smoothness. Based on this model, we jointly optimize the quality adaptation of multiple users by considering both QoE history and channel status. Moreover, we propose to use quantization parameter …",28
Scalable access control for privacy-aware media sharing,"Changsha Ma, Zhisheng Yan, Chang Wen Chen",2018/6/28,Journal IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,"The prevalence of social networks has made it easier than ever for users to share their photos, videos, and other media content with anybody from anywhere. However, the easy access of user-generated media content also brings about privacy concerns. Traditional access control mechanisms, where a single access policy is made for a specific piece of content, cannot satisfy the user privacy requirements in large-scale media sharing systems. Instead, configuring multiple levels of access privileges for the shared media content is desired. On one hand, it conforms to the principle of social networks in information propagation. On the other hand, it accords with the diverse and complex social relationship among social network users. In this paper, we propose a scalable media access control (SMAC) system to enable such a configuration in a secure and efficient manner. The proposed SMAC system is empowered by …",26

As a result, clinics need to ensure that the medicine intake is performed on time. Existing approaches, such as self-report, family reminder, and pill counts, heavily rely on the patients themselves to log the medicine intake (hereafter, patient involvement). Unfortunately, PD patients usually suffer from impaired cognition or memory loss, which leads to the so-called medication non-adherence, including missed doses, extra doses, and mistimed doses. These instances can nullify the treatment or even harm the patients.

A saliency dataset for 360-degree videos,"Anh Nguyen, Zhisheng Yan",2019/6/18,Book Proceedings of the 10th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference,"Despite the increasing popularity, realizing 360-degree videos in everyday applications is still challenging. Considering the unique viewing behavior in head-mounted display (HMD), understanding the saliency of 360-degree videos becomes the key to various 360-degree video research. Unfortunately, existing saliency datasets are either irrelevant to 360-degree videos or too small to support saliency modeling. In this paper, we introduce a large saliency dataset for 360-degree videos with 50,654 saliency maps from 24 diverse videos. The dataset is created by a new methodology supported by psychology studies in HMD viewing. We describe an open-source software implementing this methodology that can generate saliency maps from any head tracking data.

OcuLock: Exploring human visual system for authentication in virtual reality head-mounted display,"Shiqing Luo, Anh Nguyen, Chen Song, Feng Lin, Wenyao Xu, Zhisheng Yan",2020/1,Journal 2020 Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS),"The increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) in a wide spectrum of applications has generated sensitive personal data such as medical records and credit card information. While protecting such data from unauthorized access is critical, directly applying traditional authentication methods (eg, PIN) through new VR input modalities such as remote controllers and head navigation would cause security issues. The authentication action can be purposefully observed by attackers to infer the authentication input. Unlike any other mobile devices, VR presents immersive experience via a head-mounted display (HMD) that fully covers users’ eye area without public exposure. Leveraging this feature, we explore human visual system (HVS) as a novel biometric authentication tailored for VR platforms. While previous works used eye globe movement (gaze) to authenticate smartphones or PCs, they suffer from a high error rate and low stability since eye gaze is highly dependent on cognitive states. In this paper, we explore the HVS as a whole to consider not just the eye globe movement but also the eyelid, extraocular muscles, cells, and surrounding nerves in the HVS. Exploring HVS biostructure and unique HVS features triggered by immersive VR content can enhance authentication stability. To this end, we present OcuLock, an HVS-based system for reliable and unobservable VR HMD authentication. OcuLock is empowered by an electrooculography (EOG) based HVS sensing framework and a record-comparison driven authentication scheme. Experiments through 70 subjects show that OcuLock is resistant against common types of attacks such as …",21

While providing viewers with enriched experience, 360° live video streaming is challenging to achieve since it requires a significantly higher bandwidth and a powerful computation infrastructure. A deeper understanding of this emerging system would benefit both viewers and system designers. Although prior works have extensively studied regular video streaming and 360° video on demand streaming, we for the first time investigate the performance of 360° live video streaming. We conduct a systematic measurement of YouTube's 360° live video streaming using various metrics in multiple practical settings. Our key findings suggest that viewers are advised not to live stream 4K 360° video, even when dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) is enabled. Instead, 1080p 360° live video can be played smoothly. However, the extremely large one-way …",18
Exploring QoE for power efficiency: A field study on mobile videos with LCD displays,"Zhisheng Yan, Qian Liu, Tong Zhang, Chang Wen Chen",2015/10/13,Book Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia,"Display power consumption has become a major concern for both mobile users and design engineers, especially considering the prevalence of today's video-rich mobile services. The power consumption of liquid crystal display (LCD), a dominant mobile display technology, can be reduced by dynamic backlight scaling (DBS). However, such dynamic changes of screen brightness may degrade users' quality of experience (QoE) in viewing videos. How would QoE be impacted by different DBS strategies has not yet been understood clearly and thus obscures the way to achieve systematic power saving. In this paper, we take a first step to explore the QoE of DBS on smartphones and aim at maximally enhancing the display power performance without negatively impacting users' QoE. In particular, we conduct three motivational studies to uncover the inherent relationship between QoE and backlight scaling frequency …",16
SSPA-LBS: Scalable and social-friendly privacy-aware location-based services,"Changsha Ma, Zhisheng Yan, Chang Wen Chen",2019/1/10,Journal IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,"Privacy-aware location-based service (PA-LBS) preserves LBS users' privacy but undesirably sacrifices service quality. In order to balance the two factors with satisfactory user experience, existing frameworks are faced with two barriers, that is, scalability and social-friendliness. First, existing schemes do not enable LBS users to flexibly scale their privacy level on service provision. Such a lack of scalability easily results in either unacceptable service-quality degradation or insufficient privacy protection and fails to meet dynamic user requirements. Second, existing schemes handle privacy protection by merely considering the trust relationship between users and servers but ignore the complex trust relationships among users. As a result, users cannot preserve privacy in location-based social services that involve user-to-user interactions. In this paper, we present the first scalable and social-friendly PA-LBS system.

Exploring Eye Adaptation in Head-Mounted Display for Energy Efficient Smartphone Virtual Reality,"Zhisheng Yan, Chen Song, Feng Lin, Wenyao Xu",2018/2/12,Conference Proceedings of the 19th International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems & Applications,"Smartphone virtual reality (VR) can offer immersive experience while being affordable and easy to use.

Too many pixels to perceive: Subpixel shutoff for display energy reduction on OLED smartphones,"Zhisheng Yan, Chang Wen Chen",2017/10/19,Book Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia,"Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) has been widely recognized as the next-generation mobile display. Recently, smartphone manufacturers have been pushing up the pixel density of OLED display. Unfortunately, such an effort does not necessarily improve the everyday viewing because of the limitation in human visual acuity. Instead, high pixel density OLED can drain the battery power even more quickly since the power dissipation of OLED is determined by the number of displayed pixels and their RGB values, or subpixels. This paper presents a new design dimension to remedy this prevailing issue by leveraging the intuition that shutting off redundant subpixels of the display content on OLED can reduce power consumption without impacting viewing perception. We introduce ShutPix, a power-saving display system for OLED smartphones that can optimally shut off the redundant subpixels before the content is …",14
Event-driven stitching for tile-based live 360 video streaming,"Bo Chen, Zhisheng Yan, Haiming Jin, Klara Nahrstedt",2019/6/18,Book Proceedings of the 10th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference,"360 video streaming is gaining popularity because of the new type of experience it creates. Tile-based approaches have been widely used in VoD 360 video streaming to save the network bandwidth. However, they cannot be extended to the case of live streaming because they assume the 360 videos stitched offline before streaming. Instead, stitching has to be done in real-time in live 360 video streaming. More importantly, the stitching speed as shown in our experiments is one order of magnitude lower than the network transmission speed, making stitching more of a deciding factor of the overall frame rate than the network transmission speed. In this paper, we design a stitching algorithm for tile-based live 360 video streaming that adapts stitching quality to make the best use of the timing budget. There are two main challenges. First, existing tile-based approaches do not consider various semantic information in …",13

In this paper, we demonstrate that a paradigm shifting framework can be designed to systematically move the common DER local processing to the streaming server with the emergence of cloud-based video services. This framework has the potential to replace the massive per-device DER computation by a one-time global video processing in the cloud.

However, such a time lag is undesirable for timely popularity forecast as forecasting initial popularity during UGVs' lifetime is vitally important. In fact, we have found in our measurement that the most popular UGVs usually precede others starting from the beginning days and UGVs generally receive the highest attentions during the first few days.

To address these challenges, we propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based network-assisted adaptation framework, wherein cost of buffering, significant playback variation, bandwidth management and income of playback are jointly investigated.

We aim to monitor MR headset motion and infer the user input through a benign App. Realizing the attack system requires addressing unique challenges in MR such as six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) device motion and no explicit motion …",3
Deep Contextualized Compressive Offloading for Images,"Bo Chen, Zhisheng Yan, Hongpeng Guo, Zhe Yang, Ahmed Ali-Eldin, Prashant Shenoy, Klara Nahrstedt",2021/11/15,Book Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,"Recent years have witnessed sensors becoming an indispensable part of our life with the camera being one of the most popular and widely deployed sensors. The camera gives rise to numerous vision-based IoT applications that generate high-level understandings of a live video stream by performing analysis on end devices like mobile or embedded devices. Typically, these applications are built with deep learning (DL) models to conduct complex vision tasks, e.g., image classification and object detection. Due to the prohibitive cost of running DL models on end devices close to the camera and with limited computation capabilities, it is widely adopted to offload the computation to a nearby powerful edge server. However, there is a gap between the restricted offloading bandwidth of the end device and the large volume of image data incurred by the live video stream. In this paper, we present Deep Contextualized …",2
Feature fusion quality assessment model for DASH video streaming,"Hong Zhang, Fan Li, Zhisheng Yan",2021/1,Journal IET Image Processing,"Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) employs the flexible rate adaptation scheme to combat with time‐varying channel conditions. In addition to compression impairment, DASH video streaming suffers from transmission impairment, such as rate switches and stalling events. Both of them severely degrade users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Herein, an assessment model is established for DASH video streaming by directly jointing multiple QoE influential factors, which quantify impairments resulting from the compression and transmission. To demonstrate the influence of video content characteristics on users' QoE, spatio‐temporal content perceptual features are employed to represent the compression impairment. When reflecting temporal characteristics, a novel motion vector padding method is proposed to quantify the influence of intra macroblock on the human visual system. The proposed model is …",2

Dissecting Latency in 360° Video Camera Sensing Systems,"Zhisheng Yan, Jun Yi",2022/8/11,Journal Sensors,"360° video camera sensing is an increasingly popular technology. Compared with traditional 2D video systems, it is challenging to ensure the viewing experience in 360° video camera sensing because the massive omnidirectional data introduce adverse effects on start-up delay, event-to-eye delay, and frame rate. Therefore, understanding the time consumption of computing tasks in 360° video camera sensing becomes the prerequisite to improving the system’s delay performance and viewing experience. Despite the prior measurement studies on 360° video systems, none of them delves into the system pipeline and dissects the latency at the task level. In this paper, we perform the first in-depth measurement study of task-level time consumption for 360° video camera sensing. We start with identifying the subtle relationship between the three delay metrics and the time consumption breakdown across the system computing task. Next, we develop an open research prototype Zeus to characterize this relationship in various realistic usage scenarios. Our measurement of task-level time consumption demonstrates the importance of the camera CPU-GPU transfer and the server initialization, as well as the negligible effect of 360° video stitching on the delay metrics. Finally, we compare Zeus with a commercial system to validate that our results are representative and can be used to improve today’s 360° video camera sensing systems.",1
Embedding pose information for multiview vehicle model recognition,"Ye Yu, Haitao Liu, Yuanzi Fu, Wei Jia, Jun Yu, Zhisheng Yan",2022/2/11,Journal IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,"Vehicle model recognition is a typical fine-grained classification task that has a wide range of application prospects in safe cities and constitutes a research hotspot in the field of computer vision. Vehicles in images can appear at various angles, resulting in large differences in appearance. The existence of “multiviews” renders vehicle model recognition challenging. Recent research on vehicle model recognition has not fully explored the pose information of vehicles in different images, resulting in low model performance. In this study, we use vehicle pose information to solve the multiview vehicle model recognition (MV-VMR) problem and design a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with embedded vehicle pose information, known as the embedding pose CNN (EP-CNN). The proposed model includes two subnetworks: the pose estimation subnetwork (PE-SubNet) and vehicle model classification …",1
Collaborative Video Analytics on Distributed Edges with Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Yuqi Dong, Guanyu Gao, Ran Wang, Zhisheng Yan",2022/11/6,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.03102,"Deep Neural Network (DNN) based video analytics empowers many computer vision-based applications to achieve high recognition accuracy. To reduce inference delay and bandwidth cost for video analytics, the DNN models can be deployed on the edge nodes, which are proximal to end users. However, the processing capacity of an edge node is limited, potentially incurring substantial delay if the inference requests on an edge node is overloaded. While efforts have been made to enhance video analytics by optimizing the configurations on a single edge node, we observe that multiple edge nodes can work collaboratively by utilizing the idle resources on each other to improve the overall processing capacity and resource utilization. To this end, we propose a Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based approach, named as EdgeVision, for collaborative video analytics on distributed edges. The edge nodes can jointly learn the optimal policies for video preprocessing, model selection, and request dispatching by collaborating with each other to minimize the overall cost. We design an actor-critic-based MARL algorithm with an attention mechanism to learn the optimal policies. We build a multi-edge-node testbed and conduct experiments with real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of our method. The experimental results show our method can improve the overall rewards by 33.6%-86.4% compared with the most competitive baseline methods.",
DAO: Dynamic Adaptive Offloading for Video Analytics,"Taslim Murad, Anh Nguyen, Zhisheng Yan",2022/10/10,Book Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Multimedia,"Offloading videos from end devices to edge or cloud servers is the key to enabling computation-intensive video analytics. To ensure the analytics accuracy at the server, the video quality for offloading must be configured based on the specific content and the available network bandwidth. While adaptive video streaming for user viewing has been widely studied, none of the existing works can guarantee the analytics accuracy at the server in bandwidth- and content-adaptive way. To fill in this gap, this paper presents DAO, a dynamic adaptive offloading framework for video analytics that jointly considers the dynamics of network bandwidth and video content. DAO is able to maximize the analytics accuracy at the server by adapting the video bitrate and resolution dynamically. In essence, we shift the context of adaptive video transport from traditional DASH systems to a new dynamic adaptive offloading framework …",
A novel transmission approach based on video content for 360-degree streaming,"Hong Zhang, Fan Li, Zhisheng Yan",2022/9,Journal Multimedia Tools and Applications,"Because of the immersive experience provided, 360-degree video is developing rapidly. However, high data volume is needed to create the panoramic video for the end-user, which conflicts with the limited transmission resources. In this paper, we present a novel transmission approach based on video content to guarantee an acceptable objective video quality for end-users by reusing the transmitted video data, in which transmission resources are saved by transmitting part of video data. The approach is designed to address challenges, such as the increment of video data volume from the tile-based encoding and the inconsistency between transmitted tiles and the viewed region using a single mode of tile partition. We also employ public network traces to simulate the network condition in our work. Simulated results show that our proposed approach can save bandwidth of  only at the price of slightly …",
A 360-Degree Video Analytics Service for In-Classroom Firefighter Training,"Ayush Sarkar, Anh Nguyen, Zhisheng Yan, Klara Nahrstedt",2022/5/3,Conference 2022 Workshop on Cyber Physical Systems for Emergency Response (CPS-ER),"Demonstrating firefighting operations in search and rescue missions through videos is a common approach to in-classroom firefighter training. Unfortunately, traditional 2D cameras have fundamental weaknesses – they can only capture a narrow field of view and miss a lot of information coming from the surroundings of the firefighter, which may become the matter of life and death in certain situations. In this paper, we propose a system combining the advantage of 360° videos and deep learning to automatically detect important objects in the panoramic scene, assisting firefighting instructors in classroom teaching scenarios. Specifically, we summarize the salient objects and events relevant to firefighting through an interview with an experienced firefighting instructor. Leveraging this knowledge, we investigate the detection of firefighting objects on 360° videos through a transfer learning approach. We report insightful …",

Sustained Mobile Visual Computing: A Human-Centered Perspective,Zhisheng Yan,2017,Institution State University of New York at Buffalo,"Visual content is the most natural abstraction of the real world. Interacting with various types of visual content via mobile devices at anytime and anywhere promises the future of mobile computing. Such sustained mobile visual computing will revolutionize cyber-physical systems, especially the cyber-human interaction, in numerous applications from education and entertainment to infrastructure and healthcare monitoring. However, today’s systems, highly optimized for simple graphic user interface or stationary devices, fail to achieve the energy and bandwidth efficiency required by this long-term vision. In this dissertation, we propose a human-centered perspective to bridge this gap by understanding the human perception of the dynamic visual content under the specific mobile context.",
Computationally Recoverable Camouflage: A Universal Model for Privacy-Aware Location-Based Services,"Changsha Ma, Zhisheng Yan, Chang Wen Chen",2016/3/24,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.07711,"With the prevalence of location-based services (LBSs) supported by advanced positioning technology, there is a dramatic increase in the transmission of high-precision personal geographical data. Malicious use of these sensitive data will threaten the privacy of LBS users. Although privacy research in LBSs has received wide attention, related works are mostly focused on some specific applications. Due to high diversity of LBSs, it is critical to build a universal model that is able to handle privacy protection for broader range of applications. In this paper, we propose a Computationally Recoverable Camouflage (CRC) model, where LBS users can preserve privacy by reporting camouflaged location information and are able to flexibly leverage between the service quality and the achieved privacy in different applications by adjusting the precision of the camouflage information. In particular, we propose a novel camouflage algorithm with formal privacy guarantee that considers both location context and social context, enabling LBS users to scalably expose camouflage information in terms of two dimensions. Furthermore, we apply the Scalable Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (SCP-ABE) algorithm to enforce fine-grained access control on the two-dimensional-scalable camouflage information. Through successful implementations on Android devices, we have demonstrated the computational efficiency of the proposed CRC model.",
