Monocular vision-based human following on miniature robotic blimp,"Ningshi Yao, Emily Anaya, Qiuyang Tao, Sungjin Cho, Hongrui Zheng, Fumin Zhang",2017/5/29,Conference 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),"We present an approach that allows the Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimp (GT-MAB) to detect and follow a human. This accomplishment is the first Human Robot Interaction (HRI) demonstration between an uninstrumented human and a robotic blimp. GT-MAB is an ideal platform for HRI missions because it is safe to humans and can support sufficient flight time for HRI experiments. However, due to complex aerodynamic influence on the blimp, the human following task for GT-MAB with a single on-board camera is a challenging problem. We integrate Haar face detector and KLT feature tracker to achieve robust human tracking. After a human face is detected in the real-time video stream, we estimated the 3D positions of the human with respect to GT-MAB. Visionbased PID controllers are designed based on estimated relative position and the motion primitives of GT-MAB such that it can achieve stable and …",59
Autonomous flying blimp interaction with human in an indoor space,"Ningshi Yao, Qiuyang Tao, Weiyu Liu, Zhen Liu, Ye Tian, Peiyu Wang, Timothy Li, Fumin Zhang",2019/1,Journal Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering,"We present the Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimp (GT-MAB), which is designed to support human-robot interaction experiments in an indoor space for up to two hours. GT-MAB is safe while flying in close proximity to humans. It is able to detect the face of a human subject, follow the human, and recognize hand gestures. GT-MAB employs a deep neural network based on the single shot multibox detector to jointly detect a human user’s face and hands in a real-time video stream collected by the onboard camera. A human-robot interaction procedure is designed and tested with various human users. The learning algorithms recognize two hand waving gestures. The human user does not need to wear any additional tracking device when interacting with the flying blimp. Vision-based feedback controllers are designed to control the blimp to follow the human and fly in one of two distinguishable …",21
Resolving contentions for intelligent traffic intersections using optimal priority assignment and model predictive control,"Ningshi Yao, Fumin Zhang",2018/8/21,Conference 2018 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA),"We address the problem of optimally scheduling automated vehicles crossing an urban intersection by assigning vehicles with priorities. We formulate the intersection scheduling problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem which co-designs the priority and traveling speed for each vehicle. The co-design aims to minimize the vehicle waiting time at the intersection area, under a set of safety constraints. To solve the problem, we present a contention-resolving Model Predictive Control (MPC) method to dynamically assign priorities and compute the optimal speed for each vehicle based on the assigned priorities. The optimal priority assignment can be determined using a sampling based approach. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulation and shows reductions in traveling time.",10
Scheduling feasibility of energy management in micro-grids based on significant moment analysis,"Zhenwu Shi, Ningshi Yao, Fumin Zhang",2017/1/1,Book Cyber-physical systems,"This chapter studies the operation and scheduling of electric loads in micro-grid, a highly automated and distributed cyber-physical energy system. We establish rigorous mathematical expressions for electric loads and battery banks in the micro-grid by considering their characteristics and constraints. Based on these mathematical models, we propose a novel real-time scheduling analysis method for priority-based energy management in micro-grid, named significant moments analysis (SMA). SMA pinpoints all the crucial moments when electrical operations are requested among the micro-grid and establishes a dynamic model to describe the scheduling behavior of electric loads. Using SMA, we can check the scheduling feasibility and predict whether the micro-grid can generate enough power to support the execution of electric loads. In the case where the power is insufficient to supply load demands, SMA can …",9
Contention resolving optimal priority assignment for event-triggered model predictive controllers,"Ningshi Yao, Michael Malisoff, Fumin Zhang",2017/5/24,Conference 2017 American Control Conference (ACC),"Priority-based scheduling strategies are often used to resolve contentions in resource constrained networked control systems (NCSs). Such scheduling strategies inevitably introduce time delays into controls. Considering the coupling between priority assignment and control, this paper proposes a novel method to co-design priority assignments and controls for each control loop in NCSs. The co-design aims to minimize the performance degradation caused by time delays. The priority assignment is determined by a path planning approach to search for optimal priority assignments. Model predictive controllers are designed based on optimizing priority assignments to compute optimal controls. Simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",6
Contention-resolving model predictive control for coupled control systems with a shared resource,"Ningshi Yao, Michael Malisoff, Fumin Zhang",2020/12/1,Journal Automatica,"Priority-based scheduling strategies are often used to resolve contentions in resource constrained control systems. Such scheduling strategies inevitably introduce time delays into controls and may degrade the performance of control systems. Considering the coupling between priority assignment and control, this paper presents a method to co-design priority assignments and control laws for each control system, which aims to minimize the overall performance degradation caused by contentions. The co-design problem is formulated as a mixed integer optimization problem with a very large search space, rendering difficulty in computing the optimal solution. To solve the problem, we develop a novel contention-resolving model predictive control method to dynamically assign priorities and compute an optimal control. The priority assignment can be determined using a sample-based approach without excessive …",5
Modeling the effect of nanoparticles & the bistability of transmembrane potential in non-excitable cells,"Muhammad Asif Rana, Ningshi Yao, Shayok Mukhopadhyay, Fumin Zhang, Emilie Warren, Christine Payne",2016/7/6,Conference 2016 American Control Conference (ACC),"We present a simple dynamical model for the transmembrane potential in non-excitable mammalian cells. This model allows us to mimic the effect of nanoparticles on the transmembrane potential, by decreasing the permeability of potassium ion channels. We show that our model agrees with the trends observed in our experiments. However, it also exhibits opposing trends under certain conditions, which were not seen in the experiments. This indicates that the membrane potential can be bistable. We analyze the cellular conditions which may cause this apparent bistability. The effects of adding nanoparticles on sodium and chloride ion channels are also studied using the proposed model. We hypothesize that nanoparticles may also block the sodium and chloride ion channels but the extent of blockage of these ion channels may differ from that of potassium ion channels.",5
Contention-resolving model predictive control for an intelligent intersection traffic model,"Ningshi Yao, Fumin Zhang",2021/9,Journal Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,"We address the problem of optimally scheduling automated vehicles crossing an intelligent intersection by assigning vehicles with priorities and desired speed. An idealized intersection traffic model is established for the development and verification of the required algorithms. We formulate the intersection scheduling problem as a mixed integer programming (or MIP) problem which co-designs the priority and traveling speed for each vehicle. The co-design aims to minimize the vehicle waiting time at the intersection area, under a set of safety constraints. We derived a contention-resolving model predictive control (or MPC) algorithm to dynamically assign priorities and compute the vehicles’ traveling speeds.

Contention-resolving model predictive control for coordinating automated vehicles at a traffic intersection,"Ningshi Yao, Michael Malisoff, Fumin Zhang",2019/12/11,Conference 2019 IEEE 58th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"Our earlier work established a contention-resolving model predictive control (MPC) framework for codesigning priorities and speeds for automated vehicles at an intersection. In this paper, we present an improved contention-resolving MPC design. We propose a new branch cost formulation for the decision tree that is constructed by contentionresolving MPC to handle the case where a vehicle is delayed multiple times before being allowed access to the intersection. All possible priority combinations are dynamically generated when constructing the decision tree. Based on the priority assignments, we design a decentralized control law to control vehicle speeds, which we show enjoys optimality properties under a specific priority assignment. We verify the effectiveness of our method through a simulation and a comparison with the First-Come-First-Serve scheduling strategy.",4
Optimal real-time scheduling of human attention for a human and multi-robot collaboration system,"Ningshi Yao, Fumin Zhang",2020/7/1,Conference 2020 American Control Conference (ACC),"We analyze a human and multi-robot collaboration system and propose a method to optimally schedule the human attention when a human operator receives collaboration requests from multiple robots at the same time. We formulate the human attention scheduling problem as a binary optimization problem which aims to maximize the overall performance among all the robots, under the constraint that a human has limited attention capacity. We first present the optimal schedule for the human to determine when to collaborate with a robot if there is no contention occurring among robots' collaboration requests. For the moments when contentions occur, we present a contention-resolving Model Predictive Control (MPC) method to dynamically schedule the human attention and determine which robot the human should collaborate with first. The optimal schedule can then be determined using a sampling based …",3
Observability Analysis and Reduced-Order Observer Design for a Super-Coiled Polymer-Driven Robotic Eye,"Sunil Kumar Rajendran, Qi Wei, Ningshi Yao, Feitian Zhang",2022/12/6,Conference 2022 IEEE 61st Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"With the aid of a robotic eye platform, several ocular motor disorders such as strabismus can be studied by ophthalmologists and biomedical researchers to better under-stand the biomechanisms of the human eye. Our previous work modeled a 2-DOF robotic eye driven by Super-Coiled Polymer (SCP) artificial muscles and presented a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) learning-based controller. The control policy requires access to the full system states that include the orientation of the robotic eye and temperature changes of the SCPs. While the angular orientations of the robotic eye can be determined using embedded sensors or image-processing of the visual feed, it is quite laborious and expensive to measure the temperatures of the slender SCP muscles without affecting robot dynamics. To address this problem, this paper designs a linear reduced-order state observer based on the linearization of …",
Modeling and Learning-Based Control for Super-Coiled Polymer-Driven Robotic Eye,"Sunil Kumar Rajendran, Qi Wei, Ningshi Yao, Feitian Zhang",2022/6/8,Conference 2022 American Control Conference (ACC),"A newly-developed type of artificial muscles – Super-Coiled Polymer (SCP), comparatively offers many advantages in terms of cost, size, flexibility, fabrication, and power-to-weight ratio, potentially making SCPs a great fit for deployment in bioinspired robots. Development of bioinspired robots incorporating artificial muscles, increasingly necessitates derivation of precise dynamic models for motion prediction and controller design. Nevertheless, the process of modeling the system dynamics of such sophisticatedly evolving robots becomes difficult due to their continuum dynamics and high dimensionality. To address the problems of high nonlinearity and intrinsically infinite system dimension, contemporary artificial intelligence techniques, specifically reinforcement learning algorithms, are employed to design learning-based controllers. This necessity of developing intelligent control serves as the motivation to not …",
Event-triggered Scheduling and Control Co-design for Networked Control Systems with Sub-schedulability,"Ningshi Yao, Fumin Zhang",2022/6/8,Conference 2022 American Control Conference (ACC),"We propose a new concept named sub-schedulability to relax schedulability conditions on task sets in the context of scheduling and control co-design. Sub-schedulability is less conservative compared to schedulablity requirement with respect to network utilization. But it can still guarantee that all tasks can be executed before or within a bounded time interval after their deadlines. Based on the sub-schedulability concept, we derive an analytical timing model to check the sub-schedulability and perform online prediction of time-delays caused by real-time scheduling. A modified event-triggered contention-resolving MPC is presented to co-design the scheduling and control for the sub-schedulable control tasks. Simulation results are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
From Instantaneous Schedulability to Worst Case Schedulability: A Significant Moment Approach,"Ningshi Yao, Fumin Zhang",2021/9/11,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.05375,"The method of significant moment analysis has been employed to derive instantaneous schedulability tests for real-time systems. However, the instantaneous schedulability can only be checked within a finite time window. On the other hand, worst-case schedulability guarantees schedulability of systems for infinite time. This paper derives the classical worst-case schedulability conditions for preemptive periodic systems starting from instantaneous schedulability, hence unifying the two notions of schedulability. The results provide a rigorous justification on the critical time instants being the worst case for scheduling of preemptive periodic systems. The paper also show that the critical time instant is not the only worst case moments.",
Adaptiveness and consistency of a class of online ensemble learning algorithms,"Carol Young, Ningshi Yao, Fumin Zhang",2021/4,Journal International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control,"Expert based ensemble learning algorithms often serve as online learning algorithms for an unknown, possibly time‐varying, probability distribution. Their simplicity allows flexibility in design choices, leading to variations that balance adaptiveness and consistency. This article provides an analytical framework to quantify the adaptiveness and consistency of expert based ensemble learning algorithms. With properly selected states, the algorithms are modeled as a Markov chains. Then quantitative metrics of adaptiveness and consistency can be calculated through mathematical formulas, other than relying on numerical simulations. Results are derived for several popular ensemble learning algorithms. Success of the method has also been demonstrated in both simulation and experimental results.",

Avoiding Chatter in an Online Co-Learning Algorithm Predicting Human Intention,"Carol Young, Ningshi Yao, Fumin Zhang",2019/12/11,Conference 2019 IEEE 58th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"Chatter can happen when an online learning algorithm is used by a robot to predict human intention while interacting with a human subject. When chatter happens, the learning algorithm continually changes its prediction, without reaching a constant prediction of human intention. Using the Rescorla-Wagner model for human learning, we analyze an expert based online learning algorithm and identify an invariant set in the state and parameter space where chatter will occur. Based on the chatter analysis, we also propose an improved expert based learning algorithm where the invariant set does not exist so that chatter can be avoided.",
