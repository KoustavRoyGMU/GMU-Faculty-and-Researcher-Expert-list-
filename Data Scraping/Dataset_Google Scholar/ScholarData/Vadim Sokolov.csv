Deep learning for short-term traffic flow prediction,"Nicholas Polson, Vadim Sokolov",2017/6,Journal Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,"We develop a deep learning model to predict traffic flows. The main contribution is development of an architecture that combines a linear model that is fitted using ℓ 1 regularization and a sequence of tanh layers. The challenge of predicting traffic flows are the sharp nonlinearities due to transitions between free flow, breakdown, recovery and congestion. We show that deep learning architectures can capture these nonlinear spatio-temporal effects. The first layer identifies spatio-temporal relations among predictors and other layers model nonlinear relations. We illustrate our methodology on road sensor data from Interstate I-55 and predict traffic flows during two special events; a Chicago Bears football game and an extreme snowstorm event. Both cases have sharp traffic flow regime changes, occurring very suddenly, and we show how deep learning provides precise short term traffic flow predictions.",880

Deep learning: A Bayesian perspective,"Nicholas G Polson, Vadim Sokolov",2017/12/1,Volume 12,"Deep learning is a form of machine learning for nonlinear high dimensional pattern matching and prediction. By taking a Bayesian probabilistic perspective, we provide a number of insights into more efficient algorithms for optimisation and hyper-parameter tuning. Traditional high-dimensional data reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), reduced rank regression (RRR), projection pursuit regression (PPR) are all shown to be shallow learners. Their deep learning counterparts exploit multiple deep layers of data reduction which provide predictive performance gains. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training optimisation and Dropout (DO) regularization provide estimation and variable selection. Bayesian regularization is central to finding weights and connections in networks to optimize the predictive bias-variance trade-off. To illustrate our methodology …",116
Analysis of the effects of connected–automated vehicle technologies on travel demand,"Joshua Auld, Vadim Sokolov, Thomas S Stephens",2017,Journal Transportation Research Record,"Connected–automated vehicle (CAV) technologies are likely to have significant effects not only on how vehicles operate in the transportation system, but also on how individuals behave and use their vehicles. While many CAV technologies—such as connected adaptive cruise control and ecosignals—have the potential to increase network throughput and efficiency, many of these same technologies have a secondary effect of reducing driver burden, which can drive changes in travel behavior. Such changes in travel behavior—in effect, lowering the cost of driving—have the potential to increase greatly the utilization of the transportation system with concurrent negative externalities, such as congestion, energy use, and emissions, working against the positive effects on the transportation system resulting from increased capacity. To date, few studies have analyzed the potential effects on CAV technologies from a …",103
Deep learning for spatio‐temporal modeling: dynamic traffic flows and high frequency trading,"Matthew F Dixon, Nicholas G Polson, Vadim O Sokolov",2019/5,Journal Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry,"Deep learning applies hierarchical layers of hidden variables to construct nonlinear high dimensional predictors. Our goal is to develop and train deep learning architectures for spatio‐temporal modeling. Training a deep architecture is achieved by stochastic gradient descent and dropout for parameter regularization with a goal of minimizing out‐of‐sample predictive mean squared error. To illustrate our methodology, we first predict the sharp discontinuities in traffic flow data, and secondly, we develop a classification rule to predict short‐term futures market prices using order book depth.

Coordinated platoon routing in a metropolitan network,"Jeffrey Larson, Todd Munson, Vadim Sokolov",2016,Book 2016 proceedings of the seventh siam workshop on combinatorial scientific computing,"Platooning vehicles—connected and automated vehicles traveling with small intervehicle distances—use less fuel because of reduced aerodynamic drag. Given a network defined by vertex and edge sets and a set of vehicles with origin/destination nodes/times, we model and solve the combinatorial optimization problem of coordinated routing of vehicles in a manner that routes them to their destination on time while using the least amount of fuel. Common approaches decompose the platoon coordination and vehicle routing into separate problems. Our model addresses both problems simultaneously to obtain the best solution. We use modern modeling techniques and constraints implied from analyzing the platoon routing problem to address larger numbers of vehicles and larger networks than previously considered.

An optimization technique for damped model updating with measured data satisfying quadratic orthogonality constraint,"Biswa Nath Datta, S Deng, VO Sokolov, DR Sarkissian",2009/8/1,Journal Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing,"A two-stage optimization procedure for matrix updating of a damped finite element model in structural dynamics is proposed. In Stage I, the measured data is updated to satisfy a recently established orthogonality relation between the eigenvectors of a quadratic matrix pencil associated with the model. This updated data is then used in Stage II to update the stiffness matrix so that (i) the updated model reproduces the measured data, and (ii) the symmetry of the original model is preserved. The results of the paper generalize some well known and recent results in several ways. Our contribution also includes mathematically proved results to demonstrate that Stage I is essential to obtain a symmetric updated matrix K in Stage II, unless, of course, the measured eigenvector matrix is such that the orthogonality constraint has been already satisfied, which is extremely unlikely to happen in practice.",41

Bayesian analysis of traffic flow on interstate I-55: The LWR model,"Nicholas Polson, Vadim Sokolov",2015/12/1,Volume 9," Transportation departments take actions to manage traffic flow and reduce travel times based on estimated current and projected traffic conditions. Travel time estimates and forecasts require information on traffic density which are combined with a model to project traffic flow such as the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) model. We develop a particle filtering and learning algorithm to estimate the current traffic density state and the LWR parameters. These inputs are related to the so-called fundamental diagram, which describes the relationship between traffic flow and density. We build on existing methodology by allowing real-time updating of the posterior uncertainty for the critical density and capacity parameters. Our methodology is applied to traffic flow data from interstate highway I-55 in Chicago.

Bayesian particle tracking of traffic flows,"Nicholas Polson, Vadim Sokolov",2017/2/13,Journal IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,"We develop a Bayesian particle filter for tracking traffic flows that is capable of capturing non-linearities and discontinuities present in flow dynamics. Our model includes a hidden state variable that captures sudden regime shifts between traffic free flow, breakdown, and recovery. We develop an efficient particle learning algorithm for real time online inference of states and parameters. This requires a two-step approach, first resampling the current particles with a mixture predictive distribution and second propagation of states using the conditional posterior distribution. Particle learning of parameters follows from updating recursions for conditional sufficient statistics. To illustrate our methodology, we analyze the measurements of daily traffic flow from the Illinois Interstate I-55 highway system. We demonstrate how our filter can be used to infer the change of traffic flow regime on a highway road segment based on a …",32
Maximization of platoon formation through centralized routing and departure time coordination,"Vadim Sokolov, Jeffrey Larson, Todd Munson, Josh Auld, Dominik Karbowski",2017,Journal Transportation Research Record,"Platooning allows vehicles to travel with a small intervehicle distance in a coordinated fashion because of vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity. When applied at a larger scale, platooning creates significant opportunities for energy savings because of reduced aerodynamic drag, as well as increased road capacity and a reduction in congestion resulting from shorter vehicle headways. These potential savings are maximized, however, if platooning-capable vehicles spend most of their travel time within platoons. Ad hoc platoon formation may not ensure a high rate of platoon driving. This paper considers the problem of central coordination of platooning-capable vehicles. Coordination of their routes and departure times can maximize the fuel savings afforded by platooning vehicles. The resulting problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that considers the platoon coordination and vehicle routing problems …",31
A solution of the affine quadratic inverse eigenvalue problem,"Biswa Nath Datta, Vadim Sokolov",2011/4/1,Journal Linear Algebra and its Applications,"The quadratic inverse eigenvalue problem (QIEP) is to find the three matrices M,C, and K, given a set of numbers, closed under complex conjugations, such that these numbers become the eigenvalues of the quadratic pencil P(λ)=λ2M+λC+K. The affine inverse quadratic eigenvalue problem (AQIEP) is the QIEP with an additional constraint that the coefficient matrices belong to an affine family, that is, these matrices are linear combinations of substructured matrices. An affine family of matrices very often arise in vibration engineering modeling and analysis. Research on QIEP and AQIEP are still at developing stage. In this paper, we propose three methods and the associated mathematical theories for solving AQIEP: A Newton method, an alternating projections method, and a hybrid method combining the two. Validity of these methods are illustrated with results on numerical experiments on a spring-mass problem …",27
FakeTables: Using GANs to Generate Functional Dependency Preserving Tables with Bounded Real Data.,"Haipeng Chen, Sushil Jajodia, Jing Liu, Noseong Park, Vadim Sokolov, VS Subrahmanian",2019/8/10,Conference IJCAI,"In many cases, an organization wishes to release some data, but is restricted in the amount of data to be released due to legal, privacy and other concerns. For instance, the US Census Bureau releases only 1% of its table of records every year, along with statistics about the entire table. However, the machine learning (ML) models trained on the released sub-table are usually sub-optimal. In this paper, our goal is to find a way to augment the subtable by generating a synthetic table from the released sub-table, under the constraints that the generated synthetic table (i) has similar statistics as the entire table, and (ii) preserves the functional dependencies of the released sub-table. We propose a novel generative adversarial network framework called ITS-GAN, where both the generator and the discriminator are specifically designed to satisfy these two constraints. By evaluating the augmentation performance of ITS-GAN on two representative datasets, the US Census Bureau data and US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) data, we show that ITS-GAN yields high quality classification results, and significantly outperforms various state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches.",24

Bayesian optimization for transportation simulators,"Laura Schultz, Vadim Sokolov",2018/1/1,Journal Procedia computer science,"Mobility dynamics in urban transportation systems is governed by a large number of travelers that act according to their utilities, preferences and biases. The mobility patterns that we observe are the results of the emerging traveler’s behaviors and, in practice, we develop models that represents mobility patterns and their resulting traffic flows. Models, however, can only approximate the processes they represent and often times do not reproduce exact matches to the true system’s observed data. Systematic adjustments, or calibrations, to the model and its input variables may be required to align the associated outputs more closely with their true values.

Vehicle energy management optimization through digital maps and connectivity,"Dominik Karbowski, Vadim Sokolov, Aymeric Rousseau",2015/10/1,"Publisher Argonne National Lab.(ANL), Argonne, IL (United States)","There is an opportunity for using digital maps with real-time updates to improve the energy management of vehicles. In this paper, we present research on how this can be achieved in the particular case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. With perfect knowledge of the trip ahead, it is possible to find the optimal control of the vehicle. Digital maps, however, provide only averaged information about the future itinerary, such as locations of stops, types of intersection, and average speeds. First, we demonstrate how we can generate naturalistic speed profiles for a given itinerary. We do so by augmenting the information from digital maps by actual recorded speeds from a travel survey and Markov chains. Second, we detail how these speed profiles can be used for control optimization. We use the Pontryagin minimum principle to optimally tune the vehicle energy management and then evaluate the actual fuel savings using the Autonomie simulation tool.",19
A flexible framework for developing integrated models of transportation systems using an agent-based approach,"Vadim Sokolov, Joshua Auld, Michael Hope",2012/1/1,Journal Procedia Computer Science,"Travel demand, traffic flow and land-use models are typically modeled in a decoupled way, ie each of the components is modeled separately assuming that parameters related to the other components are fixed.

Deep reinforcement learning for dynamic urban transportation problems,"Laura Schultz, Vadim Sokolov",2018/6/14,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.05310,"We explore the use of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for optimization problems in transportation. Many transportation system analysis tasks are formulated as an optimization problem - such as optimal control problems in intelligent transportation systems and long term urban planning. Often transportation models used to represent dynamics of a transportation system involve large data sets with complex input-output interactions and are difficult to use in the context of optimization. Use of deep learning metamodels can produce a lower dimensional representation of those relations and allow to implement optimization and reinforcement learning algorithms in an efficient manner. In particular, we develop deep learning models for calibrating transportation simulators and for reinforcement learning to solve the problem of optimal scheduling of travelers on the network.",13

Investigating water quality data using principal component analysis and granger causality,"Maryam Zavareh, Viviana Maggioni, Vadim Sokolov",2021/1/30,Journal Water,"This work investigates the inter-relationships among stream water quality indicators, hydroclimatic variables (e.g., precipitation, river discharge), and land characteristics (e.g., soil type, land use), which is crucial to developing effective methods for water quality protection. The potential of using statistical tools, such as Principal Component (PC) and Granger causality analyses, for this purpose is assessed across 10 watersheds in the Eastern United States. The PC analysis shows consistency across the ten locations, with most of the variation explained by the first two PCs, except for the least developed watershed that presents three PCs. Results show that stronger Granger causality relationships and correlation coefficients are identified when considering a lag of one day, compared to longer lags. This is mainly due to the watersheds’ limited size and, thus, their fast hydrological response. The strongest Granger causalities are observed when water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration are considered as the effect of the other variables, which corroborates the importance of these two water properties. This work also demonstrates how watershed size and land use can impact causalities between hydrometeorological variables and water quality, thus, highlighting how complex these relationships are even in a region characterized by overall similar climatology.",11

Deep learning partial least squares,"Nicholas Polson, Vadim Sokolov, Jianeng Xu",2021/6/26,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.14085,"High dimensional data reduction techniques are provided by using partial least squares within deep learning. Our framework provides a nonlinear extension of PLS together with a disciplined approach to feature selection and architecture design in deep learning. This leads to a statistical interpretation of deep learning that is tailor made for predictive problems. We can use the tools of PLS, such as scree-plot, bi-plot to provide model diagnostics. Posterior predictive uncertainty is available using MCMC methods at the last layer. Thus we achieve the best of both worlds: scalability and fast predictive rule construction together with uncertainty quantification. Our key construct is to employ deep learning within PLS by predicting the output scores as a deep learner of the input scores. As with PLS our X-scores are constructed using SVD and applied to both regression and classification problems and are fast and scalable. Following Frank and Friedman 1993, we provide a Bayesian shrinkage interpretation of our nonlinear predictor. We introduce a variety of new partial least squares models: PLS-ReLU, PLS-Autoencoder, PLS-Trees and PLS-GP.

Effects of Predictive Real-Time Traffic Signal Information,"Vadim Sokolov, Muhammad Imran, David W Etherington, Dominik Karbowski, Aymeric Rousseau",2018/11/4,Conference 2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),"This paper analyzes the impact of providing car drivers with predictive information on traffic signal timing in real-time, including time-to-green and green-wave speed recommendations. Over a period of six months, the behavior of these 121 drivers in everyday urban driving was analyzed with and without access to live traffic signal information. In a first period, drivers had the information providing service disabled in order to establish a baseline behavior; after that initial phase, the service was activated. In both cases, data from smartphone and vehicle sensors was collected, including speed, acceleration, fuel rate, acceleration and brake pedal positions. We estimated the changes in the driving behavior which result from drivers' receiving the traffic signal timing information by carefully comparing distributions of acceleration/deceleration patterns through statistical analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that there is a …",3

Merging two cultures: deep and statistical learning,"Anindya Bhadra, Jyotishka Datta, Nick Polson, Vadim Sokolov, Jianeng Xu",2021/10/22,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.11561,"Merging the two cultures of deep and statistical learning provides insights into structured high-dimensional data. Traditional statistical modeling is still a dominant strategy for structured tabular data. Deep learning can be viewed through the lens of generalized linear models (GLMs) with composite link functions. Sufficient dimensionality reduction (SDR) and sparsity performs nonlinear feature engineering. We show that prediction, interpolation and uncertainty quantification can be achieved using probabilistic methods at the output layer of the model. Thus a general framework for machine learning arises that first generates nonlinear features (a.k.a factors) via sparse regularization and stochastic gradient optimisation and second uses a stochastic output layer for predictive uncertainty. Rather than using shallow additive architectures as in many statistical models, deep learning uses layers of semi affine input transformations to provide a predictive rule. Applying these layers of transformations leads to a set of attributes (a.k.a features) to which predictive statistical methods can be applied. Thus we achieve the best of both worlds: scalability and fast predictive rule construction together with uncertainty quantification. Sparse regularisation with un-supervised or supervised learning finds the features. We clarify the duality between shallow and wide models such as PCA, PPR, RRR and deep but skinny architectures such as autoencoders, MLPs, CNN, and LSTM. The connection with data transformations is of practical importance for finding good network architectures. By incorporating probabilistic components at the output level we allow for predictive …",2
Scalable data augmentation for deep learning,"Yuexi Wang, Nicholas G Polson, Vadim O Sokolov",2019/3,Journal arXiv e-prints,"Scalable Data Augmentation (SDA) provides a framework for training deep learning models using auxiliary hidden layers. Scalable MCMC is available for network training and inference. SDA provides a number of computational advantages over traditional algorithms, such as avoiding backtracking, local modes and can perform optimization with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in TensorFlow. Standard deep neural networks with logit, ReLU and SVM activation functions are straightforward to implement. To illustrate our architectures and methodology, we use Pólya-Gamma logit data augmentation for a number of standard datasets. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",2
Sequential Bayesian Learning for Merton's Jump Model with Stochastic Volatility,"Eric Jacquier, Nicholas Polson, Vadim Sokolov",2016/10/31,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.09750,"Jump stochastic volatility models are central to financial econometrics for volatility forecasting, portfolio risk management, and derivatives pricing. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are computationally unfeasible for the sequential learning of volatility state variables and parameters, whereby the investor must update all posterior and predictive densities as new information arrives. We develop a particle filtering and learning algorithm to sample posterior distribution in Merton's jump stochastic volatility. This allows to filter spot volatilities and jump times, together with sequentially updating (learning) of jump and volatility parameters. We illustrate our methodology on Google's stock return.

Assessing the energy impact of traffic management and vehicle hybridisation,"Dominik Karbowski, Namwook Kim, Joshua Auld, Vadim Sokolov",2016,Journal International Journal of Complexity in Applied Science and Technology,"We provide a review of methodologies previously used to evaluate impacts of transportation systems and changes in transportation infrastructure on energy consumption.

Reservoir model optimization under uncertainty,"Sasanka Are, Paul Dostert, Bree Ettinger, Juan Liu, Vadim Sokolov, Ang Wei, Klaus Wiegand",1999,"Description Computerized reservoir simulation models are widely used in the industry to forecast the behavior of hydrocarbon reservoirs and connected surface facilities over long production periods. These simulation models are increasingly complex and costly to build and often use millions of individual cells in their discretization of the reservoir volume. Simulation processing time and memory requirements increase constantly and even the utilization of ever faster computers cannot stem the growth of simulation turnaround time.On the other hand, decision makers in reservoir management need to quickly assess the risks associated with a certain model and production strategy and need to come up with high/low scenarios for Net Present Value (NPV) and the likelihood of these scenarios. To achieve reduced turnaround time in this difficult environment, reservoir engineers and applied mathematicians explore ways to employ optimization techniques that use surrogate models (ie a response surface) to perform these tasks. The costly simulation model is used to seed the design space and to assist with local refinement of the surrogate model.",Computerized reservoir simulation models are widely used in the industry to forecast the behavior of hydrocarbon reservoirs and connected surface facilities over long production periods.

Bayesian Calibration for Activity Based Models,"Laura Schultz, Joshua Auld, Vadim Sokolov",2022/3/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.04414,"We consider the problem of calibration and uncertainty analysis for activity-based transportation simulators. ABMs rely on statistical models of traveler's behavior to predict travel patterns in a metropolitan area. Input parameters are typically estimated from traveler's surveys using maximum likelihood. We develop an approach that uses Gaussian process emulator to calibrate an activity-based model of a metropolitan transplantation system.

Our methodology is applied to transportation simulator of Bloomington, Illinois. We calibrate key parameters of the model and compare to the ad-hoc calibration process.",1
Deep Generative Models for Vehicle Speed Trajectories,"Farnaz Behnia, Dominik Karbowski, Vadim Sokolov",2021/12/14,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.08361,"Generating realistic vehicle speed trajectories is a crucial component in evaluating vehicle fuel economy and in predictive control of self-driving cars. Traditional generative models rely on Markov chain methods and can produce accurate synthetic trajectories but are subject to the curse of dimensionality. They do not allow to include conditional input variables into the generation process. In this paper, we show how extensions to deep generative models allow accurate and scalable generation. Proposed architectures involve recurrent and feed-forward layers and are trained using adversarial techniques. Our models are shown to perform well on generating vehicle trajectories using a model trained on GPS data from Chicago metropolitan area.",1
Feature Selection for Personalized Policy Analysis,"Maria Nareklishvili, Nicholas Polson, Vadim Sokolov",2022/12/31,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.00251,"In this paper, we propose Forest-PLS, a feature selection method for analyzing policy effect heterogeneity in a more flexible and comprehensive manner than is typically available with conventional methods. In particular, our method is able to capture policy effect heterogeneity both within and across subgroups of the population defined by observable characteristics. To achieve this, we employ partial least squares to identify target components of the population and causal forests to estimate personalized policy effects across these components. We show that the method is consistent and leads to asymptotically normally distributed policy effects. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to the data from the Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus Experiments, which were conducted in 1988-1989. The analysis reveals that financial incentives can motivate some young non-white individuals to enter the labor market. However, these incentives may also provide a temporary financial cushion for others, dissuading them from actively seeking employment. Our findings highlight the need for targeted, personalized measures for young non-white male participants.",
Deep Learning Gaussian Processes For Computer Models with Heteroskedastic and High-Dimensional Outputs,"Laura Schultz, Vadim Sokolov",2022/9/5,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.02163,"Deep Learning Gaussian Processes (DL-GP) are proposed as a methodology for analyzing (approximating) computer models that produce heteroskedastic and high-dimensional output. Computer simulation models have many areas of applications, including social-economic processes, agriculture, environmental, biology, engineering and physics problems. A deterministic transformation of inputs is performed by deep learning and predictions are calculated by traditional Gaussian Processes. We illustrate our methodology using a simulation of motorcycle accidents and simulations of an Ebola outbreak. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

On the probability of Magnus Carlsen reaching 2900,"Sohan Bendre, Shiva Maharaj, Nick Polson, Vadim Sokolov",2022/8/19,Journal Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry,"How likely is it that Magnus Carlsen will achieve his goal of a 2900 Elo rating? At what level of play does Magnus have a reasonable chance of reaching the 2900 goal? These two questions are of great current interest to Magnus and the chess community. The probabilistic properties of Elo's rating system are well known, and together with a Brownian motion model of rating evolution, we use simulation‐based methods to address these questions. Our model assesses that Magnus has a 4.5% chance of reaching 2900 if he continues his 2020–2022 level of play. However, this increases dramatically to 80$$ 80 $$% chance if he can repeat his hot streak performance of 2019 which is not an easy undertaking. The probabilities are intimately related to Elo's choice K$$ K $$‐factor used for grandmaster chess play. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the policy issues involved with the choice of K$$ K $$‐factor.",
Quantum Bayes AI,"Nick Polson, Vadim Sokolov, Jianeng Xu",2022/8/17,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.08068,"Quantum Bayesian AI (Q-B) is an emerging field that levers the computational gains available in Quantum computing.

Our framework unifies MCMC, Deep Learning and Quantum Learning calculations from the viewpoint from von Neumann's principle of quantum measurement. Quantum embeddings and neural gates are also an important part of data encoding and feature selection. There is a natural duality with well-known kernel methods in statistical learning. We illustrate the behaviour of quantum algorithms on two simple classification algorithms. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

Of interest here are the rank data under the following settings:(i) covariate information available for the ranked entities;(ii) rankers of varying qualities or having different opinions; and (iii) incomplete ranking lists for nonoverlapping subgroups. We review some key ideas built around the Thurstone model family by researchers in the past few decades and provide a unifying approach for Bayesian Analysis of Rank data with Covariates (BARC) and its extensions in handling heterogeneous rankers. With this Bayesian framework, we can study rankers’ varying quality, cluster rankers’ heterogeneous opinions, and measure the corresponding uncertainties. To enable an efficient Bayesian inference, we advocate a parameter-expanded Gibbs sampler to sample from the target posterior distribution. The posterior samples also result in a Bayesian aggregated ranking list, with credible intervals quantifying its uncertainty. We investigate and compare performances of the proposed methods and other rank aggregation methods in both simulation studies and two real-data examples.",
Housing Market Forecasting using Home Showing Events,"Yuanyuan Zha, Susan T Parker, James J Foster, Vadim Sokolov",2022/1/6,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.04003,"Both buyers and sellers face uncertainty in real estate transactions in about when to time a transaction and at what cost. Both buyers and sellers make decisions without knowing the present and future state of the large and dynamic real estate market. Current approaches rely on analysis of historic transactions to price a property. However, as we show in this paper, the transaction data alone cannot be used to forecast demand. We develop a housing demand index based on microscopic home showings events data that can provide decision-making support for buyers and sellers on a very granular time and spatial scale. We use statistical modeling to develop a housing market demand forecast up to twenty weeks using high-volume, high-velocity data on home showings, listing events, and historic sales data. We demonstrate our analysis using data from seven million individual records sourced from a unique, proprietary dataset that has not previously been explored in application to the real estate market. We then employ a series of predictive models to estimate current and forecast future housing demand. A housing demand index provides insight into the level of demand for a home on the market and to what extent current demand represents future expectation. As a result, these indices provide decision-making support into important questions about when to sell or buy, or the elasticity present in the housing demand market, which impact price negotiations, price-taking and price-setting expectations. This forecast is especially valuable because it helps buyers and sellers to know on a granular and timely basis if they should engage in a home …",
Data Augmentation for Bayesian Deep Learning,"Yuexi Wang, Nicholas Polson, Vadim O Sokolov",2022/1,Journal Bayesian Analysis,"Deep Learning (DL) methods have emerged as one of the most powerful tools for functional approximation and prediction. While the representation properties of DL have been well studied, uncertainty quantification remains challenging and largely unexplored. Data augmentation techniques are a natural approach to provide uncertainty quantification and to incorporate stochastic Monte Carlo search into stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods. The purpose of our paper is to show that training DL architectures with data augmentation leads to efficiency gains. We use the theory of scale mixtures of normals to derive data augmentation strategies for deep learning. This allows variants of the expectation-maximization and MCMC algorithms to be brought to bear on these high dimensional nonlinear deep learning models.

Our solution is greatly inspired by the method of Lagrange multiplier and some recent adoptions of game theory to deep learning. After formally defining our proposed method based on them, we develop an adaptive gradient ascent method to stabilize its optimization process. In our experiments, the presented method solves all the large-scale benchmark KP instances in a minute whereas existing methods show fluctuating runtime. We also show that our method can be used for other applications, including but not limited to the point cloud resampling.",
Strategic Bayesian Asset Allocation,"Vadim Sokolov, Michael Polson",2019/5/21,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.08414,"Strategic asset allocation requires an investor to select stocks from a given basket of assets. The perspective of our investor is to maximize risk-adjusted alpha returns relative to a benchmark index. Historical returns are used to provide inputs into an optimization algorithm. Our approach uses Bayesian regularization to not only provide stock selection but also optimal sequential portfolio weights. By incorporating investor preferences with a number of different regularization penalties we extend the approaches of Black (1992) and Puelz (2015). We tailor standard sparse MCMC algorithms to calculate portfolio weights and perform selection. We illustrate our methodology on stock selection from the SP100 stock index and from the top fifty holdings of two hedge funds Renaissance Technologies and Viking Global.

A combination of tools is required to understand these linkages and how they may change in the future as a function of climate change and population growth.
