On end-to-end throughput of opportunistic routing in multirate and multihop wireless networks,"Kai Zeng, Wenjing Lou, Hongqiang Zhai",2008/4/13,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2008-The 27th Conference on Computer Communications,"Routing in multi-hop wireless networks presents a great challenge mainly due to unreliable wireless links and interference among concurrent transmissions. Recently, a new routing paradigm, opportunistic routing (OR), is proposed to cope with the unreliable transmissions by exploiting the broadcast nature and spatial diversity of the wireless medium. Previous studies on OR focused on networks with a single channel rate. The performance of OR in a multi-rate scenario is not carefully studied. In addition, although simulation and practical implementation have shown that OR achieves better throughput performance than that of traditional routing, there is no theoretical results on capacity enhancement provided by OR or network capacity bounds of OR.

On throughput efficiency of geographic opportunistic routing in multihop wireless networks,"Kai Zeng, Wenjing Lou, Jie Yang, D Richard Brown III",2007/8/14,"Book The Fourth International Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness & Workshops","Geographic opportunistic routing (GOR) is a new routing concept in multihop wireless networks.

GOR takes advantages of the spatial diversity and broadcast nature of wireless communications and is an efficient mechanism to combat the unreliable links. The existing GOR schemes typically involve as many as available next-hop neighbors into the local opportunistic forwarding, and give the nodes closer to the destination higher relay priorities.

A new approach for random key pre‐distribution in large‐scale wireless sensor networks,"Kui Ren, Kai Zeng, Wenjing Lou",2006/5,Journal wireless communications and mobile computing,"In a wireless sensor network (WSN), pre‐distribution of secret keys is possibly the most practical approach to protect network communications. To meet the stringent resource constraints of the sensor nodes, key pre‐distribution schemes should be highly efficient, require as little storage space as possible, and at the same time, maintain a strong security strength, that is, high resilience against node capture. In this paper, a new approach for random key pre‐distribution is proposed to achieve both efficiency and security goals. The novelty of this approach lies in that, instead of using a key pool consisting of random keys, a key generation technique is carefully designed such that a large number of random keys can be represented by a small number of key‐generation keys.

Trusted collaborative spectrum sensing for mobile cognitive radio networks,"Shraboni Jana, Kai Zeng, Wei Cheng, Prasant Mohapatra",2013/7/15,Journal IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,"Collaborative spectrum sensing is a key technology in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Although mobility is an inherent property of wireless networks, there has been no prior work studying the performance of collaborative spectrum sensing under attacks in mobile CRNs. Existing solutions based on user trust for secure collaborative spectrum sensing cannot be applied to mobile scenarios, since they do not consider the location diversity of the network, thus over penalize honest users who are at bad locations with severe path-loss. In this paper, we propose to use two trust parameters, location reliability and malicious intention (LRMI), to improve both malicious user detection and primary user detection in mobile CRNs under attack. Location reliability reflects path-loss characteristics of the wireless channel and malicious intention captures the true intention of secondary users, respectively. We propose a primary …",80
Metrics for evaluating video streaming quality in lossy IEEE 802.11 wireless networks,"An Chan, Kai Zeng, Prasant Mohapatra, Sung-Ju Lee, Sujata Banerjee",2010/3/14,Conference 2010 Proceedings Ieee Infocom,"Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is the simplest and the most widely used video quality evaluation methodology.

Such inaccuracy in PSNR calculations adversely affects the development of video communications in wireless networks. This paper proposes a novel video quality evaluation methodology. As it not only considers the PSNR of a video, but also with modifications to handle the packet loss issue, we name this evaluation method MPSNR.

Adaptive wireless channel probing for shared key generation based on PID controller,"Yunchuan Wei, Kai Zeng, Prasant Mohapatra",2012/6/26,Journal IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,"Generating a shared key between two parties from the wireless channel is an increasingly interesting topic. The process of obtaining information from the wireless channel is called channel probing. Previous key generation schemes probe the channel at a preset and constant rate without any consideration of channel variation or probing efficiency. To satisfy the usersâ requirements for key generation rate (KGR) and to use the wireless channel efficiently, we propose an adaptive channel probing scheme based on the proportional-integral-derivative controller, which is used to tune the probing rate. Moreover, we use the Lempel-Ziv complexity to estimate the entropy rate of channel statistics (received signal strength), which is considered as an indicator of probing efficiency.

Good neighbor: Ad hoc pairing of nearby wireless devices by multiple antennas.,"Liang Cai, Kai Zeng, Hao Chen, Prasant Mohapatra",2011/2/6,Conference NDSS,"The proliferation of personal wireless devices requires secure connection between them. While it is easy to securely pair electronic devices by wires, it is very challenging to pair them wirelessly when they have no prior association. We propose Good Neighbor, a novel scheme that securely pairs nearby wireless devices by exploiting multiple antennas built in them. Our scheme requires neither shared secrets nor out-of-band channels (eg, audio, visual, keyboard, etc.) between the pairing devices. It only requires that the receiver has multiple antennas and that the sender can be placed nearby the receiver. Our scheme is based on the propagation characteristic of the wireless signal that the power of the received signal is inversely proportional to some exponent of the distance between the sender and receiver. When a nearby sender moves very close to one antenna on the receiver, the receiver can observe a large difference between the signal strength measured on its two antennas, whereas a faraway sender would be unable to induce such a large difference. We validate our scheme through theoretical analysis and experimental measurements. We discuss the factors that may affect our scheme—including antenna gain, received signal strength (RSS) saturation, dynamic rate adaptation, and multipath effects—and how to mitigate them. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our scheme by implementing and evaluating a prototype.",75
Routing optimization security in mobile IPv6,"Kui Ren, Wenjing Lou, Kai Zeng, Feng Bao, Jianying Zhou, Robert H Deng",2006/9/15,Journal Computer Networks,"Route Optimization (RO) in Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) provides a mobile node (MN) the opportunity to eliminate the inefficient triangle routing with its corresponding node (CN) and therefore, greatly improves the network performance.

Hardware module-based message authentication in intra-vehicle networks,"Eric Wang, William Xu, Suhas Sastry, Songsong Liu, Kai Zeng",2017/4/18,Book Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems,"The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a widely used industry-standard intra-vehicle broadcast network that connects the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) which control most car systems. The CAN contains substantial vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain control of the vehicle, due to its lack of security measures. To prevent an attacker from sending malicious messages through the CAN bus to take over a vehicle, we propose the addition of a secure hardware-based module, or Security ECU (SECU), onto the CAN bus. The SECU can perform key distribution and message verification, as well as corrupting malicious messages before they are fully received by an ECU. Only software modification is needed for existing ECUs, without changing the CAN protocol. This provides backward compatibility with existing CAN systems.

Multi-rate geographic opportunistic routing in wireless ad hoc networks,"Kai Zeng, Wenjing Lou, Yanchao Zhang",2007/10/29,Conference MILCOM 2007-IEEE Military Communications Conference,"Routing in wireless ad hoc networks is challenging mainly due to unreliable wireless links/channels.

Most existing multipath routing protocols are based on AODV or DSR and compute multiple paths with a single route discovery process via a network-wide flooding, which takes a substantial amount of network bandwidth. When node's geographic information is available, routing discovery flooding can be substituted by unicasts and then the routing overhead can be reduced.

We formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with weighted virtual reward. We propose a dynamic sniffer-channel assignment policy to capture as much as interested user data. Simulation results show that the proposed policy can achieve a logarithmic regret with relative scalability.",6

Sharing secrets via wireless broadcasting: A new efficient physical layer group secret key generation for multiple IoT devices,"Jie Tang, Hong Wen, Huan-Huan Song, Long Jiao, Kai Zeng",2022/1/31,Journal IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"With the increasing demands for sharing confidential information among massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices in 5G and beyond wireless networks, many applications require the common secret key generation for a group of IoT devices.

At the same time, a primary user emulation (PUE) attacker can send falsified primary user signals and prevent the secondary user from utilizing the available channel. The best attacking strategies that an attacker can apply have not been well studied. In this paper, for the first time, we study optimal PUE attack strategies by formulating an online learning problem where the attacker needs to dynamically decide the attacking channel in each time slot based on its attacking experience. The challenge in our problem is that since the PUE attack happens in the spectrum sensing phase, the attacker cannot observe the reward on the attacked channel. To address this challenge, we utilize the attacker’s observation capability. We propose online learning-based attacking strategies based on the attacker’s observation capabilities. Through our analysis, we show that with no observation within the attacking slot, the attacker loses on the regret order, and with the observation of at least one channel, there is a significant improvement on the attacking performance. Observation of multiple channels does not give additional benefit to the attacker (only a constant scaling) though it gives insight on the number of observations required to achieve the minimum constant factor.

Good Neighbor: Ad-Hoc Authentication of Nearby Wireless Devices by Multiple Antenna Diversity,"Liang Cai, Kai Zeng, Hao Chen, Prasant Mohapatra",2011,Conference NDSS Symposium,"As wireless devices proliferate, in many situations we wish to authenticate devices by mere proximity. This is the common authentication mechanism for wired devices where we plug them into each other. In this paper we propose a scheme for authenticating nearby wireless devices that share no prior secrets. The scheme takes advantage of multiple antennae built in many modern wireless devices. The scheme is based on the characteristic of wireless channels that the power of the received signal is inverse proportional to some exponent of the distance between the sender and receiver. When a nearby sender is very close to one antenna on the receiver, the receiver can observe a large difference between the power measured on its two antennae, whereas a faraway sender would be unable to induce this large difference. We validate our scheme through theoretical analysis and experimental measurements. We discuss other factors that may affect our scheme, including antenna gain, RSS saturation, dynamic rate adaptation, and multipath effects. Since multipath effects can seriously undermine our scheme, we propose to use multichannel measurements to mitigate it. Finally, we evaluate our scheme by authenticating a mobile phone to a laptop using threshold values derived from our measurement and observed satisfactory results.",1
Federated Graph Neural Network for Fast Anomaly Detection in Controller Area Networks,"Hengrun Zhang, Kai Zeng, Shuai Lin",2023/1/27,Journal IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,"Due to the lack of CAN frame encryption and authentication, CAN bus is vulnerable to various attacks, which can in general be divided into message injection, suspension, and falsification. Existing CAN bus anomaly detection mechanisms either can only detect one or two of these attacks, or require numerous CAN messages during predictions, which can hardly realize real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a CAN bus anomaly detection system that can detect all these attacks simultaneously in as short as 3 milliseconds (ms) based on Graph Neural Network (GNN). This work generates directed attributed graphs based on CAN message streams in given message intervals. Node attributes denote data contents in CAN messages while each edge attribute represents the frequency of a typical CAN ID pair in the given interval. Afterwards, a GNN is trained based on generated CAN message graphs …",
Secure and Energy-Efficient Proximity-Based Pairing for IoT Devices,"Yaqi He, Kai Zeng, Brian L Mark, Khaled N Khasawneh",2022/12/4,Conference 2022 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps),"Internet of Things (IoT) devices are largely resource-constrained embedded devices with limited user interface and battery capacity. As a consequence, bootstrapping a secure connection between an IoT device and a wireless network (e.g., WiFi network) becomes a challenging problem since the traditional Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based authentication cannot be directly applied. Proximity-based device authentication is a promising mechanism to enable secure pairing of an IoT device to a wireless network. However, existing solutions do not deliberately consider energy-efficiency nor the tradeoff between energy consumption and security strength in the pairing process. This paper fills this gap by enhancing the energy-efficiency and studying the tradeoff between energy consumption and security strength of an existing proximity-based IoT device authentication protocol, called Move2Auth. An optimization problem is …",
Security Analysis of Triangle Channel-based Physical Layer Key Generation in Wireless Backscatter Communications,"Jiajun Li, Pu Wang, Long Jiao, Zheng Yan, Kai Zeng, Yishan Yang",2022/11/24,Journal IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,"Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ultra-low-power communications by backscattering ambient radio frequency (RF) signals and harvesting energy simultaneously. It has emerged as a cutting-edge technology for supporting a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, existing research lacks effective secret key sharing schemes for safeguarding communications between resource-constrained backscatter devices (BDs) in AmBC systems. In this paper, we present, Tri-Channel, a novel physical layer key generation scheme between two BDs by multiplying downlink signals and backscatter signals to obtain the information of a triangle channel as a shared random secret source for key generation. In particular, we analyze the security of our scheme under both passive and active attacks, concretely Eavesdropping Attack (EA), Control Channel Attack (CCA), Signal Manipulative Attack …",
Securing Wireless Channels: Reliable Shared Secret Extraction through OTFS,"Usama Saeed, Lingjia Liu, Kai Zeng, Robert Calderbank",2022/10/3,Conference 2022 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),"Physical layer key generation (PLKG) has emerged as a promising strategy for securing wireless communication using shared channel knowledge between two legitimate users. Traditional PLKG systems rely on time-frequency domain channels using metrics such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) or Channel State Information (CSI) to generate secure keys. As a result of the rapid variation in the time-frequency domain channels, these systems are prone to error and suffer from a high reconciliation overhead requirement. Conversely, the same channels have a sparse and static representation in the delay-Doppler domain, which is utilized by the recently introduced Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation scheme. Furthermore, the channel representation in the delay-Doppler domain is uniquely determined by the scattering environment between the transmitter-receiver pair. In this paper …",
Friendly spectrum jamming against MIMO eavesdropping,"Rong Jin, Kai Zeng, Chuan Jiang",2022/8,Journal Wireless Networks,"Friendly spectrum jamming is a flexible scheme to establish secure communications among heterogeneous wireless devices without the need of encryption. Previous works have indicated that this scheme however has weak security strength against multiple antenna eavesdropper in today’s wireless communication systems, which limits its wide applicability. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel modulation method, called energy modulation. The basic idea of our method is to keep the secrecy of the channel state information in modulation, so as to bring high uncertainty to the MIMO’s separation and the eavesdropper’s decoding. As a result, the security strength of friendly jamming notably increases facing multiple antenna eavesdropper. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform independent component analysis to decouple the components of the measured signals with maximum …",
AuthIoT: A Transferable Wireless Authentication Scheme for IoT Devices Without Input Interface,"Shichen Zhang, Pedram Kheirkhah Sangdeh, Hossein Pirayesh, Huacheng Zeng, Qiben Yan, Kai Zeng",2022/6/27,Journal IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"Wireless Internet of Things (IoT) applications have penetrated every aspect of our society and become increasingly important in smart homes, smart cities, and smart hospitals. However, many WiFi-based IoT devices (e.g., light switches, door/window open alert sensors, and Google Home) do not have input interfaces such as keypad or touchscreen due to their limits in physical size, power consumption, and/or manufacturing cost, making it inconvenient and onerous for end users to authenticate those IoT devices for wireless Internet access. In this article, we present AuthIoT, a learning-based authentication scheme for wireless IoT devices without input interfaces. The key component of AuthIoT is a channel state information (CSI)-based character classification algorithm for a WiFi access point (AP), which recognizes the passcode from an IoT device when an end user holds it in hand and writes the passcode over the …",
Beam Pattern Fingerprinting with Missing Features for Spoofing Attack Detection in Millimeter-Wave Networks,"Ya Jiang, Long Jiao, Liang Zhao, Kai Zeng",2022/5/19,Book Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Workshop on Wireless Security and Machine Learning,"As one of the key enabling technologies of 5G wireless communication, millimeter-Wave (mmWave) technology unlocks the ultra-wide bandwidth opportunity in supporting high-throughput (e.g., multi-Gbps) and ultra-low latency applications at much lower cost-per-bit. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless medium, like sub-6GHz communication, mmWave communication is still subject to various attacks, such as the identity spoofing attacks. Recently, beam pattern fingerprinting using the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) traces obtained during the beam sweeping process has been proposed to detect spoofing attacks in mmWave networks. However, a complete beam sweeping that tests all the tx-rx beam pairs is not always applied in practice. That is, to save link initialization or maintenance overhead, the implementation of efficient beam management schemes usually only probes a subset of tx-rx beam pairs …",
Characterization of AES Implementations on Microprocessor-based IoT Devices,"Sunanda Roy, Angelos Stavrou, Brian L Mark, Kai Zeng, Sai Manoj PD, Khaled N Khasawneh",2022/4/10,Conference 2022 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC),"The increased proliferation of IoT devices and the emergence of 5G networks have necessitated increased security of data storage and communication in such connected devices. Thus, cryptography is used in IoT environments to provide secrecy and integrity to the data as well as both authentication and anonymity to the communications across the IoT network. However, IoT devices are resource-constrained devices; have limited memory, network bandwidth, power, and compute units. Since most of the existing cryptographic algorithms were designed to run on resource powerful devices (e.g., desktops or servers), many of these algorithms may not fit into resource-constrained devices.

Physical layer key generation against MIMO eavesdropper by exploiting full-duplex technology,"Rong Jin, Kai Zeng",2021/8/19,"Description Generating a shared secret key from physical layer is an interesting topic with practical value. Inspired by the encouraging progress on full-duplex radio, a novel mechanism aiming at high and steady key generation rate with low cost is proposed in this paper. Legitimate users simultaneously send random bit sequences to actively interfere with each other. They extract those mutually jammed bits to form a secret key. A special digital modulation scheme, called Random Manchester coding is proposed. The proposed scheme achieves three goals. The first and the most important one is to prevent a MIMO eavesdropper from separating the superposed signal; the second one is to detect denial of service and key compromise attack to defend against an active attacker; the third one is to achieve design goal on low power radiation, computational complexity and memory cost.

Physical-layer security for mmWave massive MIMO communications in 5G networks,"Ning Wang, Long Jiao, Jie Tang, Kai Zeng",2020/10/12,"Journal Frontiers in Hardware Security and Trust: Theory, design and practice","Wireless communications play an important role in meeting the continuously increasing demands for transmission of important/private information, spanning credit card information, e-health data, control messages, etc. However, on the other hand, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium, wireless networks are subject to physical-layer threats such as eavesdropping, spoofing, and jamming attacks. In the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication networks, information security is a critical issue [1]. Basically, security strategies today rely on cryptographic techniques and associated protocols. Nevertheless, these solutions have drawbacks, for example, standardized protections within public wireless networks are not secure enough, and many of their weaknesses are well known; even if enhanced protocols exist, they incur strong constraints and high additional costs for the users of public networks [2]. Therefore, physical-layer security (PLS), a new security method, which safeguards wireless communications based on the information theoretic approach has received significant research interest recently, especially in the 5G communication techniques. In the list of the wireless 5G enablers, massive multiple-input–multiple-output (massive MIMO) and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are two dominant technologies [3]. With a large number of antennas, the ability of massive MIMO to create extremely narrow beams for many users is gaining the attention of industry and academia.

Federated Continuous Learning With Broad Network Architecture,"XinyuLei JunqingLe, Nankun Mu, Hengrun Zhang, Kai Zeng, Xiaofeng Liao","Federated learning (FL) is a machine-learning set-ting, where multiple clients collaboratively train a model under the coordination of a central server. The clients’ raw data are locally stored, and each client only uploads the trained weight to the server, which can mitigate the privacy risks from the centralized machine learning. However, most of the existing FL models focus on one-time learning without consideration for continuous learning. Continuous learning supports learning from streaming data continuously, so it can adapt to environmental changes and provide better real-time performance. In this article, we present a federated continuous learning scheme based on broad learning (FCL-BL) to support efficient and accurate federated continuous learning (FCL). In FCL-BL, we propose a weighted processing strategy to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem, so FCL-BL can handle continuous learning. Then, we develop a local-independent training solution to support fast and accurate training in FCL-BL. The proposed solution enables us to avoid using a time-consuming synchronous approach while addressing the inaccurate-training issue rooted in the previous asynchronous approach. Moreover, we introduce a batch-asynchronous approach and broad learning (BL) technique to guarantee the high efficiency of FCL-BL. Specifically, the batch-asynchronous approach reduces the number of client–server interaction rounds, and the BL technique supports incremental learning without retraining when learning newly produced data.
