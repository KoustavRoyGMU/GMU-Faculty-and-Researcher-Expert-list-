Identifying Seekers and Suppliers in Social Media Communities to Support Crisis Coordination,"Hemant Purohit, Andrew Hampton, Shreyansh Bhatt, V Shalin, Amit Sheth, John Flach",2014,Journal Journal of CSCW,"Effective crisis management has long relied on both the formal and informal response communities. Social media platforms such as Twitter increase the participation of the informal response community in crisis response. Yet, challenges remain in realizing the formal and informal response communities as a cooperative work system. We demonstrate a supportive technology that recognizes the existing capabilities of the informal response community to identify needs (seeker behavior) and provide resources (supplier behavior), using their own terminology. To facilitate awareness and the articulation of work in the formal response community, we present a technology that can bridge the differences in terminology and understanding of the task between the formal and informal response communities.

Intent Classification of Short-Text on Social Media,"Hemant Purohit, Guozhu Dong, Valerie Shalin, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, Amit Sheth",2015/12,Conference 2015 IEEE International Conference on Smart City/SocialCom/SustainCom (SmartCity),"Social media platforms facilitate the emergence of citizen communities that discuss real-world events. Their content reflects a variety of intent ranging from social good (e.g., volunteering to help) to commercial interest (e.g., criticizing product features). Hence, mining intent from social data can aid in filtering social media to support organizations, such as an emergency management unit for resource planning. However, effective intent mining is inherently challenging due to ambiguity in interpretation, and sparsity of relevant behaviors in social data. In this paper, we address the problem of multiclass classification of intent with a use-case of social data generated during crisis events.

Understanding User-Community Engagement by Multi-faceted Features: A Case Study on Twitter,"Hemant Purohit, Yiye Ruan, Amruta Joshi, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Amit Sheth",2011,"Conference Social Media Engagement Workshop, WWW-2011","The widespread use of social networking websites in recent years has suggested a need for effective methods to understand the new forms of user engagement, the factors impacting them, and the fundamental reasons for such engagements. We perform exploratory analysis on Twitter1 to understand the dynamics of user engagement by studying what attracts a user to participate in discussions on a topic. We identify various factors which might affect user engagement, ranging from content properties, network topology to user characteristics on the social network, and use them to predict user joining behavior. As opposed to traditional ways of studying them separately, these factors are organized in our framework, People-Content-Network Analysis (PCNA), mainly designed to enable understanding of human social dynamics on the web. We perform experiments on various Twitter user communities formed around topics from diverse domains, with varied social significance, duration and spread. Our findings suggest that capabilities of content, user and network features vary greatly, motivating the incorporation of all the factors in user engagement analysis, and hence, a strong need can be felt to study dynamics of user engagement by using the PCNA framework. Our study also reveals certain correlation between types of event for discussion topics and impact of user engagement factors.",37
Social-eoc: Serviceability model to rank social media requests for emergency operation centers,"Hemant Purohit, Carlos Castillo, Muhammad Imran, Rahul Pandey",2018/8/28,Conference 2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM),"The public expects a prompt response from emergency services to address requests for help posted on social media. However, the information overload of social media experienced by these organizations, coupled with their limited human resources, challenges them to timely identify and prioritize critical requests. This is particularly acute in crisis situations where any delay may have a severe impact on the effectiveness of the response. While social media has been extensively studied during crises, there is limited work on formally characterizing serviceable help requests and automatically prioritizing them for a timely response. In this paper, we present a formal model of serviceability called Social-EOC (Social Emergency Operations Center), which describes the elements of a serviceable message posted in social media that can be expressed as a request.

On Understanding Divergence of Online Social Group Discussion,"Hemant Purohit, Yiye Ruan, Dave Fuhry, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Amit Sheth",2014,Conference ICWSM,"We study online social group dynamics based on how group members diverge in their online discussions. Previous studies mostly focused on the link structure to characterize social group dynamics, whereas the group behavior of content generation in discussions is not well understood. Particularly, we use Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence to measure the divergence of topics in user-generated contents, and how it progresses over time. We study Twitter messages (tweets) in multiple real-world events (natural disasters and social activism) with different times and demographics. We also model structural and user features with guidance from two socio-psychological theories, social cohesion and social identity, to learn their implications on group discussion divergence. Those features show significant correlation with group discussion divergence. By leveraging them we are able to construct a classifier to predict the future increase or decrease in group discussion divergence, which achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 and an F-1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 0.8. Our approach allows to systematically study collective diverging group behavior independent of group formation design. It can help to prioritize whom to engage with in communities for specific topics of needs during disaster response coordination, and for specific concerns and advocacy in the brand management.",24
Assisting coordination during crisis: a domain ontology based approach to infer resource needs from tweets,"Shreyansh P Bhatt, Hemant Purohit, Andrew Hampton, Valerie Shalin, Amit Sheth, John Flach",2014/6/23,Conference Proceedings of the 2014 ACM conference on Web science,"Ubiquitous social media during crises provides citizen reports on the situation, needs and supplies. Previous research extracts resource needs directly from the text (e.g. ""Power cut to Coney Island and Brighton beach"" indicates a power need). This approach assumes that citizens derive and write about specific needs from their observations, properly specified for the emergency response system, an assumption that is not consistent with general conversational behavior. In our study, Twitter messages (tweets) from Hurricane Sandy in 2012 clearly indicate power blackouts, but not their probable implications (e.g. loss of power to hospital life support systems). We use a domain model to capture such interdependencies between resources and needs. We represent these dependencies in an ontology that specifies the functional association between resources.

Design of mitigation and intervention strategies for fake information has received less attention in social media research, mainly due to the challenge of designing relevant user behavior models. In this paper we lay the groundwork towards such models and present a novel, data-driven approach for user behavior analysis and characterization. We leverage unsupervised learning to define user behavioral categories over key behavior dimensions. We then relate these categories to content-based, user-based, and network-based features that can be extracted in near-real time and identify the most discriminative features.

Prediction of Topic Volume on Twitter,"Yiye Ruan, Hemant Purohit, Dave Fuhry, Srinivasan Parthasarthy, Amit Sheth",2012,Conference 4th Int'l ACM Conference of Web Science (WebSci),"We discuss an approach for predicting microscopic (individual) and macroscopic (collective) user behavioral patterns with respect to specific trending topics on Twitter. Going beyond previous efforts that have analyzed driving factors in whether and when a user will publish topic-relevant tweets, here we seek to predict the strength of content generation which allows more accurate understanding of Twitter users' behavior and more effective utilization of the online social network for diffusing information. Unlike traditional approaches, we consider multiple dimensions into one regression-based prediction framework covering network structure, user interaction, content characteristics and past activity. Experimental results on three large Twitter datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We find in particular that combining features from multiple aspects (especially past activity information and network features) yields the best performance. Furthermore, we observe that leveraging more past information leads to better prediction performance, although the marginal benefit is diminishing.",21
Multilingual Code-Switching for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Intent Prediction and Slot Filling,"Jitin Krishnan, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Hemant Purohit, Huzefa Rangwala",2021/3/13,"Conference Multilingual Representation Learning Workshop, EMNLP-2021","Predicting user intent and detecting the corresponding slots from text are two key problems in Natural Language Understanding (NLU). In the context of zero-shot learning, this task is typically approached by either using representations from pre-trained multilingual transformers such as mBERT, or by machine translating the source data into the known target language and then fine-tuning. Our work focuses on a particular scenario where the target language is unknown during training. To this goal, we propose a novel method to augment the monolingual source data using multilingual code-switching via random translations to enhance a transformer's language neutrality when fine-tuning it for a downstream task. This method also helps discover novel insights on how code-switching with different language families around the world impact the performance on the target language. Experiments on the benchmark dataset of MultiATIS++ yielded an average improvement of +4.2% in accuracy for intent task and +1.8% in F1 for slot task using our method over the state-of-the-art across 8 different languages.

Classifying user types on social media to inform who-what-where coordination during crisis response,"Hemant Purohit, Jennifer Lisa Chan",2017/1/1,Journal Proceedings of the International ISCRAM Conference,"Timely information is essential for better dynamic situational awareness, which leads to efficient resource planning, coordination, and action. However, given the scale and outreach of social media—a key information sharing platform during crises, diverse types of users participate in discussions during crises, which affect the vetting of information for dynamic situational awareness and response coordination activities. In this paper, we present a user analysis on Twitter during crises for three major user types—Organization, Organizationaffiliated (a person’s self-identifying affiliation with an organization in his/her profile), and Non-affiliated (person not identifying any affiliation), by first classifying users and then presenting their communication patterns during two recent crises. Our analysis shows distinctive patterns of the three user types for participation and communication on social media during crises.

When Official Systems Overload: A Framework for Finding Social Media Calls for Help during Evacuations.,"Steve Peterson, Keri K Stephens, Hemant Purohit, Amanda Lee Hughes",2019,Conference ISCRAM,"During large-scale disasters it is not uncommon for Public Safety Answering Points (eg, 9-1-1) to encounter service disruptions or become overloaded due to call volume. As observed in the two past United States hurricane seasons, citizens are increasingly turning to social media whether as a consequence of their inability to reach 9-1-1, or as a preferential means of communications. Relying on past research that has examined social media use in disasters, combined with the practical knowledge of the first-hand disaster response experiences, this paper develops a knowledge-driven framework containing parameters useful in identifying patterns of shared information on social media when citizens need help. This effort explores the feasibility of determining differences, similarities, common themes, and time-specific discoveries of social media calls for help associated with hurricane evacuations. At a future date, validation of this framework will be demonstrated using datasets from multiple disasters.

We use data from a hashtag activism campaign,# ILookLikeAnEngineer, launched to showcase diversity within engineering workforce, to examine how different elements of a campaign blend together. We specifically identify three distinct but interconnected ways in which social media supports activism: 1) modality—it allows users to participate through text, photos, and links; 2) messaging—it allows users to post and support multiple though related topics; and 3) actors—it provides a voice to different participants (individuals/organizations, men/women). Our analysis supports the idea that multivocality—the core idea that people leverage multiple ways of participating—is the key to campaign success. Our analysis of 19,492 original tweets and 89,650 retweets shows that multivocality allowed the campaign to receive support not just from individuals but from large corporations, media, and NGOs, who were able to share their perspective using their preferred modality giving rise to a new form of digital polyphonic narrative that supports their agenda.",9
Enhancing Cohesion and Coherence of Fake Text to Improve Believability for Deceiving Cyber Attackers,"Prakruthi Karuna, Hemant Purohit, Ozlem Uzuner, Sushil Jajodia, Rajesh Ganesan",2018,Journal Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Language Cognition and Computational Models,"Ever increasing ransomware attacks and thefts of intellectual property demand cybersecurity solutions to protect critical documents. One emerging solution is to place fake text documents in the repository of critical documents for deceiving and catching cyber attackers. We can generate fake text documents by obscuring the salient information in legit text documents. However, the obscuring process can result in linguistic inconsistencies, such as broken co-references and illogical flow of ideas across the sentences, which can discern the fake document and render it unbelievable. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate believable fake text documents by automatically improving the linguistic consistency of computer-generated fake text. Our method focuses on enhancing syntactic cohesion and semantic coherence across discourse segments. We conduct experiments with human subjects to evaluate the effect of believability improvements in distinguishing legit texts from fake texts. Results show that the probability to distinguish legit texts from believable fake texts is consistently lower than from fake texts that have not been improved in believability. This indicates the effectiveness of our method in generating believable fake text.",9
An information filtering and management model for twitter traffic to assist crises response coordination,"Hemant Purohit, Andrew Hampton, Shreyansh Bhatt, Valerie L Shalin, Amit Sheth, John Flach",2013,Journal Special Issue on Crisis Informatics and Collaboration,"Disasters such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012 result in extensive social media traffic, using networking platforms such as Twitter, as citizens report on their situations, identify needs and attempt to distribute resources. We address the challenge of finding relevant, actionable tweets from this large volume with an information filtering model. Driven primarily by concern for coordination, the initial domain independent analysis incorporates psycholinguistic theory to filter for potential messages of cooperation. The subsequent domain dependent analysis leverages a lightweight, language-driven, disaster-related domain model to extract resource references (eg, food, shelter, etc.) in its first phase. Using a lexicon of verbs concerning the transfer of property, combined with simple syntactic frames, a second phase of domain dependent analysis assists in the identification of a particular kind of tacit cooperation, in the declarations of resource needs and availability. The results populate an annotated information repository to support the presentation of organized, actionable information nuggets regarding resource needs and availability at varying levels of abstraction. Computationally grounding the abstractions in raw data enables complex querying ability for who-what-where in coordination. Initial evaluation of the annotations relative to human judgment shows fair to good agreement. In addition to the potential benefits to the formal emergency response community of a filtered and organized corpus, the results serve as a benchmark for evaluating more computationally intensive efforts and characterizing the patterns of language behavior for coordination during …",9

This pattern has overwhelmed the emergency services with limited resources and demands the optimization of response processes. It is partly due to traditional `reactive' approach of emergency services to collect data about incidents, where a source initiates a call to the emergency number (e.g., 911 in U.S.), delaying and limiting the potentially optimal response. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Waze provides an opportunity to develop a rapid, `proactive' approach to collect data about incidents through crowd-generated observational reports.

The classification accuracies of these algorithms largely depend upon the size of labeled samples that are provided during the learning phase. Other factors such as class distribution, term distribution among the training set also play an important role on classifier's accuracy. However, due to several reasons (money / time constraints, limited number of skilled labelers etc.), a large sample of labeled messages is often not available immediately for learning an efficient classification model. Consequently, classifier trained on a poor model often mis-classifies data and hence, the applicability of such learning techniques (especially for the online setting) during ongoing crisis response remains limited.

For instance, a recent paper argued that several constructs serve as essential indicators of the quality of between-team activities including coordination, boundary spanning, and adaptation (Lazzara, Keebler, Shuffler, Patzer, Smith, & Misasi, 2015). This is a valuable theoretical insight, but the key to unlocking the full potential for real-world application in training and simulation is dependent on our ability to find proxies to measure those phenomena. Sensors that record proximity, position (GPS), and speech pattern data have been used as proxies for coordination, communication, and other team processes, including task management, situational awareness, and decision-making (Feese, Burscher, Jonas, & Tröster, 2014; Rosen, Dietz, Yang, Priebe, & Pronovost, 2014). Generally, data are gathered throughout an entire simulation, without a focus on which team inflection points and performance episodes are most important to capture. Moreover, emergency response scenarios are often handled by a complex system of teams varying in their betweenteam interdependencies.

Diversity-Based Generalization for Neural Unsupervised Text Classification under Domain Shift,"Jitin Krishnan, Hemant Purohit, Huzefa Rangwala",2020,Conference ECML-PKDD,"Domain adaptation approaches seek to learn from a source domain and generalize it to an unseen target domain. At present, the state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for subjective text classification problems leverage unlabeled target data along with labeled source data. In this paper, we propose a novel method for domain adaptation of single-task text classification problems based on a simple but effective idea of diversity-based generalization that does not require unlabeled target data but still matches the state-of-the-art in performance. Diversity plays the role of promoting the model to better generalize and be indiscriminate towards domain shift by forcing the model not to rely on same features for prediction. We apply this concept on the most explainable component of neural networks, the attention layer. To generate sufficient diversity, we create a multi-head attention model and infuse a diversity constraint between the attention heads such that each head will learn differently. We further expand upon our model by tri-training and designing a procedure with an additional diversity constraint between the attention heads of the tri-trained classifiers. Extensive evaluation using the standard benchmark dataset of Amazon reviews and a newly constructed dataset of Crisis events shows that our fully unsupervised method matches with the competing baselines that uses unlabeled target data. Our results demonstrate that machine learning architectures that ensure sufficient diversity can generalize better; encouraging future research to design ubiquitously usable learning models without using unlabeled target data.",6
AI for Trustworthiness! Credible User Identification on Social Web for Disaster Response Agencies,"Rahul Pandey, Hemant Purohit, Jennifer Chan, Aditya Johri",2018/10/1,Conference AAAI Fall Symposium Series,"Although social media provides a vibrant platform to discuss real-world events, the quantity of information generated can overwhelm decision making based on that information. By better understanding who is participating in information sharing, we can more effectively filter information as the event unfolds. Fine-grained understanding of credible sources can even help develop a trusted network of users for specific events or situations. Given the culture of relying on trusted actors for work practices in the humanitarian and disaster response domain, we propose to identify potential credible users as organizational and organizational-affiliated user accounts on social media in realtime for effective information collection and dissemination. Therefore, we examine social media using AI and Machine Learning methods during three types of humanitarian or disaster events and identify key actors responding to social media conversations as organization (business, group, or institution), organization-affiliated (individual with an organizational affiliation), and non-affiliated (individual without organizational affiliation) identities. We propose a credible user classification approach using a diverse set of social, activity, and descriptive representation features extracted from user profile metadata. Our extensive experiments showed a contrasting participation behavior of the user identities by their content practices, such as the use of higher authoritative content sharing by organization and organization-affiliated users.

In spite of decades of investments, efforts have not yielded desired returns - participation by minorities continues to lag at a time when STEM workforce requirements are increasing. In recent years a new stream of data has emerged - online social networks, including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram - that act as a key sensor of social behavior and attitudes of the public. Almost 87% of the American population now participates in some form of social media activity. Consequently, social networking sites have become powerful indicators of social action and social media data has shown significant promise for studying many issues including public health communication, political campaign, humanitarian crisis, and, activism. We argue that social media data can likewise be leveraged to better understand and improve engineering diversity. As a case study to illustrate the viability of the approach, we present findings from a campaign, #ILookLikeAnEngineer (using Twitter data - 19,354 original tweets and 29,529 retweets), aimed at increasing gender diversity in the engineering workplace.

In this study, we examine social data consisting of microblogs collected from Twitter to analyze public opinion regarding GBV, analyzing tweeting practices by pragmatic function (assertion, belief, etc.). We suggest that the ability to mine actionable insight depends on pragmatic function, where belief tweets specifically reveal attitudes (for example regarding sex trafficking or family condoned practices of arranged temporary marriage) that can serve as the target of intervention campaigns. Using a data driven approach that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we first develop a classifier that distinguishes pragmatic function classes using unigrams. In subsequent processing, we mine topics within each class to demonstrate the presence of content pertinent to intervention within the belief class.

On the Role of Social Identity and Cohesion in Characterizing Online Social Communities,"Hemant Purohit, Yiye Ruan, David Fuhry, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Amit Sheth",2012/12/1,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0141,"Two prevailing theories for explaining social group or community structure are cohesion and identity. The social cohesion approach posits that social groups arise out of an aggregation of individuals that have mutual interpersonal attraction as they share common characteristics. These characteristics can range from common interests to kinship ties and from social values to ethnic backgrounds. In contrast, the social identity approach posits that an individual is likely to join a group based on an intrinsic self-evaluation at a cognitive or perceptual level. In other words group members typically share an awareness of a common category membership. In this work we seek to understand the role of these two contrasting theories in explaining the behavior and stability of social communities in Twitter. A specific focal point of our work is to understand the role of these theories in disparate contexts ranging from disaster response to socio-political activism. We extract social identity and social cohesion features-of-interest for large scale datasets of five real-world events and examine the effectiveness of such features in capturing behavioral characteristics and the stability of groups. We also propose a novel measure of social group sustainability based on the divergence in group discussion. Our main findings are: 1) Sharing of social identities (especially physical location) among group members has a positive impact on group sustainability, 2) Structural cohesion (represented by high group density and low average shortest path length) is a strong indicator of group sustainability, and 3) Event characteristics play a role in shaping group sustainability, as social …",4

Mining risk behaviors from social media for pandemic crisis preparedness and response,"Yasas Senarath, Steve Peterson, Hemant Purohit, Amanda L Hughes, Keri K Stephens",2021,"Journal International conference on social computing, behavioral-cultural modeling, & prediction and behavior representation in modeling and simulation","The significance of social media in crisis management is wellknown, as evident from the vast literature generated in the last decade. Prior research has studied public behavior for various contexts ranging from evacuation planning to supporting response operations and providing emotional support for recovery. However, the majority of these research studies have focused on natural hazard events and there is less exploration for pandemic crises. In this paper, we present a novel social media mining approach for detecting risk behaviors at scale to support crisis preparedness and response efforts of city services, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. In collaboration with eight Community Emergency Response Teams of the Washington DC Metro region, we first defined a behavior schema of risk-preventing and risktaking behavior types for social media content that have the potential to inform the response operations for pandemic crises. We then developed a classification approach to automatically infer the risk behavior from social media posts using machine learning models and Twitter data collected during the period of March to May 2020. Our experimentation demonstrates a feasible automated solution to rapidly filter social media content with high efficiency (AUC up to 88%), which provides technological capabilities to assist future pandemic crisis management efforts of city services.",3

Attention Realignment and Pseudo-Labelling for Interpretable Cross-Lingual Classification of Crisis Tweets,"Jitin Krishnan, Hemant Purohit, Huzefa Rangwala",2020,Conference KDD-2020 Workshop,"State-of-the-art models for cross-lingual language understanding such as XLM-R [7] have shown great performance on benchmark data sets. However, they typically require some fine-tuning or customization to adapt to downstream NLP tasks for a domain. In this work, we study unsupervised cross-lingual text classification task in the context of crisis domain, where rapidly filtering relevant data regardless of language is critical to improve situational awareness of emergency services. Specifically, we address two research questions: a) Can a custom neural network model over XLM-R trained only in English for such classification task transfer knowledge to multilingual data and vice-versa? b) By employing an attention mechanism, does the model attend to words relevant to the task regardless of the language? To this goal, we present an attention realignment mechanism that utilizes a parallel language classifier to minimize any linguistic differences between the source and target languages. Additionally, we pseudo-label the tweets from the target language which is then augmented with the tweets in the source language for retraining the model. We conduct experiments using Twitter posts (tweets) labelled as a ‘request’in the open source data set by Appen 1, consisting of multilingual tweets for crisis response. Experimental results show that attention realignment and pseudo-labelling improve the performance of unsupervised crosslingual classification. We also present an interpretability analysis by evaluating the performance of attention layers on original versus translated messages.",3
Unsupervised and Interpretable Domain Adaptation to Rapidly Filter Social Web Data for Emergency Services,"Jitin Krishnan, Hemant Purohit, Huzefa Rangwala",2020,Conference 2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM),"During the onset of a disaster event, filtering relevant information from the social web data is challenging due to its sparse availability and practical limitations in labeling datasets of an ongoing crisis. In this paper, we show that unsupervised domain adaptation through multi-task learning can be a useful framework to leverage data from past crisis events, as well as exploit additional web resources for training efficient information filtering models during an ongoing crisis. We present a novel method to classify relevant tweets during an ongoing crisis without seeing any new examples, using the publicly available dataset of TREC incident streams that provides labeled tweets with 4 relevant classes across 10 different crisis events. Additionally, our method addresses a crucial but missing component from current research in web science for crisis data filtering models: interpretability. Specifically, we first identify a standard single-task attention-based neural network architecture and then construct a customized multi-task architecture for the crisis domain: Multi-Task Domain Adversarial Attention Network. This model consists of dedicated attention layers for each task and a domain classifier for gradient reversal. Evaluation of domain adaptation for crisis events is performed by choosing a target event as the test set and training on the rest. Our results show that the multi-task model outperformed its single-task counterpart and also, training with additional web-resources showed further performance boost. Furthermore, we show that the attention layer can be used as a guide to explain the model predictions by showcasing the words in a tweet that are deemed …",3
Classifying Relevant Social Media Posts During Disasters Using Ensemble of Domain-agnostic and Domain-specific Word Embeddings,"Ganesh Nalluru, Rahul Pandey, Hemant Purohit",2019/11/12,Conference AAAI Fall Symposium on AI for Social Good,"The use of social media as a means of communication has significantly increased over recent years. There is a plethora of information flow over the different topics of discussion, which is widespread across different domains. The ease of information sharing has increased noisy data being induced along with the relevant data stream. Finding such relevant data is important, especially when we are dealing with a time-critical domain like disasters. It is also more important to filter the relevant data in a real-time setting to timely process and leverage the information for decision support. However, the short text and sometimes ungrammatical nature of social media data challenge the extraction of contextual information cues, which could help differentiate relevant vs. non-relevant information. This paper presents a novel method to classify relevant social media posts during disaster events by ensembling the features of both domain-specific word embeddings as well as more generic domain-agnostic word embeddings. Therefore, we develop and evaluate a hybrid feature engineering framework for integrating diverse semantic representations using a combination of word embeddings to efficiently classify a relevant social media post. The application of the proposed classification framework could help in filtering public posts at large scale, given the growing usage of social media posts in recent years.",3

EMAssistant: A Learning Analytics System for Social and Web Data Filtering to Assist Trainees and Volunteers of Emergency Services,"Rahul Pandey, Gaurav Bahl, Hemant Purohit",2019/5,Journal The 16th International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response And Management,"An increasing number of Machine Learning based systems are being designed to filter and visualize the relevant information from social media and web streams for disaster management. Given the dynamic disaster events, the notion of​ relevant information evolves, and thus, the active learning techniques are often considered to keep updating the predictive models for the relevant information filtering. However, the active relevant feedback provided by the human annotators to update the models are not validated. As a result, they can introduce unconscious biases in the learning process of humans and can result in an inaccurate or inefficient predictive system. Therefore, this paper describes the design and implementation of an open-source technology-based learning analytics system ‘​ EMAssistant​’for the emergency volunteers or practitioners-referred as the trainee, to enhance their experiential learning cycle with the cause-effect reasoning on providing relevant feedback to the machine learning model. This continuous integration between the cause (providing feedback) and the effect (observing predictions from the updated model) in a visual form will likely to improve the understanding of the trainees to provide more accurate feedback.

Modeling Transportation Uncertainty in Matching Help Seekers and Suppliers during Disasters,"Hemant Purohit, Nikhita Vedula, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, Srinivasan Parthasarathy",2018,Conference ACM SIGIR Workshop on Intelligent Transportation Informatics,"Social web empowers citizens to express urgent calls for needs and o ers of help during disasters. Identifying and matching those who need help with those who o er help for the required resources in real time on the social web has multiple outcomes. Such a matching can assist responding agencies in realistic estimation of needs and allocation of resources by region. It can also enable individual users in making decisions of where and whom to o er help, thus, supporting overall ‘citizen-driven’relief coordination (eg,# OccupySandy,# harveyrelief on Twitter). However, it is challenging to timely match users online and connect them o ine due to the incomplete information and dynamic unavailability of transportation routes, that result from the damage of an evolving disaster. In this paper, we address these challenges by formulating a novel problem of multi-objective bipartite matching, and proposing a generalizable solution of a Social Matching Framework (SMF).

Modeling policy-relevant intent related to gender violence myths on social media using social construction theory,"Hemant Purohit, Bonnie Stabile, Aubrey Grant, Rahul Pandey",2018,Journal International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2),"The recent surge in women reporting (eg,# metoo campaign) gender violence incidents of sexual assault and harassment has highlighted a long-standing societal crisis. The injustice endured by victims has been due, in part, to a culture that embraces rape myths and discredits women who report such crimes, especially the myth “women lie about rape”, which has been found to be one of the most frequently endorsed rape myths [1]. Given the increasing adoption of social media by different sections of the society, it can be explored as a novel data source to identify public attitudes–complementary to survey-based methods–that reflect and perpetuate prevailing social constructions towards the accused and accusers of sexual assault. Social media platforms facilitate informal online conversations and thus, present an opportunity to understand intentional messaging by users. This analysis identifies prominent Twitter message themes regarding sexual assault, with an eye towards understanding the extent of rape myths-especially the myth that ‘women lie about rape’.

PROBER: A System for Real-time Propaganda Behavior Analytics on Social Media and Web Data Streams,"Yasas Senarath, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Tonya Thornton, Hemant Purohit",2022/12/17,Conference 2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),"Social media and online platforms provide a public space for many people to share opinions. Social media has numerous benefits to society; however, previous research has identified that individuals use social media for propagandizing purposes which can be detrimental to society, especially during humanitarian crises. Therefore, communities must look into this content to understand and effectively mitigate propaganda, especially when social media messages contain targeted hate or fake/disinformation. In this paper, we propose a human-centered system called PROBER, for propaganda behavior analytics in social and web data streams, which the relevant authorities, such as government institutions, could use for operational decision support and informing policy analysts for crisis management.",
VUER: A model for rating videos to curate content for learning,"Rahul Pandey, Hemant Purohit, Aditya Johri",2022/9,Journal Education and Information Technologies,"Videos are an engaging medium for learning as they provide affordances beyond text or audio-only, thereby allowing the creator more flexibility for content generation. Easy access to videos on the Web and their popularity within everyday discourse has made them an accepted medium for teaching and learning. However, this increase in the availability of videos makes it challenging for an instructor, teacher, or learner to assess their viability for learning. Each search can lead to thousands of videos on a given topic. Although content platforms and search engines use a range of data and algorithms for the recommendation, these are not tailored to recommend video content specifically for learning. In this paper, we present and test a theoretically motivated model to rate videos on their potential to support learning goals. Visual Appeal, Understanding of Content, Engagement with Topic, and Recommendation …",
Human-AI Teaming for COVID-19 Response: A Practice & Research Collaboration Case Study,"Amanda L Hughes, Keri K Stephens, Steve Peterson, Hemant Purohit, Anastazja G Harris, Yasas Senarath, S Ashley Jarvis, Carolyn E Montagnolo, Karim Nader",2022,Conference ISCRAM-2022,"Practice and research collaborations in the disaster domain have the potential to improve emergency management practices while also advancing disaster science theory. However, they also pose challenges as practitioners and researchers each have their own culture, history, values, incentives, and processes that do not always facilitate collaboration. In this paper, we reflect on a 6-month practice and research collaboration, where researchers and practitioners worked together to craft a social media monitoring system for emergency managers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenges we encountered in this project fall into two broad categories, job-related and timescale challenges. Using prior research on team science as a guide, we discuss several challenges we encountered in these two categories and show how our team sought to overcome them. We conclude with a set of best practices for improving practice and research collaborations.",
Improving Diversity in Engineering: A Data-Driven Approach to Support Resource Mobilization and Participation in Hashtag Activism Campaigns,"Habib Karbasian, Hemant Purohit, Aditya Johri",2021/8/30,Book Proceedings of the 32nd ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media,"A critical barrier facing engineering is inclusiveness of women in the profession. In recent years, engineering diversity advocates have taken to social media platforms to raise awareness of the issue and redress this problem. A recurring challenge for their initiatives though is attracting and mobilizing participants efficiently. For a successful mobilization campaign, organizers need real-time information about their users and also need to understand what messaging works to attract and mobilize them. We hypothesize that participants in any given campaign related to engineering diversity will also be interested in other campaigns related to that issue. Furthermore, since the primary signal for a social media campaign is a hashtag, by using clustering patterns of various co-occurring hashtags along with relevant topics and relatable sentiments, we can better understand participation and also mobilize users for the target …",

Lessons from the 2020 AAAI fall symposium on AI for social good,"O Seneviratne, H Purohit, MA Ahmad",2020,"Journal 2020 AAAI Fall Symposium on AI for Social Good, AI4SG 2020","Recent developments in big data and computational power are revolutionizing several domains, opening up new opportunities and challenges. In this symposium, we highlighted two specific themes, namely humanitarian relief and healthcare, where AI could be used for social good to achieve the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs) in those areas, which touch every aspect of human, social, and economic development. The talks at the symposium were focused on identifying the critical needs and pathways for responsible AI solutions to achieve SDGs, which demand holistic thinking on optimizing the trade-off between automation benefits and their potential side-effects, especially in a year that has upended societies globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

# ILookLikeAnEngineer: Using Social Media-Based Hashtag Activism Campaigns as a Lens to Better Understand Engineering Diversity Issues,"Aditya Johri, Habib Karbasian, Aqdas Malik, Rajat Handa, Hemant Purohit",2018/4/29,Conference 2018 CoNECD-The Collaborative Network for Engineering and Computing Diversity Conference,"Each year, significant investment of time and resources is made to improve diversity within engineering across a range of federal and state agencies, private/not-for-profit organizations, and foundations. In spite of decades of investments, efforts have not yielded desired returns-participation by minorities continues to lag at a time when STEM workforce requirements are increasing. In recent years a new stream of data has emerged-online social networks, including Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn-that acts as a key sensor of social behavior and attitudes among the US population. Almost 87% of the American population now participates in some form of social media activity. Consequently, social networking sites have become powerful indicators of social action and social media data has shown significant promise for studying many issues including public health communication, political climate, humanitarian crisis, and, social movements. We argue that social media data can likewise be leveraged to better understand and improve engineering diversity. As a case study to illustrate the viability of the approach, we present findings from a campaign,# ILookLikeandEngineer, aimed at increasing gender diversity in the engineering workplace. We collected 19,354 original Tweets and 29,529 Retweets. For each Tweet, we extracted the following metadata: text, retweet count, favorite count, and time of tweet; for the user: name, screen name, location, followers, following, likes, and number of statuses. Our analysis of the data demonstrates that although diversity initiatives attract a lot of voices in support of diversity, on the ground action is limited …",

Mining Behavior of Citizen Sensor Communities to Improve Cooperation with Organizational Actors,Hemant Purohit,2015,Institution Wright State University,"Web 2.0 (social media) provides a natural platform for dynamic emergence of citizen (as) sensor communities, where the citizens generate content for sharing information and engaging in discussions. Such a citizen sensor community (CSC) has stated or implied goals that are helpful in the work of formal organizations, such as an emergency management unit, for prioritizing their response needs. This research addresses questions related to design of a cooperative system of organizations and citizens in CSC. Prior research by social scientists in a limited offline and online environment has provided a foundation for research on cooperative behavior challenges, including'articulation'and'awareness', but Web 2.0 supported CSC offers new challenges as well as opportunities. A CSC presents information overload for the organizational actors, especially in finding reliable information providers (for awareness), and finding actionable information from the data generated by citizens (for articulation). Also, we note three data level challenges: ambiguity in interpreting unconstrained natural language text, sparsity of user behaviors, and diversity of user demographics. Interdisciplinary research involving social and computer sciences is essential to address these socio-technical issues. I present a novel web information-processing framework, called the Identify-Match-Engage (IME) framework. IME allows operationalizing computation in design problems of awareness and articulation of the cooperative system between citizens and organizations, by addressing data problems of group engagement modeling and intent mining. The IME framework includes: a …",

Towards a Design of Resilience Data Repository for Community Resilience,"Hoang Long Nguyen, Yasas Senarath, Hemant Purohit, Rajendra Akerkar","Community resilience is coming under scrutiny recently because of its need to support communities in preparing and protecting lives against risks and bouncing back to normal operations after disruptions. However, community resilience is an intricate concept that is arduous to capture and turn into explicit knowledge. This motivated us to propose a general architecture for a resilience data repository that enables communities to adopt a general methodology for collecting, storing, managing, and sharing resilience-based information. To ensure that the repository is useful and practical, we started with in-depth literature review and conducted survey with practitioners to obtain their insights into community resilience and potential data sources from local communities. Furthermore, we presented the utility of the repository by describing several potential applications. Information systems professionals of community stakeholders and disaster management agencies can construct their own resilience repositories by utilising the proposed design of the architecture.","Scholar articles Towards a Design of Resilience Data Repository for Community ResilienceHL Nguyen, Y Senarath, H Purohit, R AkerkarRelated articles All 4 versions ","Community resilience is coming under scrutiny recently because of its need to support communities in preparing and protecting lives against risks and bouncing back to normal operations after disruptions.

"With Whom to Coordinate, Why and How in Ad-Hoc Social Media Communications during Crisis","Hemant Purohit, Shreyansh Bhatt, Andrew Hampton, Valerie L Shalin, Amit P Sheth","During crises directly affected people and observers join social media communities to discuss the event. They may share information relevant to response coordination, for example, specific resource needs. However, responders face a massive data overload and lack the time to monitor social media traffic for important and trustworthy information. To address these challenges, response teams may attempt manual filtering methods, resulting in limited coverage and quality. Hence, we propose a computational framework for extracting specific resource-related information, and an interface for identifying and engaging with influential participants in the dynamic, evolving social media community. Our approach helps to identify those virtual responders who serve both as sources and disseminators of important information to assist in coordinated emergency response.","Scholar articles With Whom to Coordinate, Why and How in Ad-Hoc Social Media Communications during CrisisH Purohit, S Bhatt, A Hampton, VL Shalin, AP ShethRelated articles ","During crises directly affected people and observers join social media communities to discuss the event.
