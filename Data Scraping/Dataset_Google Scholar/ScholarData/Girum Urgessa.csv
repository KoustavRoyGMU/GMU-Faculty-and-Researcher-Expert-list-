Dynamic response of retrofitted masonry walls for blast loading,"Girum S Urgessa, Arup K Maji",2010/7,Journal Journal of Engineering Mechanics,A full-scale blast test was conducted on eight masonry walls reinforced with two and four layers of carbon fibers and two types of polymer matrices. The walls were then subjected to a 0.45-kg pentolite booster suspended from the ceiling of a test structure. The pressure-time history caused by the blast and the resulting displacement response were measured during the test. This paper presents a summary of the test program and the corresponding results from a nonlinear single degree of freedom analysis. The results provide a basis for determining effective means of retrofitting existing masonry walls and designing new structures to withstand blast loads. The paper also outlines a fiber-reinforced polymer retrofit design procedure for walls subjected to blast loading.,61
Blast response comparison of multiple steel frame connections,"Girum S Urgessa, Tomasz Arciszewski",2011/7/1,Journal Finite Elements in Analysis and Design,"When a structural steel frame is subjected to blast, the beam-to-column connections, which are responsible for load transfer between different members within the frame, play a major role in structural response. This paper presents results of a comparative finite element analysis of a steel frame subjected to a blast loading from a vehicular threat. The study compared three connection systems referred as standard, TA and SidePlateTM. Connection plate thickness variations were also considered. Strain rate effects were included in the material constitutive model. The pressure–time histories were determined using FEFLO, a general purpose computational fluid dynamics program developed by the Center for Computational Fluid Dynamics at George Mason University. The numerical results were used to compare both the structural response and the constructability of frames with the studied connection types. Three …",59
Optimum design of 3D reinforced concrete frames using DMPSO algorithm,"M Javad Esfandiari, Girum S Urgessa, S Sheikholarefin, SH Dehghan Manshadi",2018/1/1,Journal Advances in Engineering Software,"Evolutionary optimization algorithms are widely used for solving optimization problems. However, in the realm of real-world structures finding the optimum design would be difficult and time-consuming due to large number of design variables, enormous size of the search space, and availability of numerous constraints. As a result, holistic optimization approaches that consider architectural and other practical requirements in addition to required code provisions are rather limited in real-world structures. This paper presents an innovative algorithm combining multi-criterion decision-making (DM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which is called DMPSO, for accelerating convergence toward optimum solution in 3D reinforced concrete (RC) frames. All practical requirements are considered for obtaining directly constructible designs without any further modifications. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is …",53

It was found that the low temperature PL spectra are driven by neutral donor bound exciton emission D0X, peaked at 3.359 and 3.363eV for APMOCVD and CBD ZnO nanorods, respectively. The temperature increase causes a red energy shift of the peaks and enhancement of the free excitonic emission (FX). The FX was found to dominate after 150K for both samples. It was observed that while APMOCVD ZnO nanorods possess a constant low signal of visible deep level emission with temperature, the ZnO nanorods grown by CBD revealed the thermal activation of deep level emission (DLE) after 130K.

Full-scale testing and analysis for blast-resistant design,"Arup K Maji, Jay P Brown, Girum S Urgessa",2008/10,Journal Journal of Aerospace Engineering,"A full-scale blast test was conducted on a structure representing a mailroom, constructed with unreinforced masonry walls. The four walls were retrofitted with different quantities of glass fiber-reinforced polymers (GFRP) on the outside face to increase their resistance to the blast load. In addition, shotcrete was added to the inside face of the two long walls. The objective of this test was to validate a method of analysis that can be used to design effective retrofit techniques to contain blast loads. A blast load was produced by the detonation of a   equivalent TNT charge placed near the center of the room. Instrumentation on individual walls monitored the blast pressure and the consequent displacement and velocity of the walls. Although the walls sustained extensive internal damage and plastic deformation, the retrofit was able to withstand the blast load. It was observed through the postmortem analysis of the …",33
Optimization of reinforced concrete frames subjected to historical time-history loadings using DMPSO algorithm,"MJ Esfandiari, GS Urgessa, S Sheikholarefin, SH Dehghan Manshadi",2018/11,Journal Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization,"In this paper, the seismic design of reinforced concrete (RC) frames subjected to time-history loadings was formulated as an optimization problem. Because finding the optimum design is relatively difficult and time-consuming for structural dynamics problems, an innovative algorithm combining multi-criterion decision-making (DM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), called DMPSO, was presented for accelerating convergence toward the optimum solution. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was illustrated in some benchmark reinforced concrete optimization problems. The main goal was to minimize the cost or weight of structures subjected to time-history loadings while satisfying all design requirements imposed by building design codes. The results confirmed the ability of the proposed algorithm to find the optimal solutions for structural optimization problems subjected to time-history loadings.",26
Thermal responses of concrete slabs containing microencapsulated low-transition temperature phase change materials exposed to realistic climate conditions,"Girum Urgessa, Kyong-Ku Yun, Jaeheum Yeon, Jung Heum Yeon",2019/11/1,Journal Cement and Concrete Composites,"This study examines the effect of microencapsulated low-transition temperature phase change material (PCM) additions on the thermal response of concrete slabs subjected to long-term realistic environmental exposure. To prevent direct contact of PCM with cement hydration products and possible leakage upon liquefaction, an inert PCM was encapsulated with a melamine-formaldehyde resin via an emulsification process before being added in concrete mixtures. Temperature monitoring was performed on three 500 × 500 × 150 mm large-scale concrete slabs with and without PCM for about 14 months encompassing two cold winter seasons. Results indicated that the addition of microencapsulated PCM effectively reduced excessive temperature drop and the number of freeze-thaw cycles concrete slabs experience during winter seasons, which may lead to service life extension by up to 5.2%–35.9% based …",25
Numerical prediction model for temperature distributions in concrete at early ages,"Wondwosen Ali, Girum Urgessa",2012,Journal American Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences,A finite element-finite difference numerical model is developed for predicting non-uniform temperature development in hydrating concrete with respect to time and space. The results obtained from this model can be used by structural and construction engineers to predict critical thermal stresses induced due to differential temperatures between the core and the surface of the concrete at early ages and between the zero-stress temperatures and the minimum equilibrating ambient temperatures that the concrete experiences during its service life. The prediction of zero-stress temperatures also enables to quantify the extent of builtin curl developed in concrete structures. The finite element is used to space discretization while the finite difference is used to obtain transient solutions of the model. The numerical formulations are then programmed in Matlab. The numerical results were compared with experimental results found in literature and demonstrated very good agreement.,22
Vibration properties of beams using frequency-domain system identification methods,Girum S Urgessa,2011/8,Journal Journal of Vibration and Control,"The application of system identification methods to a number of civil engineering structures is increasing in order to improve the understanding of actual structural behaviors and augment traditional analytical assessments. The identification methods are typically used to determine structural dynamics properties (frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes) and detection of local structural damages and deterioration. This paper presents two frequency domain system identification methods for determining structural vibration properties: eigensystem realization algorithm and the McKelvey frequency domain subspace algorithm. The methods were used in order to formulate a mathematical model that closely matches the frequency response function obtained from a vibration experiment conducted on an uncontrolled cantilever plate.

"Internal relative humidity, autogenous shrinkage, and strength of cement mortar modified with superabsorbent polymers","Girum Urgessa, Ki-Bong Choi, Jung Heum Yeon",2018/9/28,Journal Polymers,"Laboratory evaluations were performed to investigate the effect of internal curing (IC) by superabsorbent polymers (SAP) on the internal relative humidity (IRH), autogenous shrinkage, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and strength characteristics of low water-cement ratio (w/c) mortars. Four types of SAP with different cross-linking densities and particle sizes were used. Test results showed that the SAP inclusion effectively mitigated the IRH drops due to self-desiccation and corresponding autogenous shrinkage, and the IC effectiveness tended to increase with an increased SAP dosage. The greater the cross-linking density and particle size of SAP, the less the IRH drop and autogenous shrinkage. The trend of autogenous shrinkage developments was in good agreement with that of IRH changes, with nearly linear relationships between them. Both immediate deformation (ID)-based and full response-based CTEs were rarely affected by SAP inclusions. There were no substantial losses in compressive and flexural strengths of SAP-modified mortar compared to reference plain mortar. The findings revealed that SAPs can be effectively used to reduce the shrinkage cracking potential of low w/c cement-based materials at early ages, without compromising mechanical and thermal characteristics.",21
Mechanisms of self-assembly in solution grown ZnO nanorods,"ZN Urgessa, K Talla, SR Dobson, OS Oluwafemi, EJ Olivier, JH Neethling, JR Botha",2013/10/1,Journal Materials Letters,"The mechanisms for self-assembly of ZnO nanorods grown by chemical bath deposition are investigated in detail. Using a combination of scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, the growth mechanism of ZnO nanostructures from a solution was studied. The study revealed that the mechanism of nucleation is the crucial step in controlling the morphology, orientation and distribution of the nanostructures on a silicon substrate. In the absence of a seed layer, rods initially nucleated from eroded regions in precipitated Zn(OH)2 lead to the formation of flower-like, hemi-spherically arranged nanorods. In the presence of a higher density seed layer, well-aligned nanorods form on the seed layer coated substrate as a result of competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation. In general, the initial precipitation of Zn(OH)2 in a basic solution followed by its …",16
Finite element analysis of composite hardened walls subjected to blast loads,Girum S Urgessa,2009/9,Journal Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences,"Problem statement: There is currently no standard design guideline to determine the number of composites needed to retrofit masonry walls in order to withstand a given explosion. Past design approaches were mainly based on simplified single-degree-of-freedom analysis. A finite element analysis was conducted for concrete masonry walls hardened with composites and subjected to short duration blast loads. Approach: The analysis focused on displacement time history responses which form the basis for retrofit design guidelines against blast loadings. The blast was determined from 0.5 kg equivalent TNT explosive at 1.83 m stand-off distance to simulate small mailroom bombs. Two and four layered retrofitted walls were investigated. Uncertainties in the finite model analysis of walls such as pressure distributions, effect of mid height explosive bursts versus near the ground explosive bursts and variations in modulus of elasticity of the wall were presented. Results: Uniformly distributed blast loads over the retrofitted wall height produced a small difference in peak displacement results when compared to the non-uniform pressure distribution. Ground explosive burst was shown to produce a 62.7% increase in energy and a higher peak displacement response when compared to midheight explosive burst. Conclusion: The parametric study on the variation of modulus of elasticity of concrete masonry showed no significant effect on peak displacement affirming the use of the resistance deflection contribution of the composite in retrofit designs.",16

The presence of H on the surface and throughout the entire thickness of ZNs is confirmed by TOF-SIMS. Based on TOF-SIMS results, the O2 XPS peak mostly observable at ~531.5 is assigned to O bound to H. Furthermore, it is found that the near surface region of as-grown ZNs is Zn-rich, and annealing at high temperature (~850 °C) removes H-related defects from the surface of ZNs and affect the balance of zinc and oxygen concentrations.",15
Structural assessment of fiber-reinforced polymer composite electric poles,"Girum Urgessa, Sara Mohamadi",2016/1/1,Journal Procedia engineering,"Engineers are increasingly tasked with designing and operating structures that incorporate the philosophy of resiliency across a variety of critical infrastructure sectors. Electric distribution and transmission systems are examples of the critical infrastructure sectors. The majority of existing electrical poles supporting electric distribution systems in the United States are made out of wood. It is estimated that up to 3.6 million existing electric wood poles have to be replaced every year. One of the primary hardening strategies is upgrading wooden electric poles and supporting structures with stronger materials that withstand hurricane-force winds.

Progressive collapse design of reinforced concrete frames using structural optimization and machine learning,"MJ Esfandiari, GS Urgessa",2020/12/1,Journal Structures,"This paper uses an innovative algorithm combining machine learning as a decision-maker (DM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), called DMPSO, as a structural optimization technique, to design reinforced concrete frames for progressive collapse employing the alternate path method. In the alternate path method, multiple scenarios of removing critical elements should be considered, which makes the design process extremely repetitive and costly. Therefore, the development of an optimization technique is beneficial for producing efficient and cost-effective design solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm is illustrated in optimization of a reinforced concrete structure that is subjected to lateral seismic forces, while the design concurrently satisfies both the American Concrete Institute provisions and the Unified Facilitates Criteria progressive collapse requirements.

The electrodes were sensitized using the organic indoline dye DN216 and dye-sensitized solar cells were prepared. Charge transfer dynamics and light harvesting properties were studied by absorbance spectroscopy, I–V measurements, voltage-decay measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The introduction of EosinY to the precursor solution was found to increase the diameter of the rods and to produce nano-scale roughness.

Quasi-balanced failure approach for evaluating moment capacity of FRP underreinforced concrete beams,"Kyoung-Kyu Choi, Girum Urgessa, Mahmoud M Taha, Arup K Maji",2008/6,Journal Journal of Composites for Construction,"Failure of concrete beam sections underreinforced with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) is initiated by FRP rupture before concrete crushing. In such a case, the typical rectangular stress block based on the balanced failure mechanism may not apply. In the present study, rigorous sectional analyses are performed implementing existing concrete stress-strain models for a wide range of values of design parameters. Based on the results of the numerical analyses, the variation of parameters of equivalent stress block of concrete was investigated, and an alternative, yet simple, design method for evaluating moment-carrying capacity of FRP underreinforced concrete beam using quasi-balanced failure approach was developed. The proposed design method was verified by comparing the predicted moment-carrying capacity with existing test results.",12
Significance of Stress-block Parameters on the Moment Capacity of Sections Under-reinforced with FRP,"G Urgessa, S Horton, MM Reda Taha, A Maji",2005/10/1,Journal Special Publication,"For under-reinforced concrete sections reinforced with FRP, failure of a member is initiated by rupture of the FRP bar and the typical ACI compression stressblock might not be applicable. This is because of the fact that the corresponding strain at the extreme fiber of the concrete will not reach the ultimate strain in concrete. Therefore, accurate computation of flexural capacity requires developing equivalent stress-block parameters that represent the stress distribution in the concrete at a particular strain level. While the ACI 440 permits the use of a simplified approach to calculate moment capacities that do not require equivalent stress-block calculations, the significance of this simplification needs to be examined. This paper suggests a family of curves based on the extreme fiber strain in concrete using three existing stress-strain models. The paper highlights the significance of these curves for different values of compressive strengths of concrete.",12

Structural capacities of spherically voided biaxial slab (SVBS),"Wondwosen B Ali, Girum S Urgessa",2014,Book Structures Congress 2014,"Demand for a lighter and safer concrete floor system to improve the span limit resulted from the high weight-to-stiffness/strength ratios of a solid, reinforced concrete slab has led to the emergence of spherically voided biaxial slab (SVBS). However, the voids impart a non-prismatic nature in both in-plane directions of this new slab system. Because of this non-prismatic nature, determination of stiffness and structural capacity of a spherically voided biaxial slab is inherently challenging. The inclusion of the voids is intuitively expected to compromise the stiffness and structural capacity of the slab. However, the extent of the compromise is not explicitly known. Therefore, in this paper, the reduction of the stiffness and structural capacities of the spherically voided slab is investigated in comparison to a solid slab with equal dimensions.

Computational model for internal relative humidity distributions in concrete,"Wondwosen Ali, Girum Urgessa",2014,Journal Journal of Computational Engineering,"A computational model is developed for predicting nonuniform internal relative humidity distribution in concrete. Internal relative humidity distribution is known to have a direct effect on the nonuniform drying shrinkage strains. These nonuniform drying shrinkage strains result in the buildup of internal stresses, which may lead to cracking of concrete. This may be particularly true at early ages of concrete since the concrete is relatively weak while the difference in internal relative humidity is probably high. The results obtained from this model can be used by structural and construction engineers to predict critical drying shrinkage stresses induced due to differential internal humidity distribution. The model uses finite elment-finite difference numerical methods. The finite element is used to space discretization while the finite difference is used to obtain transient solutions of the model. The numerical formulations are then programmed in Matlab. The numerical results were compared with experimental results found in the literature and demonstrated very good agreement.",8

Two Dimensional Micromechanics Based Computational Model for Spherically Voided Biaxial Slabs (SVBS),Wondwosen Belay Ali,2014,Institution George Mason University,"The demand for reducing the weight-to-stiffness and strength ratios of solid reinforced concrete slabs, while improving their span limit, has led to the emergence of spherically voided biaxial slab (SVBS) systems. However, the presence of the spherical voids makes the structural analysis of SVBS inherently challenging because of the heterogeneous and periodically varying complex cross-sectional geometry. Current analysis procedures heavily rely on proprietary manufacturer information with a recommendation of treating SVBS as solid reinforced concrete slabs and applying global reduction factors without giving regard to the microstructures of the SVBS itself. This dissertation presents new load-response analysis models that use a finite element based micromechanical homogenization procedure for predicting the elastic structural behavior of SVBS. Firstly, a representative volume element (RVE) or unit cell of a …",7
Influence of non-uniform elevated temperature on the structural stability and strength of gypsum-sheathed cold-formed steel beam channel members,Elias Ali,2021,Journal Journal of Civil Engineering and Architecture,"The objective of this paper is to computationally explore the structural stability and strength of gypsum-protected CFS (cold-formed steel) beam channel sections under non-uniform elevated temperatures when exposed to standard fire on one side of the panel and subjected to pure bending. When a CFS member is subjected to fire (or thermal gradients) its material properties change—but this change happens around the cross-section and along the length creating a member which is potentially non-uniform and unsymmetrical in its response even if the apparent geometry is uniform and symmetric. Computational finite element models were analyzed in ABAQUS to establish steady-state thermal gradients of interest. Existing test data were utilized to develop the temperature dependence of the stress-strain response. The time-dependent temperature distribution on the cross-sections obtained from heat transfer analysis was later used in the stability and collapse analyses. The stability of the models was explored to characterize how local, distortional, and global buckling of the member evolves under both uniform and non-uniform temperature distributions. Finally, collapse simulations were performed to characterize the strength under pure bending and explore directly the evolution of strength under the influence of non-uniform temperature.",6

Technology,"Predicting explosion parameters is an important step when planning for blast tests or the design of blast resistant buildings. is paper presents a comparison of recorded pressure that was reflected on the surface of reinforced concrete slabs with and without EPS (Expanded Polystyrene) foam retrofit measured from a detonation of 2.7 kg of non-confined plastic explosive. Two 50 MPa reinforced concrete slabs measuring 1.0 x1. 0x0. 08 m, simply supported on two sides were tested. e explosive was suspended at a distance of 2.0 m from the upper surface of the slabs; one of the slabs had 5.0 cm thick foam on the top side. Eight piezoelectric pressure sensors were positioned at a distance of 2.0 m from the explosive. Results showed that the foam retrofit reduced the reflected pressure by approximately 57% when compared to the slab without EPS foam retrofit.",6
Toward more robust and real-time unmanned aerial vehicle detection and tracking via cross-scale feature aggregation based on the center keypoint,"Min Bao, Guyo Chala Urgessa, Mengdao Xing, Liang Han, Rui Chen",2021/4/7,Journal Remote sensing,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an essential role in various applications, such as transportation and intelligent environmental sensing. However, due to camera motion and complex environments, it can be difficult to recognize the UAV from its surroundings thus, traditional methods often miss detection of UAVs and generate false alarms. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for detecting and tracking UAVs. First, a cross-scale feature aggregation CenterNet (CFACN) is constructed to recognize the UAVs. CFACN is a free anchor-based center point estimation method that can effectively decrease the false alarm rate, the misdetection of small targets, and computational complexity. Secondly, the region of interest-scale-crop-resize (RSCR) method is utilized to merge CFACN and region-of-interest (ROI) CFACN (ROI-CFACN) further, in order to improve the accuracy at a lower computational cost. Finally, the Kalman filter is adopted to track the UAV. The effectiveness of our method is validated using a collected UAV dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods can achieve higher accuracy with lower computational cost, being superior to BiFPN, CenterNet, YoLo, and their variants on the same dataset.",5
Analysis and modeling of uniaxial compressive creep of MMA-modified unsaturated polyester polymer concrete,"Kwan-Kyu Kim, Girum S Urgessa, Jung Heum Yeon",2020/11/1,Journal Journal of Materials Research and Technology,"Creep and shrinkage are the major time-dependent phenomena occurring in concrete. Because they significantly affect the long-term dimensional changes and relaxation of restrained stresses in concrete, it is of great importance to accurately consider these characteristics in the structural analysis and design process. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the creep under uniaxial compression and linear setting shrinkage of unsaturated polyester (UP) polymer concrete modified with three different levels of methyl methacrylic (MMA) monomer (i.e., 10, 20, and 30 wt.%).

Quasi-static responses and associated failure mechanisms of cold-formed steel roof trusses,"Doaa Bondok, Hani Salim, Girum Urgessa",2021/3/15,Journal Engineering Structures,"The use of cold-formed steel trusses in roof framing has significantly increased recently. Cold-formed steel roof trusses are ideal and efficient systems for a variety of applications due to their design flexibility and ease of construction. Past research explored the behavior of these truss systems up to the ultimate capacity point; however, the inelastic behavior to the failure was not fully captured. Information about the response beyond the buckling point and the energy absorption capacities are missing and need to be investigated. In this paper, small-scale cold-formed steel roof truss specimens were tested to failure under quasi-static loading. The static resistance of these systems and the associated failure mechanisms were identified.

"Damage diagram of blast test results for determining reinforced concrete slab response for varying scaled distance, concrete strength and reinforcement ratio","Fausto B Mendonca, Girum S Urgessa, Luiz EN Almeida, Jose AFF Rocco",2021/3/17,Journal Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências,"Dynamic loads continue to draw the interest of structural engineers. The sources of these loads can be earthquakes, blast effects or transportation loads from railroads or highways. Especially for blast loads, terrorist attacks or military actions have caused many loses of lives and damages in several buildings. The verification of structural behavior is necessary to help designers to plan structures that support these loads and reduce damages. Although computer simulation with, specific software, have helped these designers, full-scale tests can provide valuable information about the real response of the structure. This paper presents damage diagram from ten full-scale field tests using approximately 2.70 kg of non-confined plastic bonded explosive against reinforced concrete slabs with different scaled distance, reinforcement ratio and concrete strength.

Strength of Flanged and Plain Cruciform Members,"Nicholas Harris, Girum Urgessa",2018,Journal Advances in Civil Engineering,"There are two different types of cruciform members used in practice. Flanged cruciform sections are typically fabricated from two hot-rolled WT sections welded to the web of a standard hot-rolled I section, whereas plain cruciform sections are typically fabricated from two symmetric rectangular plates welded in the form of a cross. Cruciform members that are subjected to combined compression and bending are typically limited by torsional buckling unlike conventional compression members (such as W-shapes) that are typically limited by flexural (Euler) buckling about their local weak axis of bending. Detailed guidance on the analysis of flanged and plain cruciform members is scarce in literature. Hence, this paper presents numerical studies on the strength capacities of both flanged and plain cruciform members that are subjected to combined compression and bending effects. Analysis results show the ability of flanged and plain cruciform to resist lateral-torsional buckling over longer unbraced lengths, allowing development of efficient plastic resistance.",3

Blast response of reinforced concrete slabs with varying standoff and steel reinforcement ratios,"FB Mendonca, JAFF Rocco, K Iha, G Urgessa",2016/7,"Journal The 42nd International Pyrotechnics Society Conference, Grand Junction, CO",Terrorist attacks and accidental explosions are occurring frequently in the world encompassing both military and civilian assets and life. These events bring hazards to essential and supporting structures and may lead to structural failure or loss of human life. These supporting structures are often made from reinforced or modified concrete. The objective of this study is to measure and analyze blast wave front of reinforced concrete structures from scaled tests. Reinforced concrete slabs with different values of static compressive strength and steel reinforcement were subjected to explosives of varying scaled distances. The slabs were subjected to non-confined C4 explosive and the displacement of the slab was measured during the explosion. The collected data were analyzed comparing the displacement results with equations in the literature. The analysis showed that the reinforcement ratio plays a bigger role in absorbing the blast energy before the concrete cracked.,2
Stability of large reinforcing column cages during temporary construction conditions,"Girum S Urgessa, David Lattanzi, Michael J Casey",2016/2/1,Journal Practice Periodical on Structural Design and Construction,"Reinforcing cages for large columns requires shoring during the fabrication and erection stages of construction before concrete is placed to form a permanent load-bearing structure.

They are fabricated horizontally, lifted by crane (tripped) to the vertical position, and then moved to either doweled bases or placed in drilled shafts. The individual bars (larger longitudinal bars along the cage’s length and smaller spiral or hoop bars around its circumference) are usually joined solely with tie wire. Once vertical, the cages are susceptible to lateral loads from wind and forces from construction activity, such as ironworkers climbing on the cages to place formwork. Internal bracing and/or a temporary support system are crucial for resisting lateral loads and improving cage rigidity during the construction process.

Finite Element Analysis of Experimentally Tested Concrete Slabs Subjected to Airblast.,"AS Augusto, FB Mendonça, G Urgessa, K Iha",2021/9/1,Journal Defence Science Journal,"Since the last century, concrete has been used to protect structures against intentional or accidental detonation of explosives. Recently, as concerns about terrorist activities and accidents in plants using explosives increase worldwide, the study of the behaviour of this type of material and any civil or military structure under the influence of explosions has increased. Among the lethal effects of explosive devices, which cause greater loads in structural elements is the airblast effect. For this reason, this paper presents a series of airblast finite element (FEM) simulations developed in Abaqus/Explicit®. To validate the computational method, such simulations are geometrically and structurally kept similar to full-scale tests conducted in a blast test area of the Science and Technology Aerospace Department (Brazilian Air Force). Both simulations and tests consisted of seven reinforced concrete slabs with compressive strengths of about 40 to 60 MPa, variable steel reinforcement areas, slab dimensions measuring 1× 1 m, and subjected to 2.7 kg of non-confined plastic bonded explosive. The results demonstrated that FEM simulations can predict the rupture of the tested slabs and how the effect occurs, showing a valid method to investigating the response of RC slabs when compared to expensive field tests. Differences in displacements were observed between the results of FEM simulations and blast field tests, mainly caused by the sensitivity of the case studied, limits of computational capacity, and intrinsic variations in the materials and sensors used in the field tests. However, these differences showed an order of magnitude compatible with the safety …",1

A Pull-down Dynamic Analysis of Two Span Steel Frames Subjected to Progressive Collapse,"M Esfandiari, G. Urgessa",2019/5,Conference The 10th International Structural Engineering and Construction Conference,"Progressive collapse, also known as disproportionate collapse, describes a chain reaction of structural element failures in which a primary structural element failure results in the failure of adjoining structural elements. It eventually causes widespread structural damages and a disproportionate collapse. While high level finite-element models incorporating non-linear dynamic analysis will produce more realistic results in progressive collapse scenarios, they are computationally time consuming. Therefore, the development of a non-linear time history pull-down model that is validated with experimental results would be beneficial for producing acceptable and efficient design solutions, particularly for practicing structural engineers. In this paper, a non-linear time history pull-down model of a two-span steel frame is analyzed in ETABS. The ETABS model results are compared with experimental results of two steel frames with two-spans conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The NIST experiments include beam-column assemblies from the second-floor framing system of a ten-story building and each span is 20 feet long.

Assessing Effectiveness of Shape Memory Alloys on the Response of Bolted T-Stub Connections Subjected to Cyclic Loading,"Ahmadreza Torabipour, Nima Asghari, Homa Haghighi, Shaghayegh Yaghoubi, Girum Urgessa",2023/1/30,Journal CivilEng,"This study presents finite element analysis of double split tee (DST) connections with high-strength steel bolts and coupled split tee sections, to evaluate various cyclic response parameters and elements. The investigation included quantifying connection behavior and hysteretic response, damage indexes, and failure modes. Over 40 specimens were simulated in ABAQUS under cyclic loading, including shape memory alloy (SMA)-built specimens. In the post-analysis phase, the T-stub thickness, the T-stub yield strength, the bolt preload and bolt number, and the stiffener type and stiffener material for the most significant parts of the DST connection were calculated. Simulation results showed that a lower ultimate moment yielded fewer needed stem bolts. The energy dissipation (ED) capacity increased as the horizontal distance between the stem bolts decreased. Additionally, increasing the strength of the bolt and T-stub by 15% resulted in a 3.86% increase in residual displacement (RD) for the bolt and a 1.73% decrease in residual displacement for the T-stub. T-stub stiffeners enhanced ED capacity by 31.7%. SMA materials were vulnerable to mode 1 failure when used in T-stubs, bolts, or stiffeners. However, the use of SMA increased the rate of energy dissipation. Adding stiffeners to the T-stubs altered the failure indexes and improved the pattern of failure modes. In addition, stiffeners decreased the rupture and pressure indexes. As a result, the failure index of a T-stub shifted from brittle failure to ductile failure.",
Numerical Simulation of Functionally-Graded-Material Pipes Under Blast Loading,"Elias Ali, Girum Urgessa",2022/6/8,Book Advances in Structural Mechanics and Applications: Proceedings of ASMA-2021,"The behavior of thin-walled pipes made from Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) under localized blast loading was examined through numerical simulation. FGMs are advanced composite materials, which possess continuous variation of material properties in the thickness direction. FGM pipes with varying thicknesses and diameters subjected to blast loads from a 0.1 kg TNT charge at varying stand-off distances of detonations were considered. The composition of the FGM pipes was defined by using the volume fractions of the constituent materials distributed across the thickness. The general rule of mixtures was used to predict the material property of the FGM pipes. The pipes were assumed to be restrained for both translation and rotation at their ends. Finite element modeling was conducted using the coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) approach. The influence of constituent material gradation on blast …",
An Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach to Future Navy Fleet Investment Assessments,Matthew J Powers,2022,Institution George Mason University,"Navy decision makers and program sponsors must decide on future investments in the context of forecasted threats and operating environments. Investment assessments are difficult in that forecasted costs and utilities are oftentimes based on non-existent resources and technology. Forecasted projection model vectors are informed by current data that reflect similar or “close as possible” technologies, and are limited to scenario scope. That is, the common assessment modeling method of placing representative agents in a scenario-based simulation to assess future investment utilities are limited by scenario and design capabilities.",

A Combined Genetic Algorithm-Artificial Neural Network Optimization Method for Mix Design of Self Consolidating Concrete,"Amirhossein Tahmouresi, Amir Robati, Girum Urgessa, Homa Haghighi",2021/3/18,"Description The use of intelligent optimization and modeling methods is rapidly increasing in many fields including concrete technology. In recent years, concrete mix design has been studied using intelligent models in which the artificial neural networks are among the most popular and widely utilized method. However, this modeling depends on an optimization process, and the structured model should be tuned by implementing optimization techniques. Additionally, finding the most appropriate neural network structure for solving the concrete mix design problem was proven to be an important challenge in the state-of-the art. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel strategy in which an evolutionary algorithm and a structure of artificial neural network were fused to find the best network for modeling the compressive strength of Self Consolidating Concrete (SCC) and to extract the most optimal mix design. The novel strategy is tested using 169 data-sets with each set containing 11 concrete constituent properties. The proposed GA-ANN-GA strategy not only finds the best model but also presents the most optimal mix design of concrete to mitigate the challenges reported in recent studies.","The use of intelligent optimization and modeling methods is rapidly increasing in many fields including concrete technology.

"The Influence Of Strain Rate, Temperature Effects, And Instabilities In Failure Modeling For Metal Alloys",Stefano Dolci,2021,Institution George Mason University,"To improve the survivability of structures it is important to understand the dynamic failure behavior under impact loading. Impact tests have revealed that mode of failure on metal superalloys thick plate at high-speed impact is what is known as Adiabatic shear band (ASB). The tabulated JC material model is the current state of the art for FEM of high velocity impacts. The development of the tabulated JC material model started from the consideration that materials under impact are affected by large deformations, high strain rates, temperature softening, and varying stress-states and that the failure is also changing as a function of the state of stress.",
Digital Twin Analytics; Life-Cycle Modeling of Structures for Present and Future Condition Assessment,Sara Mohamadi,2021,Institution George Mason University,"The evaluation of structural systems is a necessary task in order to maintain the integrity of structures over time. These assessments are designed to detect damages of structures and ideally help inspectors to estimate the remaining life of structures. Current methodologies for monitoring structural systems, while providing useful information about the current state of the structures, are limited in the monitoring of structural defects over time and linking them to predictive simulation.

An Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach to Determine the Optimal Draft Strategy for a Single Team during the National Football League Draft,Ira L Crofford Jr,2021,Institution George Mason University,"The purpose of this research is to determine the optimal strategy for a single team when participating in the National Football League (NFL) Draft using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). General managers and coaches currently draft the best player available (BPA), a player that fills a certain positional need, or a hybrid of the two. Also, general managers must make sequential decisions in terms of trading up to go for a specific player while sacrificing future draft capital or possibly trading back and gaining more future draft capital. If done correctly, teams hope to still get their specific player, but for the right cost in terms of when the player gets drafted. In other words, a team wants to draft a player when he should have been drafted according to his skill set, not much earlier. This research attempts to answer when a team should trade up, when a team should trade back, when they should draft for team needs …",
"Market Chain Analysis of Mango: The Case of Babile District, East Harerghe Zone, Oromia National Regional State, Ethiopia","Mesfin Abebe, Prof Haji",2020,Institution Haramaya university,"Ethiopia has a potential for mango production in different agro ecological Zones by small farmers in general and Babile district in particular, mainly as a source of income as well as food. The nature of the product on one hand and the lack of market system on the other hand have resulted in low producers’ price and hence low benefit by the producers. This study was carried out to analyze the market chain analysis of mango. Multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select mango producers. Three kebeles were selected based on the simple random sampling method from the available 14 mango producing kebeles. The data was collected from 121 mango producing households those were selected using two stages PPS (probability proportional to size) and systematic random sampling method. Twenty eight market actors (6 local collectors, 5 wholesalers, 9 retailers and 8 processors) were selected using systematic random sampling method. Structure, Conduct and Performance (SCP) approach was used to analyze mango market. However, OLS (Multiple linear regression model) was used to analyzed factors that determine mango marketed supply of the producers in the study area. Mango market structure in the area shows the competitive nature. Analysis of marketing costs showed processors incur highest cost for processing of mango product and the marketing margins revealed that processors (juice houses) received the highest 71.80% of the total consumers’ price in channel I (Producers-Processors-Consumers channel) and on the same channel producers received the least 28.20% of the total consumers’ price than other channels …",
Analysis and modeling of uniaxial compressive creep of MMA-modified unsaturated polyester polymer concrete,"Kwan-Kyu Kim, Girum S Urgessa, Jung Heum Yeon",2020/11/1,Journal Journal of Materials Research and Technology,"Creep and shrinkage are the major time-dependent phenomena occurring in concrete. Because they significantly affect the long-term dimensional changes and relaxation of restrained stresses in concrete, it is of great importance to accurately consider these characteristics in the structural analysis and design process. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the creep under uniaxial compression and linear setting shrinkage of unsaturated polyester (UP) polymer concrete modified with three different levels of methyl methacrylic (MMA) monomer (i.e., 10, 20, and 30 wt.%).

An Integrated Optimization-Based Computational Framework for Progressive Collapse Analysis,Mohammadjavad Esfandiari,2020,Institution George Mason University,"This dissertation investigated progressive collapse analysis of three-dimensional (3D) reinforced concrete (RC) frames that are optimized for carrying structural loads by introducing a unique simultaneous multi-column removal load path.

MACROMECHANICAL ANALYSIS OF SPHERICALLY VOIDED BIAXIAL CONCRETE SLABS,"GIRUM URGESSA, WONDWOSEN ALI, JAVAD ESFANDIARI",2019,"Description The use of spherically voided biaxial concrete slab (SVBS) system, which uses hollow plastic balls as infill material, has increased widely because of its reduced weight-tostrength and weight-to-stiffness ratios when compared to solid concrete slabs. However, SVBS is a heterogeneous composite structure in which building a representative continuum model poses a significant challenge. To mitigate this challenge, the feasibility of determining the macromechanical structural behavior of spherically voided biaxial concrete slabs is studied using plate theories, aided by mechanical properties that were determined from a homogenization process of the representative volume element (RVE). This paper presents numerical analysis results of SVBS using both Mindlin-Reissner (thick) and Kirchhoff-Love (thin) plate theories. The results from both theories predicted the slab behavior reasonably well and they were within 10% of each other with the exception of the prediction of the twisting moment.

Finite Element Analyses of the Penetration Depth of Ogive-nosed Projectiles into Conventional and Very-High Strength Concrete Targets,"Girum Urgessa, Robert Sobeski",2019,"Description The objective of this paper is to present the development and assessment of finite element (FE) models used for analyzing projectile penetration depth in targets made from conventional (23 MPa) to very-high strength concretes (157 MPa). Results from the FE models were compared with experimental values. The effects of varying concrete compressive strength, projectile diameter, nose shape, and striking velocity on the penetration depth of the targets were captured. Two concrete constitutive material models, the Holmquist-Johnson-Cook and the Advanced Fundamental Concrete models, were implemented in the FE analyses for determining their suitability in predicting penetration mechanics with reasonable accuracy. In most cases, the finite element results were able to predict penetration depth experimental values within a total root mean square of 10% or less considering a wide-range of projectile striking velocities. Both concrete constitutive models were shown to be suitable for penetration mechanics problems. However, based on the findings of this paper, caution should be exercised in applying the material models for targets made from harder aggregates such as quartz.","The objective of this paper is to present the development and assessment of finite element (FE) models used for analyzing projectile penetration depth in targets made from conventional (23 MPa) to very-high strength concretes (157 MPa).

Automated Condition Assessment of Infrastructure Systems via 3D Computer Vision,Ali Khaloo,2018,Institution George Mason University,"Accurate condition assessment of in-service infrastructure systems is critical for system-wide prioritization decisions. Manual visual inspection is currently the main form of assessing the physical and functional conditions of civil infrastructure at regular intervals in order to ensure the infrastructure still meets its expected service requirements. During a routine inspection, qualified and trained inspectors visually observe and manually record their observations, a costly and time-consuming process that often results in subjective and variable final reports. Thus, making the inspection process less costly, less obtrusive, more quantitative, and more consistent is a major research need. In particular, there is a need for better methods of recording the visual representation of a structure at a given inspection interval, in order to create a more consistent and repeatable record of structural health.

Parametric Study of Slender and Dynamically Sensitive Buildings with Tuned Liquid Dampers Subject to Seismic Events,Musaddeque Hossein,2015/10/23,"Description Slender and dynamically sensitive buildings have insufficient inherent damping to mitigate harmful oscillations during seismic events and must use other means to increase damping. Passive damping methods such as Tuned Liquid Dampers (TLD) offer a low cost and effective means of damping. While several tower type buildings in the United States have utilized TLDs to mitigate wind induced oscillations, none have been used for reducing seismic induced oscillations. Currently there are no guidelines that allow the structural designer to design and evaluate the benefit and constructability of TLDs for mitigating structure response for a design seismic event.

Modelling impact sound reduction in floating wood floors,"Girum S Urgessa, Nouri Hacene-Djaballah",2009/9/1,Journal Wood Material Science and Engineering,"The transmission of footfall-excited impact sound is commonly reduced using floating wood floors.

For wood construction excited by transient load (e.g. footsteps), sound reduction estimations may contain uncertainties due to inadequate modelling of footsteps and floor components. This paper presents a multiple degree-of-freedom system model using Working Model 2D® (WM2D).

Floating Floor Attenuation of Impact Structure-borne Sound in Timber Construction,Nouri Hacene-Djaballah,2009/7/25,"Description The transmission of footfall-excited impact sound is commonly reduced using floating floors. The most basic of these constructions contains three layers – a resilient material, a load-bearing floor, and a floating slab. According to a literature review, a single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) vibration isolation model theoretically predicts impact sound reduction when assuming harmonic loading and a rigid load-bearing floor. However, for timber layers excited by transient loading (e.g. footsteps), sound reduction estimations may contain uncertainties due to inadequate modeling of footsteps and/or floor components. Therefore, this research presents a technique for modeling timber floating floors, as multiple degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, using the rigid body dynamics software Working Model 2D® (WM2D). WM2D is first used to verify the SDOF case, by comparing software-generated impact sound reduction plots to graphs found in the literature. Results show agreement between both sources, though with slight error in predicting resonance values. Next, an MDOF model is created with a transversely orthotropic and flexible timber load-bearing floor along with mechanical systems representing the footstep and resilient layer. The impact sound reduction graph for the MDOF system achieves higher values than the SDOF case, which can be attributed to additional resiliencies from flexible beams. Also, regions within the graph resemble the sound reduction plot for the SDOF case.","The transmission of footfall-excited impact sound is commonly reduced using floating floors.

Foi verificada a capacidade de revestimento de espuma de EPS (poliestireno expandido) atenuar o valor de pico de pressão refletida registrada em sensores piezoeléctricos. Foram realizadas análises estatísticas nos resultados de leitura de pressão refletida para verificar a atenuação gerada pela espuma. Os resultados apontaram redução de 38% do pico de pressão refletida experimental em comparação com a pressão refletida teórica esperada, na laje que recebeu revestimento de uma camada de 5 cm de EPS.",
Variação do Momento Linear de Lajes de Concreto Armado em Ensaios Experimentais com PBX,"Fausto Batista Mendonça¹, Girum Urgessa, Luiz Eduardo Nunes de Almeida, Koshun Iha, Roberta Jachura",CEP,Volume 12228,"Ameaças terroristas ou armamentos militares tem se tornado eventos comuns que podem gerar danos severos a estruturas e até ceifar vidas. As respostas das estruturas precisam ser entendidas para um correto dimensionamento. Este artigo apresenta resultados de ensaios experimentais com explosivos, comparando a variação do momento linear de lajes de concreto armado variando a massa de equivalente TNT e o peso das lajes. Três lajes de 50 MPa, e mesma taxa de armadura, foram sujeitas a explosivo plástico não confinados de peso similar. Uma das lajes foi revestida com 5 cm de espuma na face superior. Sensores registraram o deslocamento das lajes e o tempo de duração do movimento, a velocidade foi calculada com base nesses dados. Tendo o peso das lajes, calculou-se o momento linear. As comparações mostraram que variações de massa de equivalente TNT e do peso da laje seguiram a variação do momento linear. Entretanto, isso não ocorreu para a laje revestida com a espuma.",
Investigation of Reinforced Concrete Slabs Behavior Against Blast Varying Scaled Distance and Steel Reinforcement Ratios,"Fausto Batista Mendonça, Girum Solomon Urgessa, Koshun Iha, Roberta Jachura Rocha, José Atílio Fritz Fidel Rocco","I. INTRODUCTION: In a conflict scenario, reinforced concrete structures can guard important equipment of friendly forces or soldiers, or even protect civilians, and it is necessary to know the behavior of these structures when a blast wave is generated close to them [1]. The general aspects of explosives and explosion processes are essential to clarify the effects of explosives on buildings. This study aims to shed light on blast resistant building design theories, the enhancement of building security against the effects of explosives in both architectural and structural design processes and the design techniques that should be carried out [2]. Thus, a better understanding of explosives [3] and characteristics of explosions will enable structural engineers to make blast resistant building design much more efficient [4]. The objective of this study was to analyze the concepts of wave front of blast against reinforced concrete structures, using displacement meters. Reinforced concrete slabs with different values of static compressive strength, steel reinforcement ratio and under different scale distance were the targets. The slabs were subjected to non-confined PBX explosive and the sensors could register the displacement of the slab during the explosion. The collected data were analyzed by comparing the displacement results with literature [5],[6].","Scholar articles Investigation of Reinforced Concrete Slabs Behavior Against Blast Varying Scaled Distance and Steel Reinforcement RatiosFB Mendonça, GS Urgessa, K Iha, RJ Rocha…Related articles ","I.
