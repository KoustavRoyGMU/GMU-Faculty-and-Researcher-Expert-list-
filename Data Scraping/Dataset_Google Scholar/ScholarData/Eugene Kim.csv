Microbially synthesized repeats of mussel foot protein display enhanced underwater adhesion,"Eugene Kim, Bin Dai, James B Qiao, Wenlu Li, John D Fortner, Fuzhong Zhang",2018/11/27,Journal ACS applied materials & interfaces,"Mussels strongly adhere to a variety of surfaces by secreting byssal threads that contain mussel foot proteins (Mfps). Recombinant production of Mfps presents an attractive route for preparing advanced adhesive materials. Using synthetic biology strategies, we synthesized Mfp5 together with Mfp5 oligomers containing two or three consecutive, covalently-linked Mfp5 sequences named Mfp5(2) and Mfp5(3). The force and work of adhesion of these proteins were measured underwater with a colloidal probe mounted on an atomic force microscope and the adsorption was measured with a quartz crystal microbalance. We found positive correlations between Mfp5 molecular weight and underwater adhesive properties, including force of adhesion, work of adhesion, protein layer thickness, and recovery distance. DOPA-modified Mfp5(3) displayed a high force of adhesion (201 ± 36 nN μm–1) and a high work of adhesion …",27
A biosynthetic hybrid spidroin-amyloid-mussel foot protein for underwater adhesion on diverse surfaces,"Eugene Kim, Juya Jeon, Yaguang Zhu, Ethan D Hoppe, Young-Shin Jun, Guy M Genin, Fuzhong Zhang",2021/10/11,Journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces,"Strong underwater adhesives are attractive materials for biomedical healing and underwater repair, but their success in applications has been limited, owing to challenges with underwater setting and with balancing surface adhesion and cohesion. Here, we applied synthetic biology approaches to overcome these challenges through design and synthesis of a novel hybrid protein consisting of the zipper-forming domains of an amyloid protein, flexible spider silk sequences, and a dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-containing mussel foot protein (Mfp). This partially structured, hybrid protein can self-assemble into a semi-crystalline hydrogel that exhibits high strength and toughness as well as strong underwater adhesion to a variety of surfaces, including difficult-to-adhere plastics, tendon, and skin. The hydrogel allows selective debonding by oxidation or iron-chelating treatments. Both the material design and the …",7
Graphene oxide/mussel foot protein composites for high-strength and ultra-tough thin films,"Eugene Kim, Xuyan Qin, James B Qiao, Qingqing Zeng, John D Fortner, Fuzhong Zhang",2020/11/5,Journal Scientific reports,"Graphene oxide (GO)-based composite materials have become widely popular in many applications due to the attractive properties of GO, such as high strength and high electrical conductivity at the nanoscale. Most current GO composites use organic polymer as the matrix material and thus, their synthesis suffers from the use of organic solvents or surfactants, which raise environmental and energy-consumption concerns. Inspired by mussel foot proteins (Mfp) secreted by the saltwater mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis and by recent advances in microbial protein production, we developed an aqueous-based green synthesis strategy for preparing GO/Mfp film composites. These GO/Mfp films display high tensile strength (134–158 MPa), stretchability (~ 26% elongation), and high toughness (20–24 MJ/m3), beyond the capabilities of many existing GO composites. Renewable production of Mfp proteins and the facile …",3
Split intein mediated polymerization and production of mussel foot adhesive protein materials,"Fuzhong Zhang, Eugene Kim",2022/12/20,Patent office US,"Mussels strongly adhere to a variety of surfaces by secreting byssal threads that contain mussel foot proteins (Mfps). Recombinant production of Mfps presents an attractive route for preparing advanced adhesive materials. Using synthetic biology strategies, Mfp5 together with Mfp5 oligomers containing two or three consecutive, covalently-linked Mfp5 sequences (named Mfp5 2 and Mfp5 3) were synthesized. Positive correlations were found between Mfp5 molecular weight and underwater adhesive properties, including adhesion force, adhesion work, protein layer thickness, and recovery distance. Dopa-modified Mfp5 3 displayed a high adhesion force (201±36 nN μm− 1) and a high adhesion work (68±21 fJ μm− 1) for 200 s cure times, higher than previously reported Mfp-mimetic adhesives. Results disclosed herein highlight the power of synthetic biology in producing biocompatible and highly adhesive Mfp …",
