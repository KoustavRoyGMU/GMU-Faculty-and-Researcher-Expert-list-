Hydraulic conductivity of geosynthetic clay liners to low-level radioactive waste leachate,"Kuo Tian, Craig H Benson, William J Likos",2016/8/1,Journal Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering,"Hydraulic conductivity was evaluated for eight commercially available geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) permeated with leachate characteristic of low-level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal facilities operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Two of the GCLs (CS and GS) contained conventional sodium bentonite (Na-B). The others contained a bentonite–polymer mixture (CPL, CPH, GPL1, GPL2, and GPH) or bentonite–polymer composite (BPC). All GCLs (except GPL2 and GPH) were permeated directly with two synthetic LLW leachates that are essentially identical, except one has no radionuclides (nonradioactive synthetic leachate, or NSL) and the other has radionuclides (radioactive synthetic leachate, or RSL). Hydraulic conductivities to RSL and NSL were identical. For the CS and GS GCLs, the hydraulic conductivity gradually increased by a factor of 5–25 because divalent cations in the leachate replaced …",96
Polymer elution and hydraulic conductivity of bentonite–polymer composite geosynthetic clay liners,"Kuo Tian, William J Likos, Craig H Benson",2019/10/1,Journal Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering,Hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted on two commercially available bentonite–polymer composite (BPC) geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) containing the same dry blend of sodium bentonite (NaB) and polymer sandwiched between two nonwoven geotextiles (GTs) bound by needlepunching: a bentonite–polymer GCL (BP GCL) and bentonite–polymer GCL with silt film (BPS GCL). The GCLs were essentially identical except that the BPS GCL contained a woven slit-film GT to constrain polymer elution. The slit-film GT was located inside the GCL adjacent to the downstream nonwoven GT. The test liquids were deionized (DI) water and 20–500 mM  representing dilute to high-concentration permeant solutions. Effluent from the hydraulic conductivity tests was analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) to quantify polymer elution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to capture how the solution chemistry …,55
Effect of ammonium on the hydraulic conductivity of geosynthetic clay liners,"Melissa C Setz, Kuo Tian, Craig H Benson, Sabrina L Bradshaw",2017/12/1,Journal Geotextiles and Geomembranes,"Hydraulic conductivity and swell index tests were conducted on a conventional geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) containing sodium-bentonite (Na-B) using 5, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 mM ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) solutions to investigate how NH4+ accumulation in leachates in bioreactor and recirculation landfills may affect GCLs. Control tests were conducted with deionized (DI) water. Swell index of the Na-B was 27.7 mL/2 g in 5 mM NH4+ solution and decreased to 5.0 mL/2 g in 1000 mM NH4+ solution, whereas the swell index of Na-B in DI water was 28.0 mL/2 g. Hydraulic conductivity of the Na-B GCL to 5, 50, and 100 mM NH4+ was low, ranging from 1.6–5.9 × 10−11 m/s, which is comparable to the hydraulic conductivity to DI water (2.1 × 10−11 m/s). Hydraulic conductivities of the Na-B GCL permeated with 500 and 1000 mM NH4+ solutions were much higher (e.g., 1.6–5.2 × 10−6 m/s) due to suppression of …",44
Antioxidant depletion and service life prediction for HDPE geomembranes exposed to low-level radioactive waste leachate,"Kuo Tian, Craig H Benson, James M Tinjum, Tuncer B Edil",2017/6/1,Journal Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering,"Antioxidant depletion was evaluated in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane (GM) coupons immersed in radioactive synthetic leachate (RSL) representative of leachate in low-level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal facilities operated by the U.S. Department of Energy’s environmental restoration programs. Depletion was assessed at four temperatures (25, 50, 70, and 90°C). Comparative tests were conducted with nonradioactive synthetic leachate (NSL) having the same chemistry as RSL, except radionuclides were excluded. Control tests were conducted with deionized (DI) water. One-sided exposure tests were also conducted with the HDPE GM in RSL at 70 and 90°C. Specimens were removed periodically and tested to determine antioxidant depletion, melt flow index (MFI), crystallinity, and stress crack resistance.

Effect of an anion ratio on the hydraulic conductivity of a bentonite-polymer geosynthetic clay liner,"Kuo Tian, Craig H Benson, William J Likos",2017,Book Geotechnical Frontiers 2017,"Hydraulic conductivity and swell index tests were conducted on a commercially available geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) containing a dry-blended bentonite-polymer (B-P) mixture using solutions with a single monovalent cation (Na+) and varying anion ratio, R, defined as the molar concentration ratio of Cl- to SO42-. Na+ solutions with pure Cl- or SO42- and with anion ratios of 5 and 20 were used as permeant liquids. Swell index of the B-P in 300 mM Na+ solutions was independent of anion ratio (SI ≈ 22.5 mL/2 g for all solutions). However, hydraulic conductivity of the B-P GCL permeated with NaCl was approximately three orders of magnitude greater than the hydraulic conductivity to Na2SO4. Comparative tests were conducted on a conventional GCL with sodium-bentonite (Na-B) with 100 and 300 mM Na+ solutions with pure SO42- and pure Cl- as anions. Hydraulic conductivity of the Na-B GCL was unaffected …",27
Geochemical characteristics and toxic elements in alumina refining wastes and leachates from management facilities,"Chunwei Sun, Jiannan Chen, Kuo Tian, Daoping Peng, Xin Liao, Xiyong Wu",2019/4,Journal International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"A nationwide investigation was carried out to evaluate the geochemical characteristics and environmental impacts of red mud and leachates from the major alumina plants in China. The chemical and mineralogical compositions of red mud were investigated, and major, minor, and trace elements in the leachates were analyzed. The mineral and chemical compositions of red mud vary over refining processes (i.e., Bayer, sintering, and combined methods) and parental bauxites. The main minerals in the red mud are quartz, calcite, dolomite, hematite, hibschite, sodalite, anhydrite, cancrinite, and gibbsite. The major chemical compositions of red mud are Al, Fe, Si, Ca, Ti, and hydroxides. The associated red mud leachate is hyperalkaline (pH > 12), which can be toxic to aquatic life. The concentrations of Al, Cl−, F−, Na, NO32−, and SO42− in the leachate exceed the recommended groundwater quality standard of China by up to 6637 times. These ions are likely to increase the salinization of the soil and groundwater. The minor elements in red mud leachate include As, B, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn, Mo, Ti, V, and Zn, and the trace elements in red mud leachate include Ag, Be, Cd, Co, Hg, Li, Pb, Sb, Se, Sr, and Tl. Some of these elements have the concentration up to 272 times higher than those of the groundwater quality standard and are toxic to the environment and human health. Therefore, scientific guidance is needed for red mud management, especially for the design of the containment system of the facilities.",26
Pore-scale imaging of polymer-modified bentonite in saline solutions,"Kuo Tian, William J Likos, Craig H Benson",2016,Book Geo-Chicago 2016,"Bentonite-polymer mixtures (B-P) used in geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) have been shown to maintain low hydraulic conductivity in aggressive (e.g., high ionic strength) permeant solutions detrimental to untreated sodium-bentonite (Na-B). While a number of hypotheses have been proposed, the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms for improved chemical compatibility and low hydraulic conductivity of B-P GCL remain poorly understood. This paper describes a suite of scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) analyses conducted to observe pore-scale structure of B-P hydrated with deionized water and saline solutions. Polymer observed in B-P exposed to deionized water had a remnant three-dimensional network structure, with polymer chains forming bridges among clay clusters and filling large voids in the inter-cluster pore space. Polymer observed in specimens exposed to 20 and 200 mM CaCl2 …",22
Effect of specimen preparation on the swell index of bentonite-polymer GCLs,"Christian Wireko, Binte Zainab, Kuo Tian, Tarek Abichou",2020/12/1,Journal Geotextiles and Geomembranes,"Experiments were conducted to investigate how specimen preparation (crushing and sieving) affects the swell index (SI) of bentonite-polymer (B–P) composites and the relationship between SI and hydraulic conductivity of B–P GCLs. Seven B–P and one Na–B GCLs were used in this study. Tests were conducted using DI water and synthetic municipal solid waste incineration ash leachates. Specimens were prepared using the ASTM D5890 and two alternative methods prior to SI testing. For both Na–B and B–P composites, <100% of the specimen passed through the #100 sieve regardless of the amount of crushing performed using a mortar and pestle. SIs and loss on ignitions (LOI) of the portion of the B–P composites passing #100 sieve were comparable to the Na–B, whereas the B–P specimen retained on #100 sieve had very high SIs and LOIs. These observations indicate that crushing and sieving of the B–P …",16
Radiation dose and antioxidant depletion in a HDPE geomembrane,"Kuo Tian, Craig H Benson, Youming Yang, James M Tinjum",2018/8/1,Journal Geotextiles and Geomembranes,"The impact of α and β radiation on antioxidant depletion in smooth high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes (GMs) is described. Smooth HDPE GMs having different thickness (0.04-mm, 0.1-mm, 0.2-mm) were created by mechanically pulverizing sections of 2-mm-thick smooth HDPE GM and extruding the polymer at different thicknesses using a film blowing machine. The 2-mm-thick smooth HDPE GM was also used in the experiments. HDPE GM specimens were exposed to sealed sources of 241Am and 99Tc for 1–50 h to simulate the impact of α and β radiation from U and 99Tc in low-level radioactive waste (LLW) leachate. Standard oxidative induction time (OIT) tests were conducted to determine antioxidant depletion. No change in OIT occurred in the 2-mm-thick HDPE GM after exposure to sealed sources of 241Am and 99Tc for 50 h. In much thinner GMs (e.g., 0.04 mm), however, significant …",16
Hydraulic conductivity of bentonite-polymer geosynthetic clay liners to coal combustion product leachates,"Binte Zainab, Christian Wireko, Dong Li, Kuo Tian, Tarek Abichou",2021/10/1,Journal Geotextiles and Geomembranes,"Hydraulic conductivity of seven geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) to synthetic coal combustion product (CCP) leachates were evaluated in this study. The leachates are chemically representative of typical and worst scenarios observed in CCP landfills. The ionic strength (I) of the synthetic CCP leachates ranged from 50 mM to 4676 mM (TCCP-50, LRMD-96, TFGDS-473, LR-2577, HI-3179 and HR-4676). One of the GCLs contained conventional sodium bentonite (Na–B) and the other six contained bentonite-polymer (B–P) mixture with polymer loadings ranging from 0.5% to 12.7%. Hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted at an effective confining stress of 20 kPa. The hydraulic conductivity of the Na–B GCLs were >1 × 10−10 m/s when permeated with all six CCP leachates, whereas the B–P GCLs with sufficient polymer loading maintained low hydraulic conductivity to synthetic CCP leachates.

Effect of polymer amendment on hydraulic conductivity of bentonite in calcium chloride solutions,"Yan-Jun Du, Sheng-Qiang Shen, Kuo Tian, Yu-Ling Yang",2021/2/1,Journal Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering,"Hydraulic conductivity of polyanionic cellulose (PAC)–amended bentonite (PB) in calcium chloride () solutions was investigated to access its chemical compatibility in vertical cutoff walls application. PB was synthesized by mixing conventional bentonite (CB) powder with PAC (2% dry weight). The specific gravity (), liquid limit (), pH, swell index (SI), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of CB and PB were measured, and hydraulic conductivities and microstructures of the PB and CB filter cakes were evaluated by performing modified fluid loss (MFL) tests and scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analyses, respectively. The results showed that PB had higher , SI, and CEC but lower  and pH than CB; in particular, PB possessed higher SI in  solution as compared to CB.

Containing bauxite liquor using bentonite-polymer composite geosynthetic clay liners,"Kuo Tian, Craig H Benson",2019,Conference Proceedings of the 8th International Congress on Environmental Geotechnics Volume 2: Towards a Sustainable Geoenvironment 8th," Experiments were conducted to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) to bauxite liquor from aluminum refining. Tests were conducted with a GCL containing conventional sodium-bentonite (Na-B) and one GCLs containing a bentonite-polymer composite. B-P has polymer loading of 6.8%. Hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted on the GCLs with bauxite liquor in flexible-wall permeameters following procedures in ASTM D6766. The bauxite liquor used in the experiments has pH 13 and ionic strength = 700 mM. Hydraulic conductivity of the Na-B GCL increased to approximately 10−7 m/s during permeation, whereas the B-P GCL maintained low hydraulic conductivity (~ 4.3 × 10−12 m/s). Suppression of bentonite swelling by the bauxite liquor is the primary factor responsible for the higher hydraulic conductivity of the Na-B GCL. Low hydraulic conductivity of the B-P …",15

Constituents in the leachates are categorized into four groups: inorganic macrocomponents, metals and metalloids (e.g., Cu, Fe, and Zn), radionuclides, and organic compounds. The leachates are circumneutral (pH from 5.7 to 9.1) and generally oxidizing (redox potential, Eh, ranging from  to 344 mV, averaging from 72 to 144.5 mV at each of the four facilities). Ionic strength of the leachate ranges from 2.15 to 135.86 mM.

Chemical compatibility of geosynthetic clay liners to aggressive bauxite liquor,"Kuo Tian, Craig H Benson",2017,Journal Proceedings of 35th international ICSOBA conference,"Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of an aggressive bauxite liquor on the hydraulic conductivity of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) used for composite liners in disposal facilities for red mud from aluminum refining. Tests were conducted on two sodium-bentonite (Na-B) GCL and one bentonite-polymer (BP) composite GCL. The Na-B GCLs contained powdered or granular bentonite. The BP GCL contained a mixture of granular NaB and dry water-soluble polymer. All GCLs were prehydrated to 100% water content with a 2500 mg/L NaCl solution prior to permeation. The Na-B GCL with granular bentonite was permeable to bauxite liquor (5.0 x10-10 m/s), whereas the Na-B GCL with powdered bentonite maintained low hydraulic conductivity (1.8 x10-11 m/s). Hydraulic conductivity of the BP GCL was very low initially (1x10-12 m/s), but increased over time to 1.3 x10-10 m/s as polymer was eluted from the pore space. Clogging of fine pores by precipitates is hypothesized as the mechanism for the low hydraulic conductivity of the Na-B GCL with powdered bentonite. The findings indicate that GCLs used for composite liners in disposal facilities for residuals from aluminum refining can have very different hydraulic conductivity depending on the characteristics of the bentonite or bentonite-polymer mixture in the GCL. Construction specifications should ensure that the GCL that is installed is chemically compatible with the liquid to be contained.",6
Long-term performance of geosynthetic liner materials in low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities,Kuo Tian,2015,Institution The University of Wisconsin-Madison,"Low-level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal facilities employ geosynthetic liner materials [eg, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane (GM) and geosynthetic clay liner (GCL)] in multilayer barrier systems to control the flux of contaminants into the environment. Long-term durability of geosynthetics in contact with LLW leachate is of particular importance because the design life of LLW barrier systems is commonly 1000 yr.",5

The BPC GCLs contained a dry blend of bentonite and proprietary polymers and had polymer loading ranging from 0.5 to 5.5%. The polymers used in the BPC GCLs were classified as linear polymer (LP) or crosslinked polymer (CP) based on the swelling characteristics of specimens extracted from the GCLs. Comparable hydraulic conductivity tests were also performed on two conventional bentonite (CB) GCLs as controls.

Antioxidant depletion in HDPE geomembranes exposed to low-level radioactive waste leachate,"Kuo Tian, James M Tinjum, Craig H Benson, Tuncer B Edil",2014,Book Geo-Congress 2014: Geo-characterization and Modeling for Sustainability,"Low-level radioactive waste (LLW) and mixed waste (MW) disposal facilities in the United States are required to have a service life in excess of 1000 yr. Understanding the rate of degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes used in LLW and MW facilities is necessary to assess their service life. HDPE geomembranes (GM) undergo degradation in three stages: antioxidant depletion (Stage I), induction time to the onset of polymer degradation (Stage II), and polymer property degradation (Stage III). This paper focuses on antioxidant depletion in LLW leachate. HDPE geomembrane coupons (2-mm thick) were immersed in radioactive synthetic leachate (RSL) with chemistry representative of leachate in LLW disposal facilities operated by the U.S. Department of Energy's environmental restoration programs.

Effect of effective stress on hydraulic conductivity of bentonite–polymer geosynthetic clay liners to coal combustion product leachates,"Dong Li, Binte Zainab, Kuo Tian",2021/11,Journal Environmental Geotechnics,"Experiments were conducted to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity of five geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) permeated with four synthetic coal combustion product (CCP) leachates (ionic strength = 473–4676 mM).

Lithium extraction to determine ammonium in the exchange complex of bentonite,"Melissa C Setz, Craig H Benson, Sabrina L Bradshaw, Kuo Tian",2018/8/16,Journal Geotechnical Testing Journal,"ASTM D7503, Standard Test Method for Measuring the Exchange Complex and Cation Exchange Capacity of Inorganic Fine-Grained Soils, is used to determine soluble and bound cation concentrations as well as the cation exchange capacity of fine-grained soils used in barrier systems for waste containment, including bentonite in geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs). ASTM D7503 prescribes the use of 1 M ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) as an extraction liquid for bound cations, which masks ammonium (NH4+) that may be in the exchange complex in bentonite in contact with municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate. A 1 M lithium bromide (LiBr) extraction liquid is proposed as an alternative to the 1 M NH4OAc in ASTM D7503 so that NH4+ in the exchange complex can be quantified without interfering with measurement of other bound cations of interest for waste containment. Nearly the same distribution of bound major cations was obtained using the method in ASTM D7503 and the proposed alternative using 1 M LiBr for two bentonites from two new GCLs (not permeated). Using the 1 M LiBr method revealed substantial NH4+ bound to eight bentonites obtained from GCLs that had been permeated with different MSW leachates. The bound NH4+ concentration varied directly with NH4+ concentration in the leachates, and this variance explained a charge imbalance obtained from tests conducted on the bentonites using the standard method in ASTM D7503.",1
Radon Fluxes from an Earthen Barrier Over Uranium Mill Tailings After Two Decades of Service-17234,"Craig H Benson, William H Albright, Mark Fuhrmann, William J Likos, Nicolas Stefani, Kuo Tian, W Joseph Waugh, Morgan M Williams",2017/3/5,Journal Waste Management Conference,"Radon (Rn) fluxes were measured at a disposal facility for uranium mill tailings after two decades of service. The facility was closed with an earthen cover vegetated with grasses. Measurements were made on the surface of the Rn barrier and directly on the surface of the tailings. Fluxes were measured using extra small (area= 0.018 m2), small (0.071 m2), medium (0.59 m2), and large (2.32 m2) flux chambers to evaluate the impact of measurement scale on Rn flux. Activated carbon (AC) passive collectors and electric radon detectors (RAD7) were used to measure Rn concentrations. Tests were conducted at various locations on each cover representing conditions that can lead to different levels of soil structural development and different water content. Rn fluxes at the surface of the Rn barrier were much lower than Rn fluxes measured at the surface of the tailings, indicating the barrier remained effective for Rn containment. Geometric mean Rn fluxes measured at the surface of the Rn barrier in each test pit were below the regulatory requirement (0.74 Bq/m2-s). Rn concentrations measured using AC samplers in the flux chambers were 60% of concentrations measured using the RAD7, on average, and Rn fluxes computed with the AC data were 9% of those computed with the RAD7 data, on average. Size of the flux chamber had no systematic effect on Rn flux, indicating that 20 y of soil forming processes had not created a pore network causing scale-dependent Rn flux. Geometric mean Rn fluxes in the test pits were similar regardless of differences in surface conditions (vegetation, thickness of soil cover) known to influence soil forming processes …",1
Hydraulic conductivity of GCL overlap permeated with saline solutions,"Jackeline Gastelo, Dong Li, Kuo Tian, Burak F Tanyu, F Erol Guler",2023/2/15,Source Waste Management,"Hydraulic conductivity of the overlap region of two needle-punched sodium bentonite (Na-B) geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) permeated with CaCl2 solutions under confining stresses of 20, 100, 250, and 500 kPa were evaluated. One of the GCLs consisted of a uniform layer of Na-B encapsulated between a nonwoven (NW) and a woven (W) geotextile, and the other one consisted of NW geotextiles on both sides. Supplemental bentonite was placed within the overlap region. Experiments were conducted with 10, 20, and 50 mM CaCl2 solutions representing dilute and aggressive leachates. The results indicate that in most of the scenarios there is a possibility that the flow is not completely vertical (meaning flow passes through the overlap region horizontally).

Evaluation of Atactic Polypropylene (APP) geomembranes used as liners for salt ponds,"Sandarva M Sharma, Kuo Tian, Burak Tanyu",2023/2/1,Journal Geotextiles and Geomembranes,"This study focused on evaluating the longevity of Atactic Polypropylene (APP) used as a geomembrane (GM) to line ponds that collect runoff water from salt handling facilities. Samples of APP were exhumed from the ponds that have been in service for 6-, 25-, and 44-years and evaluated in the laboratory. Tests were conducted to analyze the surface cracks and textures, tensile properties, puncture resistance, and ability to hold water (permeability). Control tests were conducted with virgin APP GM. Results were compared based on the difference in the age of the APP, location of where the APP samples were obtained within the side slope of the pond (i.e., submerged, and above water level), and orientation of the side slope in relation to the sun (e.g., east, west, north, or south).

Stress-induced pore water pressures in the vadose zone beneath a composite-lined landfill,"Craig H Benson, Jiannan Chen, Kuo Tian",2021/10/12,Journal Japanese Geotechnical Society Special Publication,"A finite-element model was developed to evaluate mechanisms contributing to positive pore pressures measured with sealed pressure transducers in the geological buffer beneath the Environmental Management Waste Management Facility (EMWMF), a composite-lined mixed waste disposal facility operated by the US Department of Energy. The geological buffer is a 3-m-thick engineered fine-textured layer directly beneath the EMWMF’s composite liner, and above the groundwater table. The model accounts for changes in pore water pressure resulting from (i) moistening of the geological buffer due to equilibration with the underlying geological materials,(ii) loading imposed by waste placed on the overlying liner, and (iii) fluctuations in the elevation of the underlying groundwater table. Pore water pressures predicted by the model are in good agreement with pore water pressures measured in the field. The predictions confirm that positive pore water pressures recorded by the sealed pressure transducers in the geological buffer are excess pore water pressures induced by the vertical normal stress imposed by waste placed on the liner, and are not due to a rise in the groundwater table. Simulations also showed that two additional years of filling would further increase the pore water pressure without any change in elevation of the groundwater table. The geological buffer remained unsaturated during the simulation, with a Bw-coefficient similar to that computed from the field-measured pore water pressures and waste filling records. Larger increases in pore water pressure were observed when the geological buffer was assumed to have higher …",
Chemical Compatibility of Conventional Geo-synthetic Clay Liners to Aggressive Low-Level Radioactive Waste Leachate-17296,"Kuo Tian, Craig H Benson",2017/7/1,Issue INIS-US-19-WM-17296,"representative of leachates in low-level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal facilities affected the hydraulic conductivity of a conventional sodium-bentonite (Na-B) geo-synthetic clay liner (GCL) used in composite liner systems. One leachate was highly alkaline (H-pH) and the other had a low abundance of monovalent cations relative to divalent cations (L-RMD). Tests were also conducted with a typical radioactive synthetic leachate (RSL) and with deionized (DI) water as control. Na-B from the GCL had a swell index of 24 mL/2 g in RSL, 22 mL/2 g in H-pH leachate, and 16 mL/2 g in L-RMD leachate, whereas the swell index was 36 mL/2 g in DI water. Hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted in flexible-wall permeameters using the falling headwater with an effective confining stress at 20 kPa. Hydraulic conductivity of Na-B GCL was low when permeated with RSL (1.8 x 10-10 m/s) and H-pH leachate (2.4 x 10{sup -10} m/s), but higher than the hydraulic conductivity to DI water (2.5 x10{sup -11} m/s). The GCL was two orders of magnitude more permeable when permeated with L-RMD leachate (7.9 x 10{sup -8} m/s). The higher hydraulic conductivity of the GCL to the leachates is attributed to reduced swelling of the Na-B in leachates with higher ionic strength solution (H-pH, RSL) or a predominance of divalent cations (L-RMD). Increasing the effective confining stress from 20 to 450 kPa reduced the hydraulic conductivity approximately two orders of magnitude for the L-RMD and H-pH leachates. (authors)",
Effect of Radiation from Low-Level Radioactive Waste Leachate on Antioxidant Depletion in HDPE Geomembrane–16087,"Kuo Tian, Craig Benson, Youming Yang, James Tinjum",2016/7/1,Issue INIS-US-19-WM-16087,"Low-level radioactive waste (LLW) and mixed waste (MW) disposal facilities in the US are required to have a service life in excess of 1000 yr. Understanding the rate of degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes (GMs) used in LLW and MW facilities is necessary to assess their service life when conducting a performance assessment for a disposal facility. In LLW and MW disposal facilities, GMs may be exposed to radionuclides that may accelerate antioxidant depletion and degradation. This paper evaluates how radiation dosage affects antioxidant depletion in HDPE GMs and makes inferences regarding the impact of radiation on GM service life. Specimens of 0.04-mm-, 0.1-mm-, and 2-mm-thick HDPE GMs were exposed to a sealed source of Am-241 to simulate alpha radiation from LLW leachate (eg, uranium). The specimens were exposed to the sealed source for 1–50 h, followed by oxidative induction time (OIT) testing to determine depletion of antioxidants in response to exposure. Penetration of alpha particles in the HDPE GM exposed to the sealed source was evaluated with the program GEometry ANd Tracking (GEANT4). The GEANT4 modeling indicates that physical dose deposition for alpha particles largely occurs on the superficial layers and decreased monotonically with depth to a negligible dose (~ 28 µm). For a 2-mm-thick HDPE GM, there was no change in OIT after exposure, whereas in much thinner GMs (eg, 0.04 mm), significant antioxidant depletion occurred after exposure, reflecting the shallow penetration of alpha radiation at the surface of HDPE GM.",
Effect of Low-Level Radioactive Waste Leachate on Antioxidant Depletion in HDPE Geomembranes–15135,"Kuo Tian, Youming Yang, Craig H Benson, James M Tinjum",2015/7/1,Issue INIS-US-19-WM-15135,"Low-level radioactive waste (LLW) and mixed waste (MW) disposal facilities in the US are required to have a service life in excess of 1000 yr. Understanding the rate of degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes (GMs) used in barriers of LLW and MW facilities is necessary to assess their service life. HDPE GMs undergo degradation in three stages: antioxidant depletion (Stage I), induction time (stage II), and polymer degradation (Stage III). For LLW and MW facilities, these degradation mechanisms must be assessed with the GM in contact with leachates representative of LLW or MW. This paper focuses on antioxidant depletion in LLW leachate. HDPE GM coupons (2-mm thick) were immersed in radioactive synthetic leachate (RSL) with chemistry representative of leachate in LLW disposal facilities operated by the US Department of Energy’s environmental restoration programs. Depletion was assessed at four temperatures (25, 50, 70, and 90 C). Comparative tests were conducted with non-radioactive synthetic leachate (NSL), which has the same chemistry as RSL except radionuclides are excluded. Control tests were conducted with deionized (DI) water. Specimens were removed periodically and tested to determine their mechanical and chemical properties. Antioxidant depletion was measured by both standard and high-pressure oxidative induction time (OIT) tests. The rate of antioxidant depletion in RSL is statistically no different than depletion in NSL. Extrapolating the laboratory data at elevated temperatures to a typical LLW liner at 15 oC via Arrhenius modeling showed that the time for antioxidant depletion for a GM …",
Effects of Prehydration on Hydraulic Conductivity of Bentonite-Polymer Geosynthetic Clay Liner to Coal Combustion Product Leachate,"Dong Li, Kuo Tian",Geo-Congress 2022,Pages 568-577,"Experiments were conducted to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity of non-prehydrated and prehydrated geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) to coal combustion product (CCP) leachate. One commercially available bentonite-polymer (B-P) GCL with polymer loading of 3.8% (B-P-3.8) and one sodium-bentonite (Na-B) GCL were tested in this study. Hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted with Na-B and B-P-3.8 GCLs to one synthetic CCP leachate directly, which was chemically representative of the CCP leachate with high-ionic (HI) strength (ionic strength = 3179 mM). Comparative tests were conducted with the same GCL specimens prehydated with neutral or alkaline prehydration solutions until hydraulic equilibrium before permeated with HI leachate to determine the beneficial effect of prehydration. Hydraulic conductivity of Na-B GCLs prehydrated with synthetic solutions (pH = 6.8 and pH = 12) to HI leachate were …",

"Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA 22030","Jiannan Chen, Craig H Benson, Kuo Tian","A finite-element model was developed to evaluate mechanisms contributing to positive pore pressures measured with sealed pressure transducers in the geological buffer beneath the Environmental Management Waste Management Facility, a composite-lined mixed waste disposal facility operated by the US Department of Energy. The geological buffer is a 3-m-thick engineered finetextured layer directly beneath the Environmental Management Waste Management Facility’s composite liner, and above the groundwater table. The model accounts for changes in pore water pressure resulting from (i) loading imposed by waste placed on the overlying liner,(ii) moistening of the geological buffer due to equilibration with the underlying geological materials, and (iii) fluctuations in the elevation of the underlying groundwater table. Pore water pressures predicted by the model are in good agreement with pore water pressures measured in the field. The predictions confirm that positive pore water pressures recorded by the sealed pressure transducers in the geological buffer are excess pore water pressures induced by the vertical normal stress imposed by waste placed on the liner, and are not due to a rise in the groundwater table. Simulations also showed that two additional years of filling would further increase the pore water pressure without any change in elevation of the groundwater table.

Hydraulic Conductivity of Geosynthetic Clay Liners to Low-Level Radioactive Waste Leachate–14082,"Kuo Tian, Craig H Benson","Experiments were conducted to evaluate how permeation with leachate from lowlevel radioactive waste (LLW) disposal facilities affects the hydraulic conductivity of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) used in composite liner systems. Five commercially available GCLs were evaluated. Two of the GCLs contained conventional sodium (Na) bentonite (C1 and C2) and the others contained polymer-modified bentonite (R1, R2, BPC). The BPC GCL contains a bentonitepolymer composite, whereas the R1 and R2 GCLs contain a dry mixture of polymer and conventional Na bentonite. The GCLs were hydrated and permeated with two synthetic leachates that are chemically identical, except one leachate is prepared without radionuclides (non-radioactive synthetic leachate, or NSL) and the other with radionuclides (radioactive synthetic leachate, or RSL). Control tests were conducted with deionized (DI) water. For the C1, C2, R1, and R2 GCLs, the hydraulic conductivity gradually increased during permeation with synthetic LLW leachate, with final hydraulic conductivities ranging from 1.3 x10-10 to 5.6 x10-10 m/s at 20 kPa effective stress. In contrast, the hydraulic conductivity of these GCLs to DI water ranged from 7.6 x10-12 to 3.1 x10-11 m/s. The R1 and R2 GCLs, containing a dry mixture of polymer and bentonite, were no more resistant to increases in hydraulic conductivity due to permeation by leachate than conventional Na bentonites, and the largest increases in hydraulic conductivity were obtained with the R1 GCL. In contrast, hydraulic conductivity of the BPC GCL was very low to both LLW leachates (≈ 6x10-12 to 8x10-12 m/s) and DI water.
