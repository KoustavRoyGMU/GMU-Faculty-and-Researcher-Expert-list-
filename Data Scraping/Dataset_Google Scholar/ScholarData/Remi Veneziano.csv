Here, we display the clinical vaccine immunogen eOD-GT8, an engineered outer domain of the HIV-1 glycoprotein-120, on DNA origami nanoparticles to systematically interrogate the impact of these nanoscale parameters on B-cell activation in vitro. We find that B-cell signalling is maximized by as few as five antigens maximally spaced on the surface of a 40-nm viral-like nanoparticle. Increasing antigen spacing up to ~25–30 nm monotonically increases B-cell receptor activation. Moreover, scaffold rigidity is essential for robust B-cell triggering.

CyaA invades target cells by translocating its catalytic domain directly across the plasma membrane and overproduces cAMP, leading to cell death. The molecular process leading to the translocation of the catalytic domain remains largely unknown. We have previously shown that the catalytic domain per se, AC384, encompassing residues 1–384 of CyaA, did not interact with lipid bilayer, whereas a longer polypeptide, AC489, spanning residues 1–489, binds to membranes and permeabilizes vesicles.

However, the dependence of the photophysics of the superradiant exciton on the underlying DNA template length and the impact of static disorder on energy transfer through these PIC J-aggregates remain unknown. We examine the delocalization length progression of superradiant PIC excitons by varying the length of poly-A DNA tracts that template PIC J-aggregates.

Our model toxin, the adenylate cyclase (CyaA) from Bordetella pertussis, is able to invade eukaryotic cells by translocating its catalytic domain directly across the plasma membrane of target cells. To characterize its original translocation process, we designed an in vitro assay based on a biomimetic membrane model in which a tethered lipid bilayer (tBLM) is assembled on an amine-gold surface derivatized with calmodulin (CaM).

These highly programmable nanoarchitectures are assembled into any shape or size with nanoscale precision by folding a single-stranded DNA scaffold with short complementary oligonucleotides. The standard scaffold strand used to fold DNA origami nanocarriers is usually the M13mp18 bacteriophage’s circular single-stranded DNA genome with limited design flexibility in terms of the sequence and size of the final objects. However, with the recent progress in automated DNA origami design—allowing for increasing structural complexity—and the growing number of applications, the need for scalable methods to produce custom scaffolds has become crucial to overcome the limitations of traditional methods for scaffold production. Improved scaffold synthesis strategies will help to broaden the use of DNA origami for more biomedical applications.

The spectral properties of fluorophores used in conventional microscopy limit the number of measured proteins to four species within a given sample. The ability to perform high-throughput confocal or super-resolution imaging of many proteins simultaneously without limitation in target number imposed by this spectral limit would enable large-scale characterization of synaptic protein networks in situ. Here, we introduce PRISM: Probe-based Imaging for Sequential Multiplexing, a method that sequentially utilizes either high affinity Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) or low affinity DNA probes to enable diffraction-limited confocal and PAINT-based super-resolution imaging. High-affinity LNA probes offer high-throughput, confocal-based imaging compared with PAINT, which uses low affinity probes to realize localization-based super-resolution imaging. Simultaneous immunostaining of all targets is performed prior to imaging, followed by sequential LNA/DNA probe exchange that requires only minutes under mild wash conditions. We apply PRISM to quantify the co-expression levels and nanometer-scale organization of one dozen cytoskeletal and synaptic proteins within individual neuronal synapses.

Implementing single particle tracking to extract force–displacement curves enables the measurement of DNA origami stiffness values at the enthalpic elasticity regime, i.e. for forces larger than 15 pN. Comparisons between ligated and nicked helices show that the latter exhibit nearly a two-fold decrease in axial stiffness.

A Microfluidic Platform to Monitor Real-Time Effects of Extracellular Vesicle Exchange between Co-Cultured Cells across Selectively Permeable Barriers,"Hunter G Mason, Joshua Bush, Nitin Agrawal, Ramin M Hakami, Remi Veneziano",2022/3/24,Journal International Journal of Molecular Sciences,"Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a significant yet poorly understood role in cell–cell communication during homeostasis and various pathological conditions. Conventional in vitro and in vivo approaches for studying exosome/EV function depend on time-consuming and expensive vesicle purification methods to obtain sufficient vesicle populations. Moreover, the existence of various EV subtypes with distinct functional characteristics and submicron size makes their analysis challenging. To help address these challenges, we present here a unique chip-based approach for real-time monitoring of cellular EV exchange between physically separated cell populations. The extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking Matrigel is used to physically separate cell populations confined within microchannels, and mimics tissue environments to enable direct study of exosome/EV function. The submicron effective pore size of the Matrigel allows for the selective diffusion of only exosomes and other smaller EVs, in addition to soluble factors, between co-cultured cell populations. Furthermore, the use of PEGDA hydrogel with a very small pore size of 1.2 nm in lieu of Matrigel allows us to block EV migration and, therefore, differentiate EV effects from effects that may be mediated by soluble factors. This versatile platform bridges purely in vitro and in vivo assays by enabling studies of EV-mediated cellular crosstalk under physiologically relevant conditions, enabling future exosome/EV investigations across multiple disciplines through real-time monitoring of vesicle exchange.",3

A DNA-Based Building Block for Designer Excitonic Circuits,"Etienne Boulais, Nicolas Sawaya, Rémi Veneziano, Alessio Andreoni, Su Lin, Neal Woodbury, Hao Yan, Alan Aspuru-Guzik, Mark Bathe",2016/2/16,Journal Biophysical Journal,"Mimicking the ability of natural light harvesting systems to absorb and transport energy efficiently over long ranges is an important unmet challenge in bionanotechnology. Structured biomolecular scaffolds such as DNA assemblies offer exquisite control over 3D nanometer-scale chromophore organization to program custom energy transfer pathways at the nanoscale while exploiting the quantum nature of inter-molecular chromophore coupling. Here, we report a bottom-up multi-chromophore design framework that leverages quantum properties to design modular, customizable excitonic circuits using programmed DNA assemblies. To achieve this we employ sequence-specific DNA scaffolds that organize strongly interacting cyanine aggregates as building blocks to construct fast, coherent energy transfer in complex supramolecular architectures. Using this approach, we synthesized a DX-tile that consists of …",1

Here, we report initial evidence of a new type of PIC aggregate, formed through heterogeneous nucleation on DNA oligonucleotides, displaying photophysical properties that differ significantly from previously reported aggregates. This new aggregate, which we call the super aggregate (SA) due to the need for elevated dye excess to form it, is clearly differentiated from previously reported aggregates by spectroscopic and biophysical characterization. In emission spectra, the SA exhibits peak narrowing and, in some cases, significant quantum yield variation, indicative of stronger coupling in cyanine dyes.

New hybrid molecular modalities comprised of DNA-origami and interfering peptides as inhibitors of protein-protein interactions,"Jessica Roman, Rachel Carter, Alessandra Luchini, Lance Liotta, Remi Veneziano, Amanda Haymond",2022/6/15,Journal Cancer Research,"Immunotherapy has shown tremendous promise in the treatment of blood cancers; however, treatment typically fails when attempted with solid tumors, such as breast cancer. However, the cases where immunotherapies have been successful in breast cancer, the results have been remarkable: full remission of stage 4 disease has been observed. This highlights the need to elucidate how the tumor microenvironment (TME) fosters a context of molecular crosstalk that is hostile to inflammatory, anti-tumor immunological responses that present a significant roadblock to consistently successful immunotherapy. Aberrant IL-33 present in the TME is believed to be one of these major factors that drives tumor progression via its ligand, ST2, and the subsequent recruitment of IL1RAcP.

Amongst these antigens, eOD-GT8 engineered from the envelope glycoprotein gp120 has been previously reported to be highly immunogenic only when presented in a multimeric form. B-cell activation is initiated upon engagement of cell membrane expressed B-cell receptors (BCR) by antigens. Although the intracellular signaling cascade following antigen binding is well understood, very little is known about the early events of recognition and binding of antigens by the BCR. In particular, the importance of antigen nanoscale organization and valency remain not well understood even though these parameters may be critical for the development of a successful vaccine.

The CyaA toxin is able to invade eukaryotic cells by translocating its N-terminal catalytic domain directly across the plasma membrane of the target cells where, activated by endogenous calmodulin, it produces supraphysiological levels of cAMP. The molecular process leading to the translocation of the catalytic domain across the plasma membrane remains poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the membrane interacting properties of the CyaA catalytic domain by a combination of biophysical approaches.

Super-resolution fluorescence imaging is a powerful approach to resolving nanometer-scale organization of synapse molecules. However, conventional super-resolution imaging is limited to simultaneous interrogation of only 2-4 proteins in a single synapse. As an alternative, here we apply DNA …",

SPR was used to monitor the membrane interaction of the CyaA toxin, while the activation of the catalytic activity of CyaA by the tethered CaM was used as a probe of its translocation across the bilayer. Translocation of the CyaA catalytic domain was found to be strictly dependent upon the presence of calcium, and upon application of a negative trans-membrane potential, in good agreement with prior studies done on eukaryotic cells. These results demonstrate that CyaA does not require any eukaryotic components to translocate across a membrane, and suggest that CyaA is electrophoretically transported across the bilayer by the transmembrane electrical field.

Dans ce but, deux approches sont adoptées: l'une mettant en œuvre une plateforme basée sur des nanoparticules de silice/Au recouvertes de lipides et l'autre comprenant la formation de bicouches lipidiques découplées d'un support solide d'or. Dans la première approche, nous avons synthétisé des particules de silice de taille nanométrique contenant des grains d'or inclus dans la matrice silicique. Ces nanoparticules sont ensuite recouvertes par différents phospholipides. Les propriétés plasmoniques acquises grâce aux grains d'or sont caractérisées puis utilisées pour suivre l'interaction avec les lipides et/ou les protéines. Le suivi de ces interactions est également visualisé par analyse de la mobilité électrophorétique des particules. La deuxième stratégie développée, consiste à assembler un système membranaire sur une surface solide d'or. Dans un premier temps, une couche de calmoduline est liée à la surface de manière stable. Dans un deuxième temps, une bicouche est formée au-dessus de la couche de calmoduline par deux méthodes. La première méthode consiste à ancrer la bicouche directement sur la couche de protéine par un mécanisme faisant intervenir des lipides chélateurs.
