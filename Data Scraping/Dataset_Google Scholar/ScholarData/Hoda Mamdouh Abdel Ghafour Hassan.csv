Securing the AODV Protocol Using Specification-Based Intrusion Detection,"Hoda Hassan, Mohy Mahmoud, Sherif Elkassas",2006,Conference 2nd ACM international workshop on Quality of service & security for wireless and mobile networks,This paper presents an implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aiming to secure the AODV protocol designed for MANET. The IDS is designed as multiple static agents that run on a subset of the nodes in the network and executes a monitoring protocol that observes the process of route establishment. The monitoring protocol uses specification based intrusion detection to identify misuses to the routing messages. The IDS design is a correlation of previous work done in the field of MANET security. The IDS is implemented using ns-2 simulator and its ability to detect attacks was tested using previously devised attack scripts. Detailed specification for the runtime behavior of the AODV protocol was derived in the process of implementation,27
CellNet: a bottom-up approach to network design,"Hoda Hassan, Mohamed Eltoweissy, Moustafa Youssef",2009/12/20,"Conference 2009 3rd International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security","The ever-increasing dependence on the Internet is challenged by several factors impeding the smooth transition to the nomadic and ubiquitous future communications. These hindering factors are primarily attributed to the top-down approach in designing computer networks that resulted in adopting a layered architecture for abstracting network functionalities as well as for engineering protocols; a methodology that proved to be neither adaptable nor evolvable in response to changes in network operational requirements and technological advancements. This paper presents a bottom-up strategy for designing computer networks through i) the formalization of network design core principles, ii) the derivation of a conceptual framework for network concerns and a structural model for network building elements inspired by natural complex systems, thus introducing the network cell which is the network elementary building …",13
Towards a Framework for Evolvable Network Design,"Hoda Hassan, Ramy Eltarras, Mohamed Eltoweissy",2009,"Conference Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing","The layered Internet architecture that had long guided network design and protocol engineering was an “interconnection architecture” defining a framework for interconnecting networks rather than a model for generic network structuring and engineering. We claim that the approach of abstracting the network in terms of an internetwork hinders the thorough understanding of the network salient characteristics and emergent behavior resulting in impeding design evolution required to address extreme scale, heterogeneity, and complexity. This paper reports on our work in progress that aims to: 1) Investigate the problem space in terms of the factors and decisions that influenced the design and development of computer networks; 2) Sketch the core principles for designing complex computer networks; and 3) Propose a model and related framework for building evolvable, adaptable and self organizing networks …",9
Routing and reliable transport layer protocols interactions in MANETs,"Hoda Hassan, Mai El-Shehaly, Ayman Abdel-Hamid",2007/11/27,Conference 2007 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems,"Several research works have attempted to study the performance of TCP and SCTP in MANETS. In this paper we further aim to study the effects of these two transport layer protocols and that of the underlying routing protocols using a two-factor full factorial experimental design with replication through simulations. The routing protocols considered are AODV, DSR, and DSDV. Our motivation is that despite the efforts in comparing the different protocols at each layer separately, little is known about which layer has the greater effect on throughput in MANETS, and hence deserves further research, and how relevant the interaction between the layers is. We attempted to use mobility models to reflect realistic mobility scenarios. Our results show that the transport layer protocols have significant effect on throughput regardless of the routing layer protocol used: SCTP outperformed TCP in all cases.",6
A Deep Learning Computer-Aided Diagnosis Approach for Breast Cancer,"and M. M. A. Zaalouk A. M. Zaalouk, G. A. Ebrahim, H. K. Mohamed, H. M. Hassan",2022/8,Journal Bioengineering,"Breast cancer is a gigantic burden on humanity, causing the loss of enormous numbers of lives and amounts of money. It is the world’s leading type of cancer among women and a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. The histopathological examination of breast tissue biopsies is the gold standard for diagnosis. In this paper, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on deep learning is developed to ease the pathologist’s mission. For this target, five pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models are analyzed and tested—Xception, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, VGG19, and ResNet152—with the help of data augmentation techniques, and a new approach is introduced for transfer learning. These models are trained and tested with histopathological images obtained from the BreakHis dataset. Multiple experiments are performed to analyze the performance of these models through carrying out magnification-dependent and magnification-independent binary and eight-class classifications. The Xception model has shown promising performance through achieving the highest classification accuracies for all the experiments. It has achieved a range of classification accuracies from 93.32% to 98.99% for magnification-independent experiments and from 90.22% to 100% for magnification-dependent experiments.",4
IASM: An Integrated Attribute Similarity for Complex Networks Generation,"Bassant Youssef, Hoda Hassan",2014,Conference 28th IEEE International Conference on Information Networking,"Complex networks are seen in different real life disciplines. They are characterized by a scale-free power-law degree distribution, a small average path length (small world phenomenon), a high average clustering coefficient, and the emergence of community structure. Most proposed complex networks models did not incorporate all of the four common properties of complex networks. Models have also neglected incorporating the heterogeneous nature of network nodes. In this paper, we propose two generation models for heterogeneous complex networks. We introduce the Integrated Attribute Similarity Model (IASM). IASM uses preferential attachment to connect nodes based on their attributes similarities integrated with node's structural popularity (normalized degree or Eigen vector centrality). IASM proposed model is modified to increase their clustering coefficient using a triad formation step.",4
Transformation of Coloured Petri Nets to UML 2 Diagrams,"Ayman Yassin, Hoda Hassan",2014,Conference New Perspectives in Information Systems and Technologies,"Business Process Modeling Notation is used by business modelers to model business processes logic and artifacts. However, it is inadequate in expressing the execution semantics of business processes and takes a process-oriented approach for modeling systems. UML, on the other hand, is known for its expressiveness to present the object-oriented approach for modeling software-based system. There is a rising need to transform business process models to flawless UML models. This paper proposes a modeling transformation technique for transforming a business process-modeling notation model to different UML diagrams, using Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) as a formal intermediate step to ensure flawless transformation. This transformation would allow modeler to take advantages of the presentation power in BPMN as well as the implementation power in UML. Furthermore, this step will bridge the gap …",4
Towards a Federated Network Architecture,"Hoda Hassan, Mohamed Eltoweissy, Mostafa Youssef",2008,Conference INFOCOM Student Workshops,"The layered architecture that guided the design of the Internet is deemed inadequate as a reference model for engineering protocols for NGN. Layered protocol suites impose a strict sequential order on protocol execution conflicting with the efficient engineering of end systems, as well as failing to express vertical functional integration, the separation of control and data planes, and the distributed nature of network functions. Furthermore, protocols developed according to the layered architecture are implemented as monolithic blocks with undefined or implicit dependencies lacking flexibility to adapt to changing application requirements. We claim that NGN architecture design should be dual faceted along a vertical and a horizontal dimension. The vertical dimension addresses complexity at a network node by abstracting the communication functionality into several components and defining component interactions …",4
Get as you pay model for IaaS cloud computing,"Sherif Yehia AbdelGhany, Hoda Mamdouh Hassan",2018/11/16,Conference 2018 International Conference on Smart Communications and Networking (SmartNets),"The IaaS cloud computing model is the foundation over which all other cloud computing services can be built. Thus, the migration from the traditional datacenter model to the cloud-computing model is highly dependent on the guarantees that the IaaS Cloud Provider can offer Cloud User to sustain service quality. These guarantees are expressed using Service Level Agreement (SLA) whose need to be aligned and tightly coupled with the cloud service lifecycle so as to reflect the financial and technical dynamicity of the SLA. However, we argue that the SLAs used at present are deficient in expressing solid guarantees on the service quality and lack the auto-negotiation feature required by cloud services. In that respect, SLAs used in practice do not fully abide by the ""Pay as you Go"" model for cloud computing. In this paper, we propose the ""Get as you Pay"" model that extends the ""Pay as You Go"" model by …",3
CORM: A Reference Model for Future Computer Networks,"Hoda Hassan, Mohamed Eltoweissy",2012,Journal Journal of Network and Computer Applications,"This paper acknowledges the need for revolutionary designs to devise the Future Internet by presenting a clean-slate Concern-Oriented Reference Model (CORM) for architecting future networks. CORM is derived in accordance to the Function–Behavior–Structure engineering framework, conceiving computer networks as a distributed software-dependent complex system. CORM networks are designed along two main dimensions: a vertical dimension addressing structure and configuration of network building blocks; and a horizontal dimension addressing communication and interaction among the previously formulated building blocks. For each network dimension, CORM factors the design space into function, structure, and behavior, applying to each the principle of separation of concerns for further systematic decomposition. Perceiving the network as a complex system, CORM constructs the network recursively …",3

A Reference Model and Architecture for Future Computer Networks,Hoda Mamdouh Hassan,2010/5/26,Institution Virginia Tech,"The growing need for a trustworthy Future Internet demands evolutionary approaches unfettered by legacy constrains and concepts. The networking community is calling for new network architectural proposals that address the deficiencies identified in present network realizations, acknowledge the need for a trustworthy IT infrastructure, and satisfy the society's emerging and future requirements. Proposed architectures need to be founded on well-articulated design principles, account for network operational and management complexities, embrace technology and application heterogeneity, regulate network-inherent emergent behavior, and overcome shortcomings attributed to present network realizations.   This dissertation presents our proposed clean-slate Concern-Oriented Reference Model (CORM) for architecting future computer networks. CORM stands as a guiding framework from which network architectures can be derived according to specific functional, contextual, and operational requirements or constraints. CORM represents a pioneering attempt within the network realm, and to our knowledge, CORM is the first reference model that is bio-inspired and derived in accordance with the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) engineering framework.

A Profit Oriented Session-based Admission Control Mechanism for the Cloud Environment,"AbdelRahman Tawakol, Hoda Hassan, Samah Senbel",2014,Conference 4th International Workshop on Pervasive and Context-Aware Middleware,"The proliferation of cloud-computing services has encouraged business-owners to migrate their applications to the cloud. With the existence of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) in the cloud, the business-owners can guarantee the quality of service they were promised to get from the providers. However, in such shared environment, there is a high probability of overload situations to occur violating the SLA, and causing profit losses to both providers and clients. This paper proposes an SLA-aware Profit-Oriented session-based Admission Control (POAC) mechanism that manages the overload problem in three-tier Web-based applications hosted on a cloud environment. The proposed Admission Control (AC) was validated using simulation. Our experiments show that the proposed approach makes profit-aware decisions, while taking the SLA in consideration. Thus benefiting both the service providers and the …",
