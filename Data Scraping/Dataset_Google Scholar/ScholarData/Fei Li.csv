Catch me if you can: A cloud-enabled DDoS defense,"Quan Jia, Huangxin Wang, Dan Fleck, Fei Li, Angelos Stavrou, Walter Powell",2014/6/23,Conference 2014 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks,"We introduce a cloud-enabled defense mechanism for Internet services against network and computational Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Our approach performs selective server replication and intelligent client re-assignment, turning victim servers into moving targets for attack isolation. We introduce a novel system architecture that leverages a ""shuffling"" mechanism to compute the optimal re-assignment strategy for clients on attacked servers, effectively separating benign clients from even sophisticated adversaries that persistently follow the moving targets. We introduce a family of algorithms to optimize the runtime client-to-server re-assignment plans and minimize the number of shuffles to achieve attack mitigation. The proposed shuffling-based moving target mechanism enables effective attack containment using fewer resources than attack dilution strategies using pure server expansion. Our …",146
A moving target DDoS defense mechanism,"Huangxin Wang, Quan Jia, Dan Fleck, Walter Powell, Fei Li, Angelos Stavrou",2014/6/15,Journal Computer Communications,"In this paper, we introduce a moving target defense mechanism that defends authenticated clients against Internet service DDoS attacks. Our mechanism employs a group of dynamic, hidden proxies to relay traffic between authenticated clients and servers. By continuously replacing attacked proxies with backup proxies and reassigning (shuffling) the attacked clients onto the new proxies, innocent clients are segregated from malicious insiders through a series of shuffles. To accelerate the process of insider segregation, we designed an efficient greedy algorithm which is proven to have near optimal empirical performance. In addition, the insider quarantine capability of this greedy algorithm is studied and quantified to enable defenders to estimate the resource required to defend against DDoS attacks and meet defined QoS levels under various attack scenarios. Simulations were then performed which confirmed the …",135
An optimal online algorithm for packet scheduling with agreeable deadlines,"Fei Li, Jay Sethuraman, Clifford Stein",2005/1/23,Journal SODA," Motivation: best-effort service provided by today’s networks cannot support assured data transmission for real-time applications. Goal: if the arriving packets cannot all be stored in a buffer, or if the packets have deadlines by which they must be delivered, the switch needs to identify the packets that should be dropped, without knowledge of future arrivals.",79
Better online buffer management,"Fei Li, Jay Sethuraman, Clifford Stein",2007/1/7,Book Proceedings of the eighteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,"As the Internet becomes more mature, there is a realization that improving the performance of routers has the potential to substantially improve Internet performance in general. Currently, most routers forward packets in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order. However, the diversity of applications supported by modern IP-based networks has resulted in unpredictable packet flows, and heterogeneous network traffic. Thus, it is becoming more reasonable to consider differentiating between different types of packets, and perhaps to consider allowing packets to specify a deadline by which it must be processed. These issues have made buffer management at routers a critical issue in providing effective quality of service to the various applications that use the network. In this paper, we study an online problem in which each packet is described by its discrete arrival time, nonnegative weight and discrete deadline; arriving packets are buffered for delivery and all packets have the same processing time. The packets arrive online, and our objective is to maximize the sum of weights of those packets that are sent by their deadlines. We describe an online deterministic algorithm with a competitive ratio of 1.854, improving the best previous known competitive ratio of 1.939 (Bartal et al. STACS 2004).",62

Towards cost-effective moving target defense against ddos and covert channel attacks,"Huangxin Wang, Fei Li, Songqing Chen",2016/10/24,Book Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense,"Traditionally, network and system configurations are static. Attackers have plenty of time to exploit the system's vulnerabilities and thus they are able to choose when to launch attacks wisely to maximize the damage. An unpredictable system configuration can significantly lift the bar for attackers to conduct successful attacks. Recent years, moving target defense (MTD) has been advocated for this purpose. An MTD mechanism aims to introduce dynamics to the system through changing its configuration continuously over time, which we call adaptations. Though promising, the dynamic system reconfiguration introduces overhead to the applications currently running in the system. It is critical to determine the right time to conduct adaptations and to balance the overhead afforded and the security levels guaranteed. This problem is known as the MTD timing problem.

Competitive scheduling of packets with hard deadlines in a finite capacity queue,Fei Li,2009/4/19,Conference IEEE INFOCOM 2009,"Motivated by the quality-of-service (QoS) buffer management problem, we consider online scheduling of packets with hard deadlines in a finite capacity queue.

Incentive mechanisms to enable fair renewable energy trade in smart grids,"Huangxin Wang, Jean X Zhang, Fei Li",2015/12/14,Conference 2015 Sixth International Green and Sustainable Computing Conference (IGSC),"In this paper, we build up a renewable/green energy trading market for users in smart grids.

Thus, a market in which users can trade surplus green energy in order to serve their future demands is highly desired. In building up such a market, we need to guarantee fairness among non-cooperative users and provide an efficient incentive mechanism based on up-to-date battery and grid technologies.

Abusing Public Third-Party Services for EDoS Attacks.,"Huangxin Wang, Zhonghua Xi, Fei Li, Songqing Chen",2016/8/8,Conference WOOT,"Cloud computing has been widely adopted nowadays as it provides economical, elastic and scalable services to customers. The cloud resources are offered in an ondemand manner and the consumers are charged based on their resource usage, known as “pay-as-you-go”. Such a cloud utility scheme opens the door to Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks in which the cloud consumers would suffer from financial losses. In this paper, we uncover the severity of EDoS attacks through demonstrating that EDoS attacks can be easily conducted at very low costs. In specific, we show that attackers can launch amplification attacks against the cloud consumers by abusing the free public third-party services provided by the Internet giants such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and LinkedIn. Through studying the characteristics of 10 main public third-party services, we reveal that all of them can be abused to launch EDoS attacks and the amplification factor can reach up to 135K. To combat against the uncovered attacks, we propose several mitigation strategies for the third-party service providers as well as the cloud consumers.",16

WebTrap: A dynamic defense scheme against economic denial of sustainability attacks,"Huangxin Wang, Zhonghua Xi, Fei Li, Songqing Chen",2017/10/9,Conference 2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),"Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks have been threatening cloud consumers' financial viability due to the “pay-as-you-go” cloud resource charging scheme. EDoS attackers can take advantage of this pricing scheme to fraudulently consume the billable cloud resources from the cloud consumers and thus, drive up the cloud consumers' financial cost and eventually disrupt their economic sustainability. In this paper, we propose WebTrap, a defense scheme against EDoS attacks for web-based systems. WebTrap consists of two major components. On one side, it dynamically changes/updates web resource addresses so that the web-based system is equipped with a moving target defense capability to make attackers unable to exploit web resources. On the other side, WebTrap injects carefully-designed traps in a real-time manner to detect attackers. The trap injection process is guided by an online control …",4

To guarantee an online algorithm's performance in hindsight, we design a randomized algorithm to schedule energy and jobs in the data centers and prove the algorithm's expected competitive ratio in a special setting. Our algorithm is theoretical-sound and it outperforms the previously known algorithms in many settings using both real traces and simulated data.

Competitive analysis of energy-constrained real-time scheduling,"Vinay Devadas, Fei Li, Hakan Aydin",2009/7/1,Conference 2009 21st Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems,"In this paper, we undertake the competitive analysis of the online real-time scheduling problems under a given hard energy constraint.

Reducing data request contentions for improved streaming quality,"Yao Liu, Fei Li, Lei Guo, Songqing Chen",2010/6/2,Book Proceedings of the 20th international workshop on Network and operating systems support for digital audio and video,"In P2P assisted multi-channel live streaming systems, it is commonly believed that in unpopular channels, quality degradation is due to the small number of participating peers with almost-the-same set of available data; this phenomena prevents effective data exchanges among peers themselves and automatically leads to data request contentions once a new data chunk becomes available. In popular programs, our measurement on PPLive for a continuous three-month period at various locations also shows numerous occurrences of quality degradation because of the even higher ratio (up to 190%) of repetitive data requests for the same data chunks.",3

IPC: An Inter-Pixel Coding Algorithm for Server-Based Computing,"Fei Li, Qiao Li",2003,Journal Seventh IASTED International Conference on Internet and Multimedia Systems and Applications,"Server-based computing (SBC) model is becoming an increasingly popular approach to deliver computational services across the network due to its reduced administrative costs and better resource utilization. All computations are carried out by the server and screen updates are sent to be displayed by the clients. While the remote display protocol (RDP) allows graphical displays to be served across a network to a client device, it nevertheless requires large amount of bandwidth. Even with broadband network access, existing SBC solutions do not perform well in scalability and real-time requirements [7].

IPC favors bandwidth-critical applications, and packets received with increased bandwidth available progressively improve visual quality. Experimental results demonstrates that there is negligible overhead for both servers and clients.
