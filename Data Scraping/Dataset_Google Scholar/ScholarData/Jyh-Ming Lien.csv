An obstacle-based rapidly-exploring random tree,"Samuel Rodriguez, Xinyu Tang, Jyh-Ming Lien, Nancy M Amato",2006/5/15,"Conference Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006. ICRA 2006.","Tree-based path planners have been shown to be well suited to solve various high dimensional motion planning problems. Here we present a variant of the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) path planning algorithm that is able to explore narrow passages or difficult areas more effectively. We show that both workspace obstacle information and C-space information can be used when deciding which direction to grow. The method includes many ways to grow the tree, some taking into account the obstacles in the environment. This planner works best in difficult areas when planning for free flying rigid or articulated robots. Indeed, whereas the standard RRT can face difficulties planning in a narrow passage, the tree based planner presented here works best in these areas",248
Approximate convex decomposition of polygons,"Jyh-Ming Lien, Nancy M Amato",2004,Conference SCG '04 Proceedings of the twentieth annual symposium on Computational geometry,"We propose a strategy to decompose a polygon, containing zero or more holes, into ``approximately convex'' pieces. For many applications, the approximately convex components of this decomposition provide similar benefits as convex components, while the resulting decomposition is significantly smaller and can be computed more efficiently. Moreover, our approximate convex decomposition (ACD) provides a mechanism to focus on key structural features and ignoreless significant artifacts such as wrinkles and surface texture a user specified tolerance determines allowable concavity. We propose a simple algorithm that computes an ACD of a polygon by iteratively removing (resolving) the most significant non-convex feature (notch). As a by product, it produces an elegant hierarchical representation that provides a series of `increasingly convex' decompositions. Our algorithm computes an ACD of a simple …",230
Approximate convex decomposition of polyhedra,"Jyh-Ming Lien, Nancy M Amato",2007/6/4,Book Proceedings of the 2007 ACM symposium on Solid and physical modeling,"Decomposition is a technique commonly used to partition complex models into simpler components. While decomposition into convex components results in pieces that are easy to process, such decompositions can be costly to construct and can result in representations with an unmanageable number of components.

Shepherding behaviors,"Jyh-Ming Lien, O Burchan Bayazit, Ross T Sowell, Samuel Rodriguez, Nancy M Amato",2004/4/26,"Conference IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2004. Proceedings. ICRA'04. 2004","Shepherding behaviors are a type of flocking behavior in which outside agents guide or control members of a flock. Shepherding behaviors can be found in various forms in nature. For example, herding, covering, patrolling and collecting are common types of shepherding behaviors. In this work, we investigate ways to simulate these types of behaviors. A shepherd uses roadmaps to steer the flock and to re-group separated flock members. This paper focuses on improving the shepherd's movements to gain better control of the flock's motion and use this improved control to demonstrate a wider variety of shepherding behaviors.",185
Simultaneous shape decomposition and skeletonization,"Jyh-Ming Lien, John Keyser, Nancy M Amato",2006/6/6,Book Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Solid and physical modeling,"Shape decomposition and skeletonization share many common properties and applications. However, they are generally treated as independent computations. In this paper, we propose an iterative approach that simultaneously generates a hierarchical shape decomposition and a corresponding set of multi-resolution skeletons. In our method, a skeleton of a model is extracted from the components of its decomposition --- that is, both processes and the qualities of their results are interdependent. In particular, if the quality of the extracted skeleton does not meet some user specified criteria, then the model is decomposed into finer components and a new skeleton is extracted from these components. The process of simultaneous shape decomposition and skeletonization iterates until the quality of the skeleton becomes satisfactory. We provide evidence that the proposed framework is efficient and robust under …",174

Better group behaviors in complex environments using global roadmaps,"O Burchan Bayazit, Jyh-Ming Lien, Nancy M Amato",2002/12/9,Journal Artif. Life,"While many methods to simulate flocking behaviors have been proposed, these techniques usually only provide simplistic navigation and planning capabilities because each flock member’s behavior depends only on its local environment. In this work, we investigate how the addition of global information in the form of a roadmap of the environment enables more sophisticated flocking behaviors and supports global navigation and planning. In this paper, we propose new techniques for four distinct group behaviors: homing, goal searching, traversing narrow areas and shepherding. Extending ideas from cognitive modeling, we embed behavior rules in individual flock members and in the roadmap. These embedded behaviors enable the creatures to modify their actions based on their current location and state. For example, the flock might move as an unordered group in open regions and in a follow-the-leader fashion through narrow passages. These behaviors exploit global knowledge of the environment and utilize information gathered by all flock members which is communicated by allowing individual flock members to dynamically update the shared roadmap to reflect (un) desirable routes or regions. We present experimental results showing how the judicious use of simple roadmaps of the environment enables complex behaviors to be obtained at minimal cost.

A general framework for sampling on the medial axis of the free space,"Jyh-Ming Lien, Shawna L Thomas, Nancy M Amato",2003/9/14,Conference 2003 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat.

It also removes the requirement of exactly computing distance metrics thereby enabling application to more realistic high dimensional problems. In particular, our framework supports methods that retract a given configuration exactly or approximately onto the medial axis. As in our previous work, exact methods provide fast and accurate retraction in low (2 or 3) dimensional space.

Probabilistic roadmap motion planning for deformable objects,"O Burchan Bayazit, Jyh-Ming Lien, Nancy M Amato",2002/5/11,Conference Proceedings 2002 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat. No. 02CH37292),"In this paper, we investigate methods for motion planning for deformable robots. Our framework is based on a probabilistic roadmap planner. As with traditional motion planning, the planner's goal is to find a valid path for the robot. Unlike typical motion planning, the robot is allowed to change its shape (deform) to avoid collisions as it moves along the path. We propose a two-stage approach. First, an 'approximate' path which may contain collisions is found. Next, we attempt to correct any collisions on this path by deforming the robot. We propose and analyze two methods for performing the deformations. Both techniques are inspired by a physically correct behavior, but are more efficient than completely, physically correct methods. Our approach can be applied in several domains, including flexible robots, computer modeling and animation, and biological simulations.",114
Roadmap-based flocking for complex environments,"O Burchan Bayazit, Jyh-Ming Lien, Nancy M Amato",2002/10/9,"Conference 10th Pacific Conference on Computer Graphics and Applications, 2002.

Generally, such work considers behaviors that can be determined independently by each flock member solely by observing its local environment, e.g., the speed and direction of its neighboring flock members. Since flock members are not assumed to have global information about the environment, only very simple navigation and planning techniques have been considered for such flocks. In this paper, we investigate how the addition of global information in the form of a roadmap of the environment enables more sophisticated flocking behaviors.

Material editing using a physically based rendering network,"Guilin Liu, Duygu Ceylan, Ersin Yumer, Jimei Yang, Jyh-Ming Lien",2017,Conference Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision,"The ability to edit materials of objects in images is desirable by many content creators. However, this is an extremely challenging task as it requires to disentangle intrinsic physical properties of an image. We propose an end-to-end network architecture that replicates the forward image formation process to accomplish this task. Specifically, given a single image, the network first predicts intrinsic properties, ie shape, illumination, and material, which are then provided to a rendering layer. This layer performs in-network image synthesis, thereby enabling the network to understand the physics behind the image formation process. The proposed rendering layer is fully differentiable, supports both diffuse and specular materials, and thus can be applicable in a variety of problem settings. We demonstrate a rich set of visually plausible material editing examples and provide an extensive comparative study.",90
Automatically generating virtual guided tours,"Tsai-Yen Li, Jyh-Ming Lien, Shih-Yen Chiu, Tzong-Hann Yu",1999/5/26,Conference Proceedings Computer Animation 1999,"After the introduction of VRML, 3D Web browsing has become a popular form of networked virtual reality. However, it is still a great challenge for a novice user equipped with a regular desktop PC to navigate in most virtual worlds of moderate complexity. We think the main problem is due to the fact that a user usually uses a 2D mouse to provide low-level navigation control but the display frame rate is not high enough for this servo loop. We consider an alternative metaphor of allowing a user to specify locations of interests on a 2D-layout map and let the system automatically generate the animation of guided tours in virtual architectural environments. Specifically, we aim to generate animations of customizable tour paths and its associated human/camera motions in an on-line manner according to high-level user inputs.

Decomposing images into layers via RGB-space geometry,"Jianchao Tan, Jyh-Ming Lien, Yotam Gingold",2016/11/15,Journal ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),"In digital image editing software, layers organize images. However, layers are often not explicitly represented in the final image, and may never have existed for a scanned physical painting or a photograph. We propose a technique to decompose an image into layers. In our decomposition, each layer represents a single-color coat of paint applied with varying opacity. Our decomposition is based on the image’s RGB-space geometry. In RGB-space, the linear nature of the standard Porter-Duff [1984] “over” pixel compositing operation implies a geometric structure. The vertices of the convex hull of image pixels in RGB-space correspond to a palette of paint colors. These colors may be “hidden” and inaccessible to algorithms based on clustering visible colors. For our layer decomposition, users choose the palette size (degree of simplification to perform on the convex hull), as well as a layer order for the paint colors …",83

Active origami structures can be applied to a broad range of areas such as reconfigurable aircraft and deployable space structures as well as instruments for minimally invasive surgery. Our current research is focused on dielectric elastomer (DE) and magneto active elastomer (MAE) materials to create multi-field responsive structures. Such multi-field responsive structures will integrate the DE and MAE materials to enable active structures that fold/unfold in different ways in response to electric and/or magnetic field. They can also unfold either as a result of eliminating the applied field or in response to the application of an opposite field.

Fast approximate convex decomposition using relative concavity,"Mukulika Ghosh, Nancy M Amato, Yanyan Lu, Jyh-Ming Lien",2013/2/1,Journal Computer-Aided Design,"Approximate convex decomposition (ACD) is a technique that partitions an input object into approximately convex components. Decomposition into approximately convex pieces is both more efficient to compute than exact convex decomposition and can also generate a more manageable number of components. It can be used as a basis of divide-and-conquer algorithms for applications such as collision detection, skeleton extraction and mesh generation. In this paper, we propose a new method called Fast Approximate Convex Decomposition (FACD) that improves the quality of the decomposition and reduces the cost of computing it for both 2D and 3D models. In particular, we propose a new strategy for evaluating potential cuts that aims to reduce the relative concavity, rather than absolute concavity.

Approximate convex decomposition,"Jyh-Ming Lien, Nancy M Amato",2004/6/8,Book Proceedings of the twentieth annual symposium on Computational geometry,"Decomposition is a technique commonly used to break complex models into sub-models that are easier to handle. Convex decomposition, which partitions the model into convex components, is interesting because many algorithms perform more efficiently on convex objects than on non-convex objects. One issue with convex decompositions, however, is that they can be costly to construct and can result in representations with an unmanageable number of components. In many applications, the detailed features of the model are not crucial and in fact considering them only serves to obscure important structural features and adds to the processing cost. In such cases, an approximate representation of the model that captures the key structural features would be preferable. Motivated by such issues, we propose a partitioning strategy that decomposes a given 2D or 3D model into “approximately convex” pieces. We …",64
A simple method for computing Minkowski sum boundary in 3D using collision detection,Jyh-Ming Lien,2010,Journal Algorithmic Foundation of Robotics VIII: Selected Contributions of the Eight International Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics,"Computing the Minkowski sum of two polyhedra exactly has been shown difficult. Despite its fundamental role in many geometric problems in robotics, to the best of our knowledge, no 3-d Minkowski sum software for general polyhedra is available to the public. One of the main reasons is the difficulty of implementing the existing methods. There are two main approaches for computing Minkowski sums: divide-and-conquer and convolution. The first approach decomposes the input polyhedra into convex pieces, computes the Minkowski sums between a pair of convex pieces, and unites all the pairwise Minkowski sums. Although conceptually simple, the major problems of this approach include: (1) The size of the decomposition and the pairwise Minkowski sums can be extremely large and (2) robustly computing the union of a large number of components can be very tricky.

Learning to segment and unfold polyhedral mesh from failures,"Zhonghua Xi, Yun-Hyeong Kim, Young J Kim, Jyh-Ming Lien",2016/8/1,Journal Computers & Graphics,"Folding planar sheets to make 3D shapes from is an ancient practice with many new applications, ranging from personal fabrication of customized items to design of surgical instruments for minimally invasive surgery in self-folding machines.

Unfolding a polyhedral mesh into planar nets usually require segmentation. Either used as a preprocessing step to simplify the mesh and provide semantics or as the result of unfolding to avoid overlapping, the segmentation and the unfolding operations are decoupled.

Dual-space decomposition of 2d complex shapes,"Guilin Liu, Zhonghua Xi, Jyh-Ming Lien",2014,Conference Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"While techniques that segment shapes into visually meaningful parts have generated impressive results, these techniques also have only focused on relatively simple shapes, such as those composed of a single object either without holes or with few simple holes. In many applications, shapes created from images can contain many overlapping objects and holes. These holes may come from sensor noise, may have important parts of the shape or may be arbitrarily complex. These complexities that appear in real-world 2D shapes can pose grand challenges to the existing part segmentation methods. In this paper, we propose a new decomposition method, called Dual-space Decomposition that handles complex 2D shapes by recognizing the importance of holes and classifying holes as either topological noise or structurally important features.

Approximate convex decomposition and its applications,Jyh-Ming Lien,2006/12,Source Dissertation Abstracts International,"Geometric computations are essential in many real-world problems. One important issue in geometric computations is that the geometric models in these problems can be so large that computations on them have infeasible storage or computation time requirements. Decomposition is a technique commonly used to partition complex models into simpler components. Whereas decomposition into convex components results in pieces that are easy to process, such decompositions can be costly to construct and can result in representations with an unmanageable number of components. In this work, we have developed an approximate technique, called Approximate Convex Decomposition (ACD), which decomposes a given polygon or polyhedron into “approximately convex” pieces that may provide similar benefits as convex components, while the resulting decomposition is both significantly smaller (typically by orders of magnitude) and can be computed more efficiently. Indeed, for many applications, an ACD can represent the important structural features of the model more accurately by providing a mechanism for ignoring less significant features, such as wrinkles and surface texture. Our study of a wide range of applications shows that in addition to providing computational efficiency, ACD also provides natural multi-resolution or hierarchical representations.

Continuous unfolding of polyhedra-a motion planning approach,"Zhonghua Xi, Jyh-Ming Lien",2015/9/28,Conference 2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),"Cut along the surface of a polyhedron and unfold it to a planar structure without overlapping is known as Unfolding Polyhedra problem which has been extensively studied in the mathematics literature for centuries. However, whether there exists a continuous unfolding motion such that the polyhedron can be continuously transformed to its unfolding has not been well studied. Recently, researchers started to recognize continuous unfolding as a key step in designing and implementation of self-folding robots. In this paper, we model the unfolding of a polyhedron as multi-link tree-structure articulated robot, and address this problem using motion planning techniques. Instead of sampling in continuous domain which traditional motion planners do, we propose to sample only in the discrete domain.

Computational wrapping: A universal method to wrap 3D-curved surfaces with nonstretchable materials for conformal devices,"Yu-Ki Lee, Zhonghua Xi, Young-Joo Lee, Yun-Hyeong Kim, Yue Hao, Hongjin Choi, Myoung-Gyu Lee, Young-Chang Joo, Changsoon Kim, Jyh-Ming Lien, In-Suk Choi",2020/4/10,Journal Science advances,"This study starts from the counterintuitive question of how we can render conventional stiff, nonstretchable, and even brittle materials sufficiently conformable to fully wrap curved surfaces, such as spheres, without failure.

Interactive Planning for Shepherd Motion.,"Jyh-Ming Lien, Emlyn Pratt",2009/3/25,Conference AAAI Spring Symposium: Agents that Learn from Human Teachers,"Shepherding problem asks how the movement of an agent (eg, predator, policeman, or sheepdog) can push a group of agents (eg, prey, crowd, or sheep) from one position to another. The shepherding problem has many important and practical applications in security, environmental protection, agriculture, education and more. While much research has focused on simulating coordinated group behaviors, the shepherding problem has not received as much attention as it should be. This work investigate the possibility of addressing the shepherding problem using motion planning strategies. From an algorithmic point of view, the shepherding problem is extremely challenging due to its extremely large state space. It is clear that the existing motion planning methods cannot provide an efficient way to solve the problem. Instead, we propose an approach that incorporates computer-human interaction techniques with algorithmic robotics: an interactive motion planning method. In our experimental results, we have shown that this combination indeed provides performance improvement over the human-only and the computeronly approach. Although the proposed work shows promising initial results from our first prototype system, there are still a long way to go before we can have a better understanding of the interactive method for motion planning and the shepherding problem.",26
A framework for planning motion in environments with moving obstacles,"Samuel Rodriguez, Jyh-Ming Lien, Nancy M Amato",2007/10/29,Conference 2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,"In this paper we present a heuristic approach to planning in an environment with moving obstacles. Our approach assumes that the robot has no knowledge of the future trajectory of the moving objects. Our framework also distinguishes between two types of moving objects in the environment: hard and soft objects. We distinguish between the two types of objects in the environment as varying application domains could allow for some collision between some types of moving objects. For example, a robot planning a path in an environment with people could have the people modeled as circular disks with a safe zone surrounding each person. Although the robot may try to stay out of each safe zone, violating that criteria would not necessarily result in planning failure. We will show the effectiveness of our planner in general dynamic environments with the soft objects having varying behaviors.",26
Towards exact numerical Voronoi diagrams,"Chee K Yap, Vikram Sharma, Jyh-Ming Lien",2012/6/27,Conference 2012 Ninth International Symposium on Voronoi Diagrams in Science and Engineering,"Voronoi diagrams are extremely versatile as a data structure for many geometric applications. Computing this diagram “exactly” for a polyhedral set in 3D has been a quest of computational geometers for over two decades; this quest is still unrealized. We will locate the difficulty in this quest, thanks to a recent result of Everett et al (2009). More generally, it points to the need for alternative computational models, and other notions of exactness. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach based on the well-known Subdivision Paradigm. A brief review of such algorithms for Voronoi diagrams is given. Our unique emphasis is the use of purely numerical primitives.

Fast and robust 2d minkowski sum using reduced convolution,"Evan Behar, Jyh-Ming Lien",2011/9/25,Conference 2011 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,"We propose a new method for computing the 2-d Minkowski sum of non-convex polygons. Our method is convolution based. The main idea is to use the reduced convolution and filter the boundary by using the topological properties of the Minkowski sum. The main benefit of this proposed approach is from the fact that, in most cases, the complexity of the complete convolution is much higher than the complexity of the final Minkowski sum boundary. Therefore, the traditional approach often wastes a large portion of the computation on computing the arrangement induced by the complete convolution that is later on thrown away. Our method is designed to specifically avoid this waste of computation. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient than the existing methods.",21

Although recent computational methods allow rapid simulation of folding process of certain rigid origami, these methods can fail even when the input crease pattern is extremely simple but requires implicit folding orders. Moreover, due to the rigidity requirement, the probability of generating a valid configuration via uniform sampling is zero, which greatly hinders the applicability of traditional sampling-based motion planners.

The α-decomposition generates a space of decompositions parameterized by α, the diameter of a circle convolved with the input polygon. As we vary the value of α, some structural features appear and disappear quickly while others persist. Therefore, by analyzing the persistence of the features, we can determine better decompositions that are more robust to both geometrical and topological noises.",20

Approximate star-shaped decomposition of point set data,Jyh-Ming Lien,2007,Publisher The Eurographics Association,"Simplification or decomposition is a common strategy to handle large geometric models, which otherwise require excessive computation to process. Star-shaped decomposition partitions a model into a set of star-shaped components. A model is star shaped if and only if there exists at least one point which can see all the points of the model. Due to this interesting property, decomposing a model into star-shaped components can be used for computing camera locations to guard a given environment (the art-gallery problem), skeleton extraction, point data compression, as well as motion planning. In this paper, we propose a simple method to partition (or cluster) point set data (PSD) into 'approximately star-shaped' components. Our method can be applied to both 2D and 3D PSD and can be naturally extended to higher dimensional spaces. Our method does not require or compute any connectivity information of the input points. The proposed method only requires the position and the outward normals of points. Our experimental results show that the size of the final decomposition is close to optimal.",17

Continuous visibility feature,"Guilin Liu, Yotam Gingold, Jyh-Ming Lien",2015,Conference Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"In this work, we propose a new type of visibility measurement named Continuous Visibility Feature (CVF). We say that a point q on the mesh is continuously visible from another point p if there exists a geodesic path connecting p and q that is entirely visible by p. In order to efficiently estimate the continuous visibility for all the vertices in a model, we propose two approaches that use specific CVF properties to avoid exhaustive visibility tests. CVF is then measured as the area of the continuously visible region. With this stronger visibility measure, we show that CVF better encodes the surface and part information of mesh than the tradition line-of-sight based visibility. For example, we show that existing segmentation algorithms can generate better segmentation results using CVF and its variants than using other visibility-based shape descriptors, such as shape diameter function.

GRIDGEN version 1.0: A computer program for generating unstructured finite-volume grids,"Jyh-Ming Lien, Guilin Liu, Christian David Langevin",2015,"Publisher US Department of the Interior, US Geological Survey","GRIDGEN is a computer program for creating layered quadtree grids for use with numerical models, such as the MODFLOW–USG program for simulation of groundwater flow. The program begins by reading a three-dimensional base grid, which can have variable row and column widths and spatially variable cell top and bottom elevations. From this base grid, GRIDGEN will continuously divide into four any cell intersecting user-provided refinement features (points, lines, and polygons) until the desired level of refinement is reached. GRIDGEN will then smooth, or balance, the grid so that no two adjacent cells, including overlying and underlying cells, differ by more than a user-specified level tolerance. Once these gridding processes are completed, GRIDGEN saves a tree structure file so that the layered quadtree grid can be quickly reconstructed as needed. Once a tree structure file has been created, GRIDGEN can then be used to (1) export the layered quadtree grid as a shapefile,(2) export grid connectivity and cell information as ASCII text files for use with MODFLOW–USG or other numerical models, and (3) intersect the grid with shapefiles of points, lines, or polygons, and save intersection output as ASCII text files and shapefiles.

Simulating flocking behaviors in complex environments,"O Burchan Bayazit, Jyh-Ming Lien, Nancy M Amato",2002,Journal Proc. of the Pacific Conf. on Computer Graphics and Applications,"Flocking behavior is very common in nature, and there have been ongoing research efforts to simulate such behavior in computer animations and robotics applications. Generally, such work considers behaviors that can be determined independently by each flock member solely by observing its local environment, eg, the speed and direction of its neighboring flock members. Since flock members are not assumed to have global information about the environment, only very simple navigation and planning techniques have been considered for such flocks. In this work, we investigate how the addition of global information in the form of a roadmap of the environment enables more sophisticated flocking behaviors. In particular, we study and propose new techniques for three distinct group behaviors: homing, exploring and shepherding. These behaviors exploit global knowledge of the environment and utilize knowledge gathered by all flock members. This knowledge is communicated by allowing individual flock members to dynamically update the shared roadmap to reflect (un) desireable routes or regions. We present experimental results showing how the judicious use of simple roadmaps of the environment enables more complex behaviors to be obtained at minimal cost.",8

This raises a foldability problem, namely that there is no guarantee that continuous motion can be found in the latter step, given a net generated in the former step. Direct evaluation on the foldability of a net is nontrivial and can be computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel learning strategy that generates foldable nets using an optimized genetic-based unfolder. The proposed strategy yields a fitness function that combines the geometric and topological properties of a net to approximate the foldability. The fitness function is then optimized in an evolution control framework to generate foldable nets. The experimental results show that our new unfolder generates valid unfoldings that are easy to fold. Consequently, our approach opens a door to automate the design of more complex self-folding machines.",7
Mapping the configuration space of polygons using reduced convolution,"Evan Behar, Jyh-Ming Lien",2013/11/3,Conference 2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,"Configuration space (C-space) plays an important role not only in motion planning but also in geometric modeling, shape and kinematic reasoning, and is fundamental to several basic geometric operations, such as continuous collision detection and generalized penetration depth estimation, that also find their applications in motion planning, animation and simulation. In this paper, we developed a new method for constructing the boundary of the C-space obstacles (C-obst) of polygons. This method is simpler to implement and is theoretically more efficient than the existing techniques. Our main idea is to devote the computation on the discontinuity in temporal and spatial coherence where the structure of the C-obst changes. We also developed a method for estimating the generalized penetration depth by computing the distance between the query point and the C-obst surface.",7
Visibility-based strategies for tracking and searching unpredictable coherent targets among known obstacles,"Christopher Vo, Jyh-Ming Lien",2010,Journal ICRA workshop: Search and pursuit/evasion in the physical world,"There are many scenarios in the real world and virtual world where it is necessary to find and track groups of coherent targets, whether they are groups of people, swarms of robots, or players in a video game. In such scenarios, some information about the environment may be available, but trajectories of the targets are usually not known in advance. This paper shows that finding unknown coherent targets in a known environment can be done asymptotically more efficiently than finding a single target. In addition, this papers presents several methods for tracking multiple coherent targets with unknown trajectories through environments with known obstacles (such as walls, buildings, etc). We also present variations of our algorithms that incorporate informed search to regain visibility of targets when they escape the camera’s view, with promising results.",7
Online collision prediction among 2D polygonal and articulated obstacles,"Yanyan Lu, Zhonghua Xi, Jyh-Ming Lien",2016/4,Journal The International Journal of Robotics Research,"Collision prediction is a fundamental operation for planning motion in dynamic           environments.

Dynamic minkowski sums under scaling,"Evan Behar, Jyh-Ming Lien",2013/2/1,Journal Computer-Aided Design,"In many common real-world and virtual environments, there are a significant number of repeated objects, primarily varying in size. Similarly, in many complex machines, there are a significant number of parts which also vary in size rather than shape. This repetition saves in both design and production costs. Recent research in robotics has also shown that exploiting workspace repetition can significantly increase efficiency. In this paper, we address the need to support computation reuse in fundamental operations. To this end, we propose an algorithm to reuse the computation of the Minkowski sum when an object is transformed by uniform scaling. The Minkowski sum is a fundamental operation in many areas of robotics, such as motion planning, computer vision, and mathematical morphology, and has been studied extensively over the last four decades.

We train a graph convolutional model to predict the scene perception scores of different teleport positions.

Fast medial-axis approximation via max-margin pushing,"Guilin Liu, Jyh-Ming Lien",2015/9/28,Conference 2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),"Maintaining clearance, or distance from obstacles and sampling efficient enough configurations on the medial axises are a vital component for successful motion planning. Maintaining high clearance often creates safer paths for robots. Having bias for sampling on medial axis also offers higher possibility to find a path in complex environment where the feasible configuration space only occupies a small proportion of the whole space. Inspired by the similarity between medial axis and max-margin scheme in optimization, especially in Support Vector Machine, we propose a new method to quickly construct the medial axis for the motion planning environment both in low and high dimensional space. However, directly applying the SVM classification on the large volume of uniformly sampled configurations suffers from huge computation and the medial axis is usually not the real medial axis due to SVM's optimization …",5

Composable group behaviors,"Jyh-Ming Lien, Samuel Rodriguez, Xinyu Tang, John Maffei, Daniel Corlette, Arnaud Masciotra, Nancy M Amato",2005/9/21,"Publisher Technical Report TR05-006, Parasol Lab., Dept. of Computer Science","Creating complex and realistic group behaviors can be a difficult and time consuming task. Automated approaches for motion generation typically involve explicitly defining a set of possible agent behaviors, associating appropriate behaviors with all environmental events, and setting the priorities among various behaviors in every possible situation. Generally, such approaches are pre-tuned to particular situations and are difficult to adapt for other scenarios or for different sets of behaviors. In this paper, we investigate methods to facilitate the generation of complex group behaviors for applications such as games, virtual reality, robotics and biological/ecological simulation. Our general approach is to provide a framework that automatically combines simple composable behaviors into more complex behaviors. Adaptation to new environments and specialization for new tasks or new agent abilities is supported by a “learning” process through which agents select their current behavior based on their prior experiences. We illustrate how our framework can be applied to pursuit/evasion and laser tag scenarios.",5
Compacting voxelized polyhedra via tree stacking,"Yue Hao, Jyh‐Ming Lien",2019/10,Journal Computer Graphics Forum,"Volume compaction is a geometric problem that aims to reduce the volume of a polyhedron via shape transform. Compactable structures are easier to transport and in some cases easier to manufacture, therefore, they are commonly found in our daily life (e.g. collapsible containers) and advanced technology industries (e.g., the recent launch of 60 Starlink satellites compacted in a single rocket by SpaceX). It is known in the literature that finding a universal solution to compact an arbitrary 3D shape is computationally challenging. Previous approaches showed that stripifying mesh surface can lead to optimal compaction, but the resulting structures were often impractical. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that cuts the 3D orthogonal polyhedron, tessellated by thick square panels, into a tree structure that can be transformed into compact piles by folding and stacking.

Fast and robust generation of city scale urban ground plan,"Jyh-Ming Lien, Fernando Camelli, WSD Wong",2011,Journal Proceedings of Computer Graphics International 2011,"Since the introduction of the concept of Digital Earth, almost every major international city has been re-constructed in the virtual world.

However, these urban models are mostly loosely structured and implicitly defined and require tedious manual preparation that usually take weeks if not months before they can be used. In this paper, we present a framework that produces well-defined ground plans from these urban models, an important step in the preparation process. Designing algorithms that can robustly and efficiently handle unstructured urban models at city scale is the main technical challenge. In this work, we show both theoretically and empirically that our method is resolution complete, efficient and numerically stable.

Metal forming with laser origami: parameter analysis and optimization,"Peiwen J Ma, Yue Hao, Jyh-Ming Lien, Edwin A Peraza Hernandez",2020/11/16,Conference ASME international mechanical engineering congress and exposition,"Laser origami is a metal forming process where an initially planar sheet is transformed into a target three-dimensional (3D) form through cutting and folding operations executed by a laser beam. A key challenge in laser origami is to determine the locations of the cuts and folds required to transform the planar sheet into the 3D target shape. The region of the planar sheet that can be transformed into the target shape through these cuts and folds is denoted as the net. This paper presents a method to determine optimal net(s) for laser origami based on criteria including minimum energy usage, minimum fabrication time, minimum error in the fold angles, and minimum material usage.

The main benefit of this proposed approach is from the fact that, in most cases, the complexity of the complete convolution is much higher than the complexity of the final Minkowski sum boundary. Therefore, the traditional approach often wastes a large portion of the computation on computing the arrangement induced by the complete convolution that is later on thrown away. Our method is designed to specifically avoid this waste of computation.

Super compaction and pluripotent shape transformation via algorithmic stacking for 3d deployable structures,"Zhonghua Xi, Yu-Ki Lee, Young-Joo Lee, Yun-hyeong Kim, Huangxin Wang, Yue Hao, Young-Chang Joo, In-Suk Choi, Jyh-Ming Lien",2018/3/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.03302,"Origami structures enabled by folding and unfolding can create complex 3D shapes. However, even a small 3D shape can have large 2D unfoldings. The huge initial dimension of the 2D flattened structure makes fabrication difficult, and defeats the main purpose, namely compactness, of many origami-inspired engineering. In this work, we propose a novel algorithmic kirigami method that provides super compaction of an arbitrary 3D shape with non-negligible surface thickness called ""algorithmic stacking"". Our approach computationally finds a way of cutting the thick surface of the shape into a strip. This strip forms a Hamiltonian cycle that covers the entire surface and can realize transformation between two target shapes: from a super compact stacked shape to the input 3D shape. Depending on the surface thickness, the stacked structure takes merely 0.001% to 6% of the original volume. This super compacted structure not only can be manufactured in a workspace that is significantly smaller than the provided 3D shape, but also makes packing and transportation easier for a deployable application. We further demonstrate that, the proposed stackable structure also provides high pluripotency and can transform into multiple 3D target shapes if these 3D shapes can be dissected in specific ways and form a common stacked structure. In contrast to many designs of origami structure that usually target at a particular shape, our results provide a universal platform for pluripotent 3D transformable structures.",2

Polyhedra Fabrication Through Mesh Convexification: A Study of Foldability of Nearly Convex Shapes,"Zhonghua Xi, Jyh-Ming Lien",2017/8/6,Conference International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference,"A polyhedron can be unfolded to a net, i.e., an unfolding without overlapping, by carefully cutting along the surface.

Decomposing Digital Paintings into Layers via RGB-space Geometry,"Jianchao Tan, Jyh-Ming Lien, Yotam Gingold",2015/9/10,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.03335,"In digital painting software, layers organize paintings. However, layers are not explicitly represented, transmitted, or published with the final digital painting. We propose a technique to decompose a digital painting into layers. In our decomposition, each layer represents a coat of paint of a single paint color applied with varying opacity throughout the image. Our decomposition is based on the painting's RGB-space geometry. In RGB-space, a geometric structure is revealed due to the linear nature of the standard Porter-Duff ""over"" pixel compositing operation. The vertices of the convex hull of pixels in RGB-space suggest paint colors. Users choose the degree of simplification to perform on the convex hull, as well as a layer order for the colors. We solve a constrained optimization problem to find maximally translucent, spatially coherent opacity for each layer, such that the composition of the layers reproduces the original image.

Determine distinct shapes of rigid origami,"Zhonghua Xi, Jyh-Ming Lien",2014/8,"Journal The 6th International Meeting on Origami in Science, Mathematics and Education (6OSME), Tokyo, Japan","Rigid origami is a class of origami whose entire surface remains rigid during folding except at crease lines. In this work, we explore the idea of determining distinct shapes that can be realized by a given crease pattern. Typically, crease pattern is designed with a single target shape in mind. However, as the advances in material science and robotics engineering enable the realization of self-folding rigid origami [Ryu et al. 2012; Ahmed et al. 2013; An et al. 2011], it is desirable to create a crease pattern that can fold into multiple shapes. Traditionally such a crease pattern is created by combining the crease patterns designed for each of the target shapes. The main limitation of such an approach is the complexity of combined crease, which often prohibits the implementation of self-folding origami due to the geometric, kinematic and material constraints. Therefore, we propose to take an approach that attempts to take an existing crease pattern and discover most distinct k foldable shapes. Our hope is that we can match one of the k distinct foldable shapes to the given target shapes, and only modify the crease pattern locally to better approximate the target shapes.",1
City-scale urban transport and dispersion simulation using geographic information system footprints,"Jyh-Ming Lien, Yanyan Lu, Fernando Camelli, David Wong",2012/7/1,Book Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Computing for Geospatial Research and Applications,"A large volume of urban models describing urban objects in major international cities has been re-constructed and become freely and publicly available via software like Arc-Globe and Google Earth.

Learning to Herd Amongst Obstacles from an Optimized Surrogate,"Jixuan Zhi, Jyh-Ming Lien",2022/10/23,Conference 2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),"This paper investigates how a shepherd robot can efficiently steer a coherent group by intelligently moving behind the group in obstacle-filled environments. It was been shown that a model trained by deep reinforcement learning can guide a small number (2–4) of agents among obstacles. However, herding a larger group becomes significantly more challenging because it exhibits the characteristics similar to manipulating a deformable object, i.e., the system is dynamic and the problem is highly underactuated. To overcome these challenges, we show that a model can be trained more effectively via an optimized surrogate, such as a potential field that optimizes the control quality of the group without explicitly considering the placement of the shepherd. Our experiments demonstrate that the trained model is robust to noise for group behaviors and environments. Compared to the rule-based method, the proposed …",
Origami-based Zygote structure enables pluripotent shape-transforming deployable structure,"Yu-Ki Lee, Yue Hao, Zhonghua Xi, Woongbae Kim, Youngmin Park, Kyu-Jin Cho, Jyh-Ming Lien, In-Suk Choi",2022/8/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.04204,"We propose an algorithmic framework of a pluripotent structure evolving from a simple compact structure into diverse complex 3-D structures for designing the shape transformable, reconfigurable, and deployable structures and robots. Our algorithmic approach suggests a way of transforming a compact structure consisting of uniform building blocks into a large, desired 3-D shape. Analogous to the pluripotent stem cells that can grow into a preprogrammed shape according to coded information, which we call DNA, compactly stacked panels named the zygote structure can evolve into arbitrary 3-D structures by programming their connection path. Our stacking algorithm obtains this coded sequence by inversely stacking the voxelized surface of the desired structure into a tree. Applying the connection path obtained by the stacking algorithm, the compactly stacked panels named the zygote structure can be deployed into diverse large 3-D structures. We conceptually demonstrated our pluripotent evolving structure by energy releasing commercial spring hinges and thermally actuated shape memory alloy (SMA) hinges, respectively. We also show that the proposed concept enables the fabrication of large structures in a significantly smaller workspace.",
Metal Blossom: Laser Forming Complex and Freeform Metal Structures Imitating Flower Blooming,"Yue Hao, Peiwen J Ma, Huaishu Peng, Edwin A Peraza Hernandez, Jyh-Ming Lien",2021/11/30,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.15083,"For centuries, human civilizations devised metal forming techniques to make tools and items; yet, customized metal forming remains costly and intricate.

Designing foldable structures formable by lasers, however, has long been a trial-and-error practice that requires significant mental effort and hinders the possibility of creating practical structures. This work demonstrates for the first time that lasergami can form a freeform set of metallic structures previously believed to have been impossible to be laser-formed. This technological breakthrough is enabled by new computational origami methods that imitate flower blooming and optimize laser folding instructions. Combined with new ideas that address laser line of sight and minimize fabrication energy, we report a low-cost manufacturing framework that can be readily adopted by hobbyists and professionals alike.",

Persistent Covering of a Graph under Latency and Energy Constraints,"Jyh-Ming Lien, Sam Rodriguez, Marco Morales",2021/1/25,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.10438,"Most consumer-level low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have limited battery power and long charging time. Due to these energy constraints, they cannot accomplish many practical tasks, such as monitoring a sport or political event for hours. The problem of providing the service to cover an area for an extended time is known as persistent covering in the literature. In the past, researchers have proposed various hardware platforms, such as battery-swapping mechanisms, to provide persistent covering. However, algorithmic approaches are limited mostly due to the computational complexity and intractability of the problem. Approximation algorithms have been considered to segment a large area into smaller cells that require periodic visits under the latency constraints. However, these methods assume unlimited energy. In this paper, we explore geometric and topological properties that allow us to significantly reduce the size of the optimization problem. Consequently, the proposed method can efficiently determine the minimum number of UAVs needed and schedule their routes to cover an area persistently. We demonstrated experimentally that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the baseline methods.",

Modeling Saltwater Intrusion using Adaptive Mesh Refinement,"CD Langevin, SM Panday, JD Hughes, J Lien",2012/12,Journal AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,"Numerical simulation of saltwater intrusion often requires fine discretization to accurately represent variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport. With adaptive mesh refinement methods, grid resolution can be focused in areas with high concentration gradients. This resolution can change during the simulation by coarsening or refining in different parts of the model as concentration gradients change. To test adaptive mesh refinement, we implemented a variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport simulator using an object-oriented design. The method is based on an unstructured grid implementation of quadtree refinement. With quadtree refinement individual cells can be subdivided into four equal-sized cells. This refinement can occur anywhere in the model and to any grid nesting level. An implicit ghost-node correction concept was utilized to ensure that solutions to the variable-density flow …",

Roadmap-Based Flocking for Complex Environments,Jyh-Ming Lien,2002,"Journal 10th Pacific Conference on Computer Graphics and Applications: Proceedings: October 9-11, 2002, Tsinghua University, Beijing","Flocking behavior is very common in nature, and there have been ongoing research efforts to simulate such be-havior in computer animations and robotics applications. Generally, such work considers behaviors that can be determined independently by each flock member solely by observing its local environment, eg, the speed and direction of its neighboring flock members. Since flock members are not assumed to have global information about the environ-ment, only very simple navigation and planning techniques have been considered for such flocks. In this work, we investigate how the addition of global information in the form of a roadmap of the environment enables more sophisticated flocking behaviors. In par-ticular, we study and propose new techniques for three distinct group behaviors: homing, exploring and shep-herding. These behaviors exploit global knowledge of the environment and utilize knowledge gathered by all flock members. This knowledge is communicated by al-lowing individual flock members to dynamically update the shared roadmap to reflect (un) desirable routes or re-gions. We present experimental results showing how the judicious use of simple roadmaps of the environment en-ables more complex behaviors to be obtained at minimal cost.
