Cooperative team strategies for multi-player perimeter-defense games,"Daigo Shishika, James Paulos, Vijay Kumar",2020/4,Journal IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,"This letter studies a variant of the multi-player reach-avoid game played between intruders and defenders with applications to perimeter defense. The intruder team tries to score by sending as many intruders as possible to the target area, while the defender team tries to minimize this score by intercepting them. Finding the optimal strategies of the game is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the joint state space. Existing works have proposed approximation methods to reduce the design of the defense strategy into assignment problems, however, they suffer from either suboptimal defender performance or computational complexity. Based on a novel decomposition method, this letter proposes a scalable (polynomial-time) assignment algorithm that accommodates cooperative behaviors and outperforms the existing defense strategies. For a certain class of initial configurations, we derive the exact score by …",78
Local-game decomposition for multiplayer perimeter-defense problem,"Daigo Shishika, Vijay Kumar",2018/12/17,Conference 2018 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"This paper studies a multi-player game between intruders and defenders. The intruder team tries to score by sending as many intruders as possible to the target. The defender team tries to minimize this score by intercepting the intruders. Finding the strategies for both teams and estimating the outcome of the game is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the joint state space. The state-of-the-art method decomposes the game into two-player games and reduces the design of the defense strategy to an assignment problem, whose solution gives an upper bound on the score. We investigate the cooperative aspects of the multi-player game that are not captured in the aforementioned approach and propose a decomposition method that leads to the formation of local sub-teams. We use the method to design a cooperative-intrusion strategy that guarantees a lower bound on the score. The presented results …",74
Team composition for perimeter defense with patrollers and defenders,"Daigo Shishika, James Paulos, Michale R Dorothy, M Ani Hsieh, Vijay Kumar",2019/12,Conference 2019 58th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"We study team composition in the context of a multi-player pursuit-evasion game between intruders and defenders. The game has been previously studied assuming full state information on both teams. We extend this problem by requiring defenders to detect intruders using a limited sensor footprint before pursuit can begin. We simplify the policy synthesis for a heterogeneous team by decomposing the perimeter defense task into patrol and defense subtasks each performed by a homogeneous team. We derive a nonlinear relationship between the robot capabilities, the team sizes, and the overall defensive team performance. This interaction is then used to consider how to select the robots for each subtask when various types of robots with heterogeneous capabilities are available. We present how to accommodate parameter uncertainties and the coupling between the two subtasks in the team composition.",36
A review of multi agent perimeter defense games,"Daigo Shishika, Vijay Kumar",2020,"Source Decision and Game Theory for Security: 11th International Conference, GameSec 2020, College Park, MD, USA, October 28–30, 2020, Proceedings 11","This paper reviews a series of works done on the multi-agent perimeter defense scenario, in which a team of intruders try to score by reaching the target region while a team of defenders try to minimize the score by intercepting those intruders. We describe how the small-scale differential games are solved and are leveraged to design team strategies in the large-scale swarm versus swarm scenarios. Three different approaches to analyze the large-scale games (MM, MIS, and LGR) are introduced with comments on their relative strengths and weaknesses. As a unique contribution of this paper, we discuss how the existing results can be extended into more general problem formulations. Furthermore, we point out the limitations of the current work and suggest potential directions for future research.",30
Male motion coordination in anopheline mating swarms,"Daigo Shishika, Nicholas C Manoukis, Sachit Butail, Derek A Paley",2014/9/12,Journal Scientific reports,"The Anopheles gambiae species complex comprises the primary vectors of malaria in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the mating in these species occurs in swarms composed almost entirely of males. Intermittent, organized patterns in such swarms have been observed, but a detailed description of male-male interactions has not previously been available. We identify frequent, time-varying interactions characterized by periods of parallel flight in data from 8 swarms of Anopheles gambiae and 3 swarms of Anopheles coluzzii filmed in 2010 and 2011 in the village of Donéguébogou, Mali. We use the cross correlation of flight direction to quantify these interactions and to induce interaction graphs, which show that males form synchronized subgroups whose size and membership change rapidly. A swarming model with damped springs between each male and the swarm centroid shows good agreement with the …",22
Decentralization of multiagent policies by learning what to communicate,"James Paulos, Steven W Chen, Daigo Shishika, Vijay Kumar",2019/5/20,Conference 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),"Effective communication is required for teams of robots to solve sophisticated collaborative tasks. In practice it is typical for both the encoding and semantics of communication to be manually defined by an expert; this is true regardless of whether the behaviors themselves are bespoke, optimization based, or learned. We present an agent architecture and training methodology using neural networks to learn task-oriented communication semantics based on the example of a communication-unaware expert policy. A perimeter defense game illustrates the system's ability to handle dynamically changing numbers of agents and its graceful degradation in performance as communication constraints are tightened or the expert's observability assumptions are broken.",21
Perimeter-defense game between aerial defender and ground intruder,"Elijah S Lee, Daigo Shishika, Vijay Kumar",2020/12/14,Conference 2020 59th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"We study a variant of pursuit-evasion game in the context of perimeter defense. In this problem, the intruder aims to reach the base plane of a hemisphere without being captured by the defender, while the defender tries to capture the intruder. The perimeter-defense game was previously studied under the assumption that the defender moves on a circle. We extend the problem to the case where the defender moves on a hemisphere. To solve this problem, we analyze the strategies based on the breaching point at which the intruder tries to reach the target and predict the goal position, defined as optimal breaching point, that is achieved by the optimal strategies on both players. We provide the barrier that divides the state space into defender-winning and intruder-winning regions and prove that the optimal strategies for both players are to move towards the optimal breaching point.

Guarding a circular target by patrolling its perimeter,"Alexander Von Moll, Meir Pachter, Daigo Shishika, Zachariah Fuchs",2020/12/14,Conference 2020 59th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"In this paper, the problem of guarding a circular target wherein the Defender(s) is constrained to move along its perimeter is posed and solved using a differential game theoretic approach. Both the one-Defender and two-Defender scenarios are analyzed and solved. The mobile Attacker seeks to reach the perimeter of the circular target, whereas the Defender(s) seeks to align itself with the Attacker, thereby ending the game. In the former case, the Attacker wins, and the Attacker and Defender play a zero sum differential game where the payoff/cost is the terminal angular separation. In the latter case, the Defender(s) wins, and the Attacker and Defender play a zero sum differential game where the cost/payoff is the Attacker's terminal distance to the target. This formulation is representative of a scenario in which the Attacker inflicts damage on the target as a function of its terminal distance. The state-feedback …",16
Adaptive partitioning for coordinated multi-agent perimeter defense,"Douglas G Macharet, Austin K Chen, Daigo Shishika, George J Pappas, Vijay Kumar",2020/10/24,Conference 2020 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),"Multi-Robot Systems have been recently employed in different applications and have advantages over single-robot systems, such as increased robustness and task performance efficiency. We consider such assemblies specifically in the scenario of perimeter defense, where the task is to defend a circular perimeter by intercepting radially approaching targets. Possible intruders appear randomly at a fixed distance from the perimeter and with azimuthal location determined by some unknown probability density. Coordination among multiple defenders is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we focus on the following two aspects: (i) estimating the probability density that describes the direction from which the next intruders are going to arrive, and (ii) partitioning of the space so that the defenders focus on capturing a disjoint subset of intruders. Results show that the proposed strategy increases the …",16
Mosquito-inspired distributed swarming and pursuit for cooperative defense against fast intruders,"Daigo Shishika, Derek A Paley",2019/10/15,Journal Autonomous Robots,"Inspired by the swarming behavior of male mosquitoes that aggregate to attract and subsequently pursue a female mosquito, we study how random swarming motion in autonomous vehicles affects the success of target capture. We consider the scenario in which multiple guardians with limited perceptual range and bounded acceleration are deployed to protect an area from an intruder. The main challenge for the guardian (male mosquito) is to quickly respond to a fast intruder (female) by matching its velocity. We focus on the motion strategy for the guardians before they perceive the intruder, which we call the swarming phase. In the parameter space consisting of the intruder’s speed and guardians’ ability (i.e., maximum acceleration and perceptual range) we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for target capture. We propose a swarming algorithm inspired by the behavior of male mosquitoes to …",12
Robust Lyapunov control design for bioinspired pursuit with autonomous hovercraft,"Daigo Shishika, Justin K Yim, Derek A Paley",2016/5/18,Journal IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,"The problem of pursuit has been studied mostly in the context of missile guidance and navigation; however, it is also an essential component in biological systems ranging from prey capture to mating and in bioinspired engineering applications with small agile vehicles. This paper considers the pursuit problem with a focus on robustness to noisy sensor measurements and efficiency in the control effort. We design a pursuit law based on Lyapunov analysis and establish its robustness to unknown target acceleration and measurement errors using the concept of ultimate boundedness. Robustness to control saturation is analyzed using the phase portrait of the closed-loop system. We also present results from experiments that were conducted to study the practical challenges involved in pursuit by lightweight platforms with noisy sensors. These experiments highlight the benefit of using less control effort in the presence …",12
Perimeter-defense game on arbitrary convex shapes,"Daigo Shishika, Vijay Kumar",2019/9/9,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.03989,"This paper studies a variant of multi-player reach-avoid game played between intruders and defenders. The intruder team tries to score by sending as many intruders as possible to the target area, while the defender team tries to minimize this score by intercepting them. Specifically, we consider the case where the defenders are constrained to move on the perimeter of the target area. Since it is challenging to directly solve the multi-player game due to the high dimensionality of the joint state space, we leverage the solutions to smaller scale problems. First, we solve the one vs. one game, for which existing works either rely on numerical approaches or make simplifying assumptions (e.g., circular perimeter, or equal speed). This paper accommodates target areas with any arbitrary convex shapes and provides analytical solution which lends itself to a useful geometric interpretation. We also provide a detailed discussion on the optimality of the derived strategies. Secondly, we solve the two vs. one game to introduce a cooperative pincer maneuver, where a pair of defenders team up to capture an intruder that cannot be captured by either one of the defender individually. Finally, we introduce how the aforementioned building blocks are used in three different assignment-based defense strategies.",11

We consider the scenario in which multiple guardians with limited perceptual range are deployed to protect an area from an aerial intruder. The intruder becomes a target once it enters the perceptual range of a guardian and, when a guardian becomes a pursuer, it speeds up and chases the target. We focus on the strategy in the swarming phase, when the intruder has not yet been perceived by any of the guardians. In the parameter space consisting of the intruder's speed and guardians' ability (i.e., maximum acceleration and perceptual range) we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for target capture.

Optimal multi-robot perimeter defense using flow networks,"Austin K Chen, Douglas G Macharet, Daigo Shishika, George J Pappas, Vijay Kumar",2022,Conference Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems: 15th International Symposium,"In perimeter defense, a team of defenders seeks to intercept a team of intruders before they reach the perimeter. Though the single defender case is relatively well studied, with multiple defenders significant complexity is introduced because coordination must also be considered. In this work, we present a formulation of the perimeter defense problem as an instance of the min-cost-max-flow problem for flow networks, and leverage existing efficient algorithms for network flows to solve both the task assignment and routing problems for perimeter defense concurrently. When considering homogeneous defender robots, the computed solution is optimal for any individual timestep. Additionally, we detail a deconflict-based strategy for dealing with heterogeneous defenders, and show in simulation that the proposed solutions match or outperform a naive greedy baseline.",8
Dynamic defender-attacker blotto game,"Daigo Shishika, Yue Guan, Michael Dorothy, Vijay Kumar",2022/6/8,Conference 2022 American Control Conference (ACC),"This work studies a dynamic, adversarial resource allocation problem in environments modeled as graphs. A blue team of defender robots are deployed in the environment to protect the nodes from a red team of attacker robots. We formulate the engagement as a discrete-time dynamic game, where the robots can move at most one hop in each time step. The game terminates with the red team’s win if any location has more attacker robots than defender robots at any time. The goal is to identify dynamic resource allocation strategies, as well as the conditions that determines the winner: graph structure, available resources, and initial conditions. We analyze the problem using reachable sets and show how the outdegree of the underlying graph directly influences the difficulty of the defending task. Furthermore, we provide algorithms that identify sufficiency of attacker’s victory.",7
The turret-runner-penetrator differential game,"Alexander Von Moll, Daigo Shishika, Zachariah Fuchs, Michael Dorothy",2021/5/25,Conference 2021 American Control Conference (ACC),"A scenario is considered in which two cooperative Attackers aim to infiltrate a circular target guarded by a Turret.

When the Turret's look angle is aligned with an Attacker, that Attacker is terminated. In this paper, we focus on a region of the state space wherein only one of the Attackers is able to reach the target circle - and even then, only with the help of its partner Attacker. The Runner distracts the Turret and ends up being terminated in order that the Penetrator can be guaranteed to hit the target circle.

Partial information target defense game,"Daigo Shishika, Dipankar Maity, Michael Dorothy",2021/5/30,Conference 2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),"We formulate a scenario in which an autonomous defender is tasked with intercepting an intruder that tries to reach a circular target region. This is a variant of the target defense problem proposed by Isaacs as a pursuit-evasion game. Unlike the original target guarding problem and its various extensions, we consider the effect of partial information by imposing sensing limitation to the robots. We analyze the game by decomposing it into three game phases: deployment, asymmetric information, and engagement phase. Focusing on a particular parameter regime, we propose a simple defender strategy together with the lower bound on the probability that it wins the game. The defender strategy in each phase is constructed so that the subsequent phase starts in a desired initial configuration. The proposed problem is rich in terms of the parameter regimes that it contains, and thus is expected to be a useful platform in …",6

Resilient consensus in robot swarms with periodic motion and intermittent communication,"Xi Yu, David Saldaña, Daigo Shishika, M Ani Hsieh",2021/7/1,Journal IEEE Transactions on Robotics,"In this article, we propose an approach to construct a time-varying communication topology with a resilient consensus performance for robot swarms with limited communication ranges. The robots are deployed to explore a large task space and achieve consensus despite the existence of a finite number of noncooperative members in the team. Existing methods encouraged robots to stay close to each other to achieve certain robustness requirements on the connectivity of the communication topology. We leverage on the robots’ mobility to design a time-varying integrated topology composed of several subgroups of robots deployed on nonoverlapping closed-loop paths. Robots are spread out and move along the paths, forming periodic communication links within or across groups. We analyze the time-varying topology synthesized and provide sufficient conditions for individual subgroups and the interconnection …",5
Modular robot formation and routing for resilient consensus,"Xi Yu, Daigo Shishika, David Saldana, M Ani Hsieh",2020/7/1,Conference 2020 American Control Conference (ACC),"We consider a team of mobile robots with limited communication range tasked to coordinate in large environments. The robots need to maximize the covered area and achieve consensus in the presence of non-cooperative robots. Existing works in robot networks showed that a team can achieve resilient consensus by maintaining an r-robust communication network. However, the communication range of each robot needs to be large to satisfy the conditions of r-robustness. This paper relaxes this requirement on the communication range by leveraging the robot motion. Specifically, we design modular dynamic formations where subsets of robots move along simple closed curves. These modules can be linked together to assemble larger formations. We derive conditions based on periodic robot connections for individual and interconnected modules. We present module designs that satisfy the sufficient conditions in …",5
Lyapunov stability analysis of a mosquito-inspired swarm model,"Daigo Shishika, Derek A Paley",2015/12/15,Conference 2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"Self-propelled particle models have been used to study the collective behavior of animal groups such as fish schools and bird flocks, and these models have also been useful in designing control strategies for fleets of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we construct a dynamical particle model inspired by mating swarms of wild mosquitoes. The model generates three different behaviors (swarming, velocity alignment, and pursuit) by switching the model parameters. Behaviors are generated by interaction forces based on springs and dampers. Previous studies of mosquito flight data suggest proximity in the velocity space, as well as the spatial distance, may determine the type of interaction. The stability properties of the velocity-alignment behavior, which generates intermittent parallel motion, and its effect on the success of the pursuit behavior are studied using Lyapunov analysis.

Defending a perimeter from a ground intruder using an aerial defender: Theory and practice,"Elijah S Lee, Daigo Shishika, Giuseppe Loianno, Vijay Kumar",2021/10/25,"Conference 2021 IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR)","The perimeter defense game has received interest in recent years as a variant of the pursuit-evasion game. A number of previous works have solved this game to obtain the optimal strategies for defender and intruder, but the derived theory considers the players as point particles with first-order assumptions. In this work, we aim to apply the theory derived from the perimeter defense problem to robots with realistic models of actuation and sensing and observe performance discrepancy in relaxing the first-order assumptions. In particular, we focus on the hemisphere perimeter defense problem where a ground intruder tries to reach the base of a hemisphere while an aerial defender constrained to move on the hemisphere aims to capture the intruder.

Game Theoretic Formation Design for Probabilistic Barrier Coverage,"Daigo Shishika, Douglas G Macharet, Brian M Sadler, Vijay Kumar",2020/10,Conference IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),"We study strategies to deploy defenders/sensors to detect intruders that approach a targeted region. This scenario is formulated as a barrier coverage, which aims to minimize the number of unseen paths. The problem becomes challenging when the number of defenders is insufficient for a full coverage, requiring us to find the most effective location to deploy them. To this end, we use ideas from game theory to account for various paths that the intruders may take. Specifically, we propose an iterative algorithm to refine the set of candidate defender formations, which uses the payoff matrix to directly evaluate the utility of different formations. Given the set of candidate formations, a mixed Nash equilibrium gives a stochastic policy to deploy the defenders. The efficacy of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by a numerical analysis that compares our method with an existing graph-theoretic method.",4
Minimal exposure dubins orienteering problem,"Douglas G Macharet, Armando Alves Neto, Daigo Shishika",2021/2/22,Journal IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,"Visiting and observing specified locations is a fundamental task for various applications including environmental monitoring and military operations. The Orienteering Problem (OP) is a variant of routing problems in which the goal is to maximize the objective function by visiting the most rewarding locations while respecting a limited travel budget (e.g., distance or time). However, traditional formulations of routing problems generally neglect some environmental peculiarities, such as obstacles or threatening zones. In this letter, we tackle the OP considering Dubins vehicles in the presence of a known deployed sensor field. We propose a novel multi-objective formulation called the Minimal Exposure Dubins Orienteering Problem (MEDOP), whose goals are to (i) maximize the collected reward, while (ii) minimizing the exposure of the agent, i.e., the probability of being detected.

Path defense in dynamic defender-attacker blotto games (ddab) with limited information,"Austin K Chen, Bryce L Ferguson, Daigo Shishika, Michael Dorothy, Jason R Marden, George J Pappas, Vijay Kumar",2022/4/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.04176,"We consider a path guarding problem in dynamic Defender-Attacker Blotto games (dDAB), where a team of robots must defend a path in a graph against adversarial agents. Multi-robot systems are particularly well suited to this application, as recent work has shown the effectiveness of these systems in related areas such as perimeter defense and surveillance. When designing a defender policy that guarantees the defense of a path, information about the adversary and the environment can be helpful and may reduce the number of resources required by the defender to achieve a sufficient level of security. In this work, we characterize the necessary and sufficient number of assets needed to guarantee the defense of a shortest path between two nodes in dDAB games when the defender can only detect assets within -hops of a shortest path. By characterizing the relationship between sensing horizon and required resources, we show that increasing the sensing capability of the defender greatly reduces the number of defender assets needed to defend the path.",2
One apollonius circle is enough for many pursuit-evasion games,"Michael Dorothy, Dipankar Maity, Daigo Shishika, Alexander Von Moll",2021/11/17,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.09205,"This paper investigates obstacle-free simple motion pursuit-evasion problems where the pursuer is faster and game termination is point capture. It is well known that the interior of the Apollonius Circle (AC) is the evader's dominance region, however, it was unclear whether the evader could reach outside the initial AC without being captured. We construct a pursuit strategy that guarantees the capture of an evader within an arbitrarily close neighborhood of the initial AC. The pursuer strategy is derived by reformulating the game into a nonlinear control problem, and the guarantee holds against any admissible evader strategy. Our result implies that the evader can freely select the capture location, but only inside the initial AC. Therefore, a class of problems, including those where the payoff is determined solely based on the location of capture, are now trivial.",2

The intruders’ objective is to breach the target boundary without being captured by the defender. As soon as the current intruder breaches the target or gets captured by the defender, the next intruder appears at a random location on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender’s final location at the end of the current game becomes its initial location for the next game. Thus, the players pick strategies that are advantageous for the current as well as for the future games. Depending on the information available to the players, each game is divided into two phases: partial information and full information phase. Under some assumptions on the sensing and speed capabilities, we analyze the agents’ strategies in both phases. We derive equilibrium strategies for both the …",
Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics Models With Stubborn Individuals Over Signed Graphs,"Nima Zahabi, Daigo Shishika",2022/9/28,Journal IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems,"In this paper, we use nonlinear continuous opinion dynamics models to investigate how the opinions in social networks are affected by the existence of stubborn individuals who remain attached to their initial opinions. Specifically, we are interested in the case where trust-mistrust relations also exist in the network. We extend the existing models,  stubborn positives  and  stubborn extremists , by using signed graphs and allowing negative edges to model mistrust interactions. The effect of stubborn individuals is studied for both structurally balanced and unbalanced graphs. We show that, due to the stubborn individuals, a bipartite consensus (polarization) might not occur even if the associated graph is structurally balanced. Moreover, for structurally unbalanced graphs, the opinion vector does not always converge to 0 as compared to the well-known Altafini's model because of stubborn individuals. We present …",

To answer this, we consider the Dynamic Defender-Attacker Blotto Game (dDAB) played on a graph, in which a fleet of defensive assets must be maneuvered through a network with the objective of defending a specified set of nodes from an adversarial fleet. In this framework, we seek to understand how the defender's objective (which nodes to defend in the graph) affects the amount of resources required to provide a safety guarantee. Particularly, we are interested in understanding how to defend paths-through and perimeters-of regions of space. Using the dDAB framework, we show the necessary and sufficient size of the defender's fleet needed to guarantee the defense of line graphs and cycle graphs, respectively.

The Player aims to minimize the cost associated with its total movements, while the Opponent tries to maximize it. The set of feasible convex bodies is finite and known to both agents, which allows us to provide performance guarantees with max-min optimality rather than in the form of competitive ratio. Under certain assumptions, we showed the continuity of the optimal value function, based on which, we designed an algorithm that numerically generates policies with performance guarantees.

Zero-sum differential game of degree for both the attacker-win and defender-win scenarios are studied, where the payoff is defined to be the distance between the two agents at the time of game termination. We derive the equilibrium strategies and the Value function by leveraging the solution for the infinite-length target scenario. The zero-level set of this Value function provides the barrier surface that divides the state space into defender-win and attacker-win regions. We present simulation results to demonstrate the theoretical results.",
Work-in-Progress: Development of a new hands-on STEM program for biologically inspired maritime robotics,"Leigh McCue, Adrian Hagarty, Cameron Nowzari, Ali Raz, Michael Riggi, Jessica Rosenberg, Daigo Shishika, Cynthia Smith, Jill Nelson",2022/8/23,Conference 2022 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,"This paper documents the work-in-progress to develop a STEM outreach program providing 9th-12th grade high-school aged learners with an introduction to biologically inspired underwater robotics using lighter-than-air (LTA) vehicles. This work includes prototype kit development targeting a comparable cost per kit as SeaPerch ($179) and SeaGlide ($249) and instructional materials comprised of demonstration videos and standards-aligned written curricular content to facilitate classroom implementation. LTA vehicles are utilized specifically for their unique ability to demonstrate fundamental concepts applicable to both aircraft and underwater vehicles including structural analysis, aerodynamics and hydrodynamics, biologically inspired propulsion, systems engineering, and swarm dynamics, without requiring student access to pools or other bodies of water.",
DC-CAPT: Concurrent Assignment and Planning of Trajectories for Dubins Cars,"Michael Whitzer, Daigo Shishika, Dinesh Thakur, Vijay Kumar, Amanda Prorok",2020/5/31,Conference 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),"We present an algorithm for the concurrent assignment and planning of collision-free trajectories (DC-CAPT) for robots whose kinematics can be modeled as Dubins cars, i.e., robots constrained in terms of their initial orientation and their minimum turning radius. Coupling the assignment and trajectory planning subproblems allows for a computationally tractable solution. This solution is guaranteed to be collision- free through the use of a single constraint: the start and goal locations have separation distance greater than some threshold. We derive this separation distance by extending a prior work that assumed holonomic robots. We demonstrate the validity of our approach, and show its efficacy through simulations and experiments where groups of robots executing Dubins curves travel to their assigned goal locations without collisions.",
Mosquito-inspired Swarming and Pursuit for Autonomous Rotorcraft,Daigo Shishika,2017,Institution University of Maryland,"The long-term goal of this research is to design cooperative-control algorithms for autonomous vehicles inspired by the collective behaviors in animal groups.  The specific research objectives of this dissertation are twofold: (1) to analyze and model the swarming and pursuit behaviors observed in the mating swarms of mosquitoes, and (2) to design mosquito-inspired control algorithms to perform swarming and pursuit with autonomous rotorcraft.   The first part of this dissertation analyzes the reconstructed flight data of the malarial mosquito Anopheles gambiae to characterize the velocity-alignment interaction between male mosquitoes, who aggregate to form mating swarms and subsequently pursue a female mosquito.  Both swarming and pursuit behaviors are represented using self-propelled particle models.  The model is used together with tools from control theory to investigate the connection between  velocity-alignment behavior and  success in pursuit.  The results of this research have a potential impact on vector-control methods for malaria, and are also utilized in the second part of this dissertation.  The second part of this dissertation studies two types of pursuit problems inspired by the collective behavior in mosquito swarms.  The first problem considers the strategy for a single pursuer chasing a single target.  This problem has been studied extensively for the application to missile guidance and navigation.  Here, we tailor the assumptions on the dynamics of the agents as well as the design criteria for the application to small and agile rotorcraft.  The second pursuit problem incorporates the swarming behavior by considering a scenario in …",
Team Coordination on Graphs with State-Dependent Edge Cost,"Sara Oughourli, Manshi Limbu, Zechen Hu, Xuan Wang, Xuesu Xiao, Daigo Shishika","This paper studies a team coordination problem in a graph environment. Specifically, we incorporate “support” action which an agent can take to reduce the cost for its teammate to traverse some edges that have higher costs otherwise. Due to this added feature, the graph traversal is no longer a standard multi-agent path planning problem. To solve this new problem, we propose a novel formulation that poses it as a planning problem in the joint state space: the joint state graph (JSG). Since the edges of JSG implicitly incorporate the support actions taken by the agents, we are able to now optimize the joint actions by solving a standard single-agent path planning problem in JSG. One main drawback of this approach is the curse of dimensionality in both the number of agents and the size of the graph. To improve scalability in graph size, we further propose a hierarchical decomposition method to perform path planning in two levels. We provide complexity analysis as well as a statistical analysis to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.","Scholar articles Team Coordination on Graphs with State-Dependent Edge CostS Oughourli, M Limbu, Z Hu, X Wang, X Xiao…","This paper studies a team coordination problem in a graph environment.
