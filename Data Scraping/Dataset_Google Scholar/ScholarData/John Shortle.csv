Fundamentals of queueing theory,"John F Shortle, James M Thompson, Donald Gross, Carl M Harris",2018/3/29,Volume 399,"The definitive guide to queueing theory and its practical applications—features numerous real-world examples of scientific, engineering, and business applications Thoroughly updated and expanded to reflect the latest developments in the field, Fundamentals of Queueing Theory, Fifth Edition presents the statistical principles and processes involved in the analysis of the probabilistic nature of queues. Rather than focus narrowly on a particular application area, the authors illustrate the theory in practice across a range of fields, from computer science and various engineering disciplines to business and operations research. Critically, the text also provides a numerical approach to understanding and making estimations with queueing theory and provides comprehensive coverage of both simple and advanced queueing models. As with all preceding editions, this latest update of the classic text features a unique blend of the theoretical and timely real-world applications. The introductory section has been reorganized with expanded coverage of qualitative/non-mathematical approaches to queueing theory, including a high-level description of queues in everyday life. New sections on non-stationary fluid queues, fairness in queueing, and Little’s Law have been added, as has expanded coverage of stochastic processes, including the Poisson process and Markov chains.• Each chapter provides a self-contained presentation of key concepts and formulas, to allow readers to focus independently on topics relevant to their interests• A summary table at the end of the book outlines the queues that have been discussed and the types of results that have …",403
Method and tool for calculating impact of voice traffic on fast packet networks,"Harvey J Benson, John F Shortle",2003/3/11,Patent office US,"An analysis method provides a bandwidth calculation for employing voice communications over fast packet (FP) networks such as frame relay or ATM. Many companies currently have internal phone systems such as private branch exchange (PBX), which provide for the transmission of voice communication within an enterprise, but also a connection to the public switch telephone network (PSTN). In addition, PBX systems may be interconnected via a system of inter-PBX tie trunks, generally used for internal PBX-PBX communication. If a PBX system employs a private data network utilizing FP technology such as frame relay, it is now possible to route this inter-PBX voice traffic over the data network. In situations where the data network is a FP network such as frame relay or ATM, an analysis is performed to determine whether there is sufficient bandwidth to handle the voice traffic. A software tool uses historical data on …",225
An algorithm to compute the waiting time distribution for the M/G/1 queue,"John F Shortle, Percy H Brill, Martin J Fischer, Donald Gross, Denise MB Masi",2004/5,Journal INFORMS Journal on Computing,"In many modern applications of queueing theory, the classical assumption of exponentially decaying service distributions does not apply. In particular, Internet and insurance risk problems may involve heavy-tailed distributions. A difficulty with heavy-tailed distributions is that they may not have closed-form, analytic Laplace transforms. This makes numerical methods, which use the Laplace transform, challenging. In this paper, we develop a method for approximating Laplace transforms. Using the approximation, we give algorithms to compute the steady state probability distribution of the waiting time of an M/G/1 queue to a desired accuracy. We give several numerical examples, and we validate the approximation with known results where possible or with simulations otherwise. We also give convergence proofs for the methods.",59
Difficulties in simulating queues with Pareto service,"Donald Gross, John F Shortle, Martin J Fischer, Denise M Bevilacqua Masi",2002/12/8,Conference Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference,"M/G/1 queues, where G is a heavy-tailed distribution, have applications in Internet modeling and modeling for insurance claim risk. The Pareto distribution is a special heavy-tailed distribution called a power-tailed distribution, and has been found to serve as adequate models for many of these situations. However, to get the waiting time distribution, one must resort to numerical methods, e.g., simulation. Many difficulties arise in simulating queues with Pareto service and we investigate why this may be so. Even if we are willing to consider truncated Pareto service, there still can be problems in simulating if the truncation point (maximum service time possible) is too large.",56
Transmission-capacity expansion for minimizing blackout probabilities,"John Shortle, Steffen Rebennack, Fred W Glover",2013/9/13,Journal IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,"The objective of this paper is to determine an optimal plan for expanding the capacity of a power grid in order to minimize the likelihood of a large cascading blackout. Capacity-expansion decisions considered in this paper include the addition of new transmission lines and the addition of capacity to existing lines. We embody these interacting considerations in a simulation optimization model, where the objective is to minimize the probability of a large blackout subject to a budget constraint. The probability of a large-scale blackout is estimated via Monte Carlo simulation of a probabilistic cascading blackout model. Because the events of interest are rare, standard simulation is often intractable from a computational perspective. We apply a variance-reduction technique within the simulation to provide results in a reasonable time frame. Numerical results are given for some small test networks including an IEEE 14-bus …",52
Simulating collision probabilities of landing airplanes at nontowered airports,"John F Shortle, Yue Xie, CH Chen, George L Donohue",2004/1,Journal Simulation,"Making greater use of smaller airports is one way that has been proposed to increase                the capacity of the National Airspace System. A major difficulty is that many small                airports do not have control towers, and thus capacity is severely limited during                poor visibility. The authors consider a proposed system in which airplanes                self-separate, so they are able to land at higher capacities without a control                tower. Before such a system is implemented, it must first be shown to be safe.                Safety is a difficult metric to measure and predict because accidents are so rare.                Even computer simulation can be slow because of the long time to observe accidents.                One methodology that has been successful in assessing aviation safety through                simulation is TOPAZ (Traffic Organizer and Perturbation AnalyZer).

Analyzing the waiting time process in internet queueing systems with the transform approximation method,"Martin J Fischer, Donald Gross, DM Bevilacqua Masi, John F Shortle",2001,Journal The Telecommunications Review,"The underlying arrival and service distributions of Internet traffic are drawn from a family of distributions, which are known as heavy-tailed distributions. These distributions have tails that decay much slower than exponential and do not possess a closed form Laplace transform. This feature significantly limits the use of standard queueing theory analysis techniques on Internet-type queueing systems. We have developed an analysis method, known as the Transform Approximation Method (TAM), to overcome this problem. TAM has been successfully applied to the analysis of the queue length process of systems with heavy-tailed service distributions and to systems with heavy-tailed arrivals. In this paper, we examine the use of TAM in analyzing the waiting time process in systems with heavy-tailed service times. The original version of TAM was modified and successfully applied to this problem. The modification and …",44
Using the transform approximation method to analyze queues with heavy-tailed service,"John F Shortle, Martin J Fischer, Donald Gross, Denise MB Masi",2003/2,Journal Journal of Probability and Statistical Science,"Many modern queueing problems involve probability distributions which are heavy-tailed. This means their distribution functions decay more slowly than any exponential function. Analyzing queues with these distributions is difficult since they do not have closed-form, analytic Laplace transforms. This paper investigates a recently proposed method for numerically approximating Laplace transforms, called the Transform Approximation Method (TAM). While TAM can be used to approximate the Laplace transform of a heavy-tailed distribution, one must still invert a Laplace transform to recover the desired probability distribution. This paper investigates using TAM with two numerical methods for inverting Laplace transforms. In particular, we compare the well-known Fourier-series method with a recursion method. We give several benchmark problems and algorithms to compare the methods. In general, the Fourier method is better at finding P (Wq≤ t) for a single t. For the inverse problem, neither method clearly dominates.",35

Efficient simulation of blackout probabilities using splitting,John F Shortle,2013/1/1,Journal International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,"Standard Monte-Carlo simulation may be computationally intractable when the events of interest are extremely rare. This paper applies the rare-event simulation technique of splitting to the problem of estimating large-scale blackout probabilities. First, a stochastic model of cascading line failures is developed. Then, a simple network is presented and an analytical solution is derived for the simple network. Exploration of the analytical solution provides some guidance for setting splitting parameters in more complicated networks. In particular, geometrically increasing levels typically give an improvement over equally-spaced levels, due to the cascading nature of blackouts. The splitting methodology is applied to several different network topologies of varying complexity – a mesh network, a grid network, and the IEEE 118-bus network. Numerical results indicate that splitting has the potential to be effective on problems …",32
Efficient splitting simulation for blackout analysis,"Sing-Po Wang, Argon Chen, Chih-Wen Liu, Chun-Hung Chen, John Shortle, Jin-Yi Wu",2014/9/30,Journal IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,"The analysis of severe blackouts has become an essential part of transmission grid planning and operation. This may include evaluation of rare-event probabilities, which can be difficult to estimate. While simulation offers flexibility to model large complex systems, efficiency remains a big concern when estimating very small probabilities. This paper presents an effective simulation technique to evaluate rare-event probabilities associated with cascading blackouts in an electric grid. We test our technique on an IEEE 118-bus electric network and show that it can dramatically improve simulation efficiency. We also demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively locate vulnerable links. These are links whose failures lead to the highest probabilities of a blackout event.",31

An equivalent random method with hyper-exponential service,John F Shortle,2004/7/1,Journal Performance Evaluation,"The Equivalent Random Method (ERM) has been widely used to predict blocking probabilities at overflow service stations. The method assumes that service times follow an exponential distribution. While this may be a reasonable assumption for voice traffic, it is not a good assumption for dial-up Internet traffic, where service times typically have a coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) greater than 1. In this paper, we give a modified ERM for two-term hyper-exponential service distributions. The method is based on an efficient algorithm to estimate the peakedness of the overflow process of an M/H2/S/S queue. Finally, we investigate the accuracy of the modified ERM using simulation and also compare systems with hyper-exponential service to systems with heavy-tailed service.",27
Airport terminal-approach safety and capacity analysis using an agent-based model,"Yue Xie, John Shortle, George Donohue",2004/12/5,"Conference Proceedings of the 2004 Winter Simulation Conference, 2004.","The consistent growth of air traffic demand is causing the operational volumes at hub airports to approach their maximum capacities. With this growth, delays are increasing, and safety is becoming a more crucial problem. The terminal approaching and landing phases are especially important since the airspace is more crowded and operational procedures are more complicated compared with the en route phase. We have developed an agent-based stochastic simulation model which is useful to analyze the relationship among airport arrival capacity, delay, and safety. We first present a simplified queue model to demonstrate key ideas. Then, we give a detailed agent-based model that is calibrated to Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. We use the model to evaluate several operational scenarios and examine the trade-offs between system capacity and safety.",26
Waiting-Time Distribution of M/DN/1 Queues Through Numerical Laplace Inversion,"John F Shortle, Martin J Fischer, Percy H Brill",2007/2,Journal INFORMS Journal on Computing,"This paper considers an M/G/1 queue where the service time for each customer is a discrete random variable taking one of N values. We call this an M/DN/1 queue. There are potential numerical problems inverting Laplace transforms associated with this queue because the service distribution is discontinuous. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of numerical transform-inversion methods in analyzing this queue. We first derive continuity properties of the steady-state distribution of wait in the M/DN/1 queue. Then, we show analytically how continuity properties affect the performance of the Fourier method for inverting transforms. In particular, continuity is not required in all derivatives for best performance of the method. We also present a new inversion method specifically for the M/DN/1 queue. Finally, we give numerical experiments comparing these and four other inversion methods. Although …",22
Optimal splitting for rare-event simulation,"John F Shortle, Chun-Hung Chen, Ben Crain, Alexander Brodsky, Daniel Brod",2012/5/1,Journal IIE Transactions,"Simulation is a popular tool for analyzing large, complex, stochastic engineering systems. When estimating rare-event probabilities, efficiency is a big concern, since a huge number of simulation replications may be needed in order to obtain a reasonable estimate of the rare-event probability. The idea of splitting has emerged as a promising variance reduction technique. The basic idea is to create separate copies (splits) of the simulation whenever it gets close to the rare event. Some splitting methods use an equal number of splits at all levels. This can compromise the efficiency and can even increase the estimation variance. This article formulates the problem of determining the number of splits as an optimization problem that minimizes the variance of an estimator subject to a constraint on the total computing budget. An optimal solution for a certain class of problems is derived that is then extended to the problem …",21
Approximation for a two-class weighted fair queueing discipline,"John F Shortle, Martin J Fischer",2010/10/1,Journal Performance Evaluation,"This paper presents an approximating model for a 2-class weighted fair queueing (or random polling) model. The approximating system can be analyzed analytically to obtain mean performance measures such as expected delay. We show through a formal argument that the approximation works well when the overall utilization of the system ρ is small. Based on simulation experiments, we develop a modified version of the approximation that is accurate for a wide range of ρ. Finally, we extend the approximation to more complex queueing scenarios, such as the low-latency-queueing discipline and systems with more than 2 classes.",21
Statistics of the approach process at Detroit metropolitan Wayne county airport,"B Jeddi, John F Shortle, Lance Sherry",2006/6/24,Journal Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Research in Air Transportation (ICRAT),"Dealing with uncertainty is a necessary and difficult aspect in operations analysis of complex systems such as the air transportation system. We represent these uncertainties in the approach process by probability distributions. This paper provides statistical observations of the approach and landing process at Detroit Metropolitan airport (DTW) for one week of February 2003. These probability distributions are based on aircraft track record data at DTW which are collected by a multilateration surveillance system. After explaining characteristics of the database and its short comings, we present a methodology to extract necessary statistical samples. From this, we obtain appropriate probability distributions for landing time interval (LTI), inter arrival distance (IAD), and runway occupancy time (ROT) presented under instrument flight rules (IFR) and peak traffic periods.",20

Methodology for collision risk assessment of an airspace flow corridor concept,"Yimin Zhang, John Shortle, Lance Sherry",2015/10/1,Journal Reliability Engineering & System Safety,"This paper presents a methodology to estimate the collision risk associated with a future air-transportation concept called the flow corridor. This concept is designed to reduce congestion and increase throughput in en-route airspace by creating dedicated flight corridors across the continent. The methodology is a hybrid collision-risk methodology combining Monte Carlo simulation and dynamic event trees. Monte Carlo simulation is used to model the movement of aircraft within the corridor and to identify potential trajectories that might lead to a collision. Dynamic event trees are used to evaluate the effectiveness of subsequent safety layers that protect against collisions. The overall risk assessment captures the unique characteristics of the flow corridor concept, including self-separation within the corridor, lane change maneuvers, speed adjustments, and the automated separation assurance system.

Safety and sensitivity analysis of the advanced airspace concept for NextGen,"John Shortle, Lance Sherry, Arash Yousefi, Richard Xie",2012/4/24,"Conference 2012 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference","This paper presents a model and methodology for a safety and sensitivity analysis of the Advanced Airspace Concept. This analysis is part of a larger effort to analyze safety-capacity tradeoffs in NextGen concepts. A key part of the model is the definition of a dynamic event tree, which is like a standard event tree, but also includes the dimension of time in the state-space description. The model is constructed and evaluated in an automated fashion based on a set of input tables. Thus, changes to the model are easily implemented and results are automatically recomputed. The analytical implementation can be evaluated fairly quickly (a couple seconds per evaluation). A systematic sensitivity analysis shows that the transponder failure probability is a critical model parameter.",19

A statistical analysis of the aircraft landing process,"JEDDI BABAK GHALEBSAZ, George L Donohue, John F Shortle",2009/1/1,Volume 3,"Managing operations of the aircraft approach process and analyzing runway landing capacity, utilization and related risks require detailed insight into the stochastic characteristics of the process. These characteristics can be represented by probability distributions. The focus of this study is analyzing landings on a runway operating independent of other runways making it as a single runway. We provide statistical analysis of the final approach and runway occupancy time at Detroit airport at peak traffic periods on one of its major landing runways. Many weeks of aircraft track record data collected by a multilateration surveillance system is analyzed. We explain some characteristics and short comings of the database, and extract samples of the random variables of interest (ie aircraft time and distance separation, runway occupancy time, simultaneous runway occupancy, and aircraft speed).

Predicting dynamic imbalance in rotors,"John F Shortle, Max B Mendel",1996/1/1,Journal Probabilistic engineering mechanics,"This paper derives probability models which predict dynamic imbalance of rotors. The models are based on physical laws and specific knowledge of how the rotors are made. Several sources of imbalance are considered. It is shown that wider tolerances in the orientation of a rotor lead to more likely worst-case imbalances. It is shown that the expected dynamic imbalance of a cylinder is proportional to the square root of the feed rate of the cutting tool over the speed. Thus, such models show how various parameters in the manufacturing process affect the distribution of imbalance. In this way, manufacturing decisions on how to effectively reduce imbalance can be made prior to observing any data.",17
Airspace risk management using surveillance track data: Stabilized approaches,"Zhenming Wang, Lance Sherry, John Shortle",2015/4/21,"Conference 2015 Integrated Communication, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","The outcome of operations in a designated airspace is a function of the cooperation between flights in the airspace and the coordination of Air Traffic Control (ATC). A critical airspace is the approach airspace in which flights are sequenced and separated to minima to maximize utilization of the available runways. Airline procedures call for flights to meet “stable approach criteria” at 1000 ft. and 500 ft. above ground level (AGL). ATC procedures define the trajectories flown, including airspeed, to maximize throughput through the airspace and runways. The ability to achieve the stabilized approach criteria is therefore a function of the coordination of the flight crews and ATC.

This discipline is playing a vital role as IP brings these traffic classes together in a truly converged network.

"One-parameter pareto, two-parameter pareto, three-parameter pareto: is there a modeling difference?","Martin J Fischer, Denise M Bevilacqua Masi, Donald Gross, John F Shortle",2005,Journal The Telecommunications Review,"The Pareto distribution was first formulated in the late 1800s by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. He presented the argument that in all countries and times, the distribution of income and wealth could be described by the formula log (N)= log (A)+ mlog (x), where N is the proportion of income earners who receive incomes higher than x, and A and m are constants. Over the years, Pareto’s Law has held up in empirical studies. The Pareto distribution has recently been used as a model for file sizes on the Internet, insurance losses, financial behavior of the stock market, and in telecommunications systems. It has various forms; here, we consider a one-parameter form and a two-parameter form. Thus, we question if using one form of the Pareto gives different results than using another form.

Optimal Computing Budget Allocation for Stochastic N– Problem in the Power Grid System,"Yue Liu, Giulia Pedrielli, Haobin Li, Loo Hay Lee, Chun-Hung Chen, John F Shortle",2019/6/14,Journal IEEE Transactions on Reliability,"The N-k problem is very well known in the power industry and it tries to answer the question whether there exists a set of k lines in a power network with N elements whose removal would cause the failure of the system.

While this problem has traditionally been considered in a deterministic setting, stochastic behavior within the system is important especially in the context of extreme events. A number of stochastic Monte Carlo models have been proposed to estimate the probability of cascading failures. In this paper, we deal with simulation budget allocation of the stochastic N-1 problem. More specifically, we assume that a simulation model is able to provide us an estimate of the system failure rate when any line is tripped.

Collision risk-capacity tradeoff analysis of an en-route corridor model,"Bojia Ye, Minghua Hu, John Friedrich Shortle",2014/2/1,Journal Chinese Journal of Aeronautics,Flow corridors are a new class of trajectory-based airspace which derives from the next generation air transportation system concept of operations.

This paper presents an analysis of multilateration data that uses an extension of an algorithm. Key results are as follows: the separation distribution does not appear to change much at different points along the approach path. The left tail of separation (corresponding to the smallest separation values) decays faster than a normal distribution. This is positive from a safety perspective. If this behavior is extrapolated beyond the observed data, one can conjecture that smaller separations have probabilities that rapidly decay to effectively zero. Lateral positions near the threshold do not appear to be heavy tailed, either. Finally, estimates of the final approach separation variability are consistent with previously published results.",14

In IMC, the observed standard deviations at different distances are similar between the two airports. The results reported in this paper are also similar to those reported at St. Louis (STL) in [1]. Visual comparison of the observed distributions also shows a close similarity. This provides some indication that distributions observed at one airport in IMC may generalize to other airports. In VMC, there are some differences between the distributions. We also fit probability density functions (PDFs) to lateral and vertical positions. In general, the normal distribution provides the best fit among the normal, lognormal, gamma, and Weibull families. The quality of the fit is better in IMC closer to the runway threshold.",14
Estimation of potential conflict rates as a function of sector loading,"Akshay Belle, John Shortle, Arash Yousefi, R Xie",2012/5/22,"Journal 5th International Conference on Research in Air Transportation, Berkeley, CA","Automated separation assurance systems are being developed to reduce controller workload and increase airspace capacity of the National Airspace System (NAS). To evaluate these systems, a measure for conflict risk is required. The objective of this analysis is to estimate the rate at which flights enter a course of potential conflict or collision under different traffic loads. Conflict rates are estimated under the assumption of no conflict resolution. In other words, the analysis is aimed at estimating precursors to actual conflicts. The conflict rates are estimated (a) using a NAS-wide simulation,(b) for a futuristic NAS-wide 1.5 X traffic schedule,(c) for airway routes and great circle routes,(d) for different conflict-volume dimensions (conflict types), and (e) for different sector traffic loads. Conflict types include loss of separation (LOS), critical loss of separation (CLOS), near mid air collision (NMAC), and mid air collision (MAC). The simulation of flight trajectories and detection of conflicts are done using Future Air Traffic Management Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET). A hybrid analyticalsimulation approach is also used to estimate the rate of MACs. A key result is that the rates of NMACs and MACs for the airway routes are higher than the corresponding rates for the greatcircle routes. The results also show that conflict rates follow the quadratic relationship with respect to flight count.",13

The simulation of rare events, such as the occurrence of a catastrophic worm attack, is impractical without special simulation techniques. In this paper we present an application of splitting methods to estimate rare-event probabilities associated with the propagation of a worm through a network. We explore the sensitivity of the benefits of splitting methods, as compared to standard simulation, to the rarity of the event and the level function used.",11
A preliminary study of optimal splitting for rare-event simulation,"John F Shortle, Chun-Hung Chen",2008/12/7,Conference 2008 Winter Simulation Conference,"Efficiency is a big concern when using simulation to estimate rare-event probabilities, since a huge number of simulation replications may be needed in order to obtain a reasonable estimate of such a probability. Furthermore, when multiple designs must be compared, and each design requires simulation of a rare event, then the total number of samples across all designs can be prohibitively high. This paper presents a new approach to enhance the efficiency for rare-event simulation. Our approach is developed by integrating the notions of level splitting and optimal computing budget allocation. The goal is to determine the optimal numbers of simulation runs across designs and across a number of splitting levels so that the variance of the rare-event estimator is minimized.",11
Using multilateration data in probabilistic analysis of wake vortex hazards for landing aircraft,"John F Shortle, Babak G Jeddi",2007,Journal Transportation research record,"Wake vortices are a safety hazard to landing aircraft. A landing aircraft that encounters a wake may roll; this might result in a fatal crash if the roll is severe enough or if the aircraft is low enough to the ground. Therefore, aircraft are separated by a sufficient distance to ensure that wakes have time to decay in strength. However, because of the inherent variability in wake behavior and aircraft separation and position, there is still a possibility for a wake encounter. To estimate the probability of such encounters, a hybrid simulation methodology is presented. The approach is hybrid in the sense that part of the simulation is conducted by using a direct data feed of flight-track data, and the other part is obtained by simulation of wake-evolution models. The approach is demonstrated on a 1-week sample of flight tracks to predict the frequency of potential wake alerts. A wake alert is defined as an event in which the trailing …",10
Runway landing safety analysis: A case study of Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,"Yue Xie Yue Xie, John Shortle, George Donohue",2003/10/12,"Conference Digital Avionics Systems Conference, 2003. DASC'03. The 22nd","According to historical data, aircraft are subject to a higher accident risk during the landing phase than during other flight phases. With the growth in air traffic volume evaluating safety during the landing phase is an important problem. This article presents an analysis and estimate of two safety metrics at ATL airport: probability of a simultaneous runway occupancy by two landing aircraft and probability of a collision on the runway. We begin with the first order analysis to estimate the simultaneous runway occupancy probability, based on field observations. To obtain a more accurate estimate and to evaluate the runway collision risk, we construct a stochastic model of the aircraft approaching and landing process. The result of Monte Carlo simulation gives an improved estimate for the simultaneous occupancy probability.

Solutions are provided for special cases, and directions for more general techniques are provided.",10
Improving the nowcast of unstable approaches,"Lance Sherry, John Shortle",2016,Journal 8th International Conference on Research in Air Transportation,"The approach and landing is a complex phase of flight, in which flight crews need to conduct a series of procedures in a condensed time frame to make the approach stable. Unstable approaches can lead to events with reduced safety margins and additional operating cost. To ensure flights have stable approaches, airlines have established stabilized approach criteria to make sure the landing flight is on track, within appropriate range of speed and rate of descent. If the criteria are not satisfied at stabilization altitudes, a go-around must be executed. Nowcasting the likelihood of unstable approaches before reaching the stabilization altitudes may assist flight crews in taking actions to correct the flight trajectory to avoid a potential unstable approach. A previous study shows the feasibility of detecting unstable approaches using historical trajectory data and the feasibility of nowcasting unstable approaches using state variables. This paper describes improvements in the nowcast performance through the modification of existing features and the addition of more features. For the Nowcast at 6 nm for unstable approaches after reaching 1000’AGL, the accuracy was improved from 71.3% to 74.8%, the recall was improved from 60.8% to 64.7%, and the precision was improved from 74.0% to 78.4%.

Efficient simulation of the national airspace system,"John F Shortle, D Gross, Briam L Mark",2003/12/7,Journal WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE,"The National Airspace System (NAS) is a large and complicated system. Detailed simulation models of the NAS are generally quite slow, so it can be difficult to obtain statistically valid samples from such models. This paper presents two methods for reducing the complexity of such networks to improve simulation time. One method is removal of low-utilization queues - that is, replacing a queueing node with a delay node, so that airplanes experience a service time at the node but no queueing time. The other is removal of nodes by clustering - that is, where groups of nodes are collapsed into a single node. We employ the methods on simple networks and show that the reductions yield very little loss in modeling accuracy. We provide some estimates for the potential speedup in simulation time when using the methods on large networks.",9
Feasibility of using historical flight track data to nowcast unstable approaches,"Zhenming Wang, Lance Sherry, John Shortle",2016/4/19,Conference 2016 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance (ICNS),"The approach and landing phase is one of the most complex procedures in airline operations.

If any of these conditions are not satisfied, the flight crew is required to abort the approach adding operational costs to the flight. Nowcasting unstable approaches prior to the stable approach altitudes (e.g. at 10 nm, 6 nm from the runway threshold) could provide lead time for flight crew to make adjustments to avoid a potential unstable approach.

Statistical separation standards for the aircraft-approach process,"Babak G Jeddi, John F Shortle, Lance Sherry",2006/10/15,Conference 2006 ieee/aiaa 25TH Digital Avionics Systems Conference,"Demand for air transportation has been increasing. A response to this is enhancing the runway utilization and throughput before investing on new runways or instruments. Runway throughput can be increased by reducing in-trail landing separation between aircraft, but the consequence may be an increase in the chance of a severe wake vortex encounter or a simultaneous runway occupancy (or go-around). Current instrument flight rule (IFR) standards provide fixed separation minima for given pairs of wake vortex weight classes of aircraft. In practice, the observed separation is a random variable and fluctuates near or above the specified minimum. In this paper, we propose a framework for statistical separation standards that specifies not only a lower bound for the separation but also a standard for the target value and the variance of the process.

Rare event simulation for potential wake encounters,"Azin Zare-Noghabi, John F Shortle",2017/12/3,Conference 2017 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC),"A flying aircraft produces two coherent rotating vortices of air in its trail.

As new procedures and technologies are proposed to increase the capacity of the airspace, rare-event simulation is necessary to evaluate to the safety of proposed changes. This paper explores the performance of a rare-event splitting technique in the context of estimating probabilities of potential wake encounters. The goal is to identify good strategies for the splitting method while using a relatively simple model for the wakes.

The remaining nodes are collapsed into a reduced set of nodes, in an effort to approximate the flows into and out of the set of core nodes. The core nodes and their interactions are preserved in the reduced network. We test the network reductions for accuracy and speed.

Piecewise polynomial approximations for heavy-tailed distributions in queueing analysis,John F Shortle,2005/2/9,Journal Stochastic models,"A basic difficulty in dealing with heavy-tailed distributions is that they may not have explicit Laplace transforms. This makes numerical methods that use the Laplace transform more challenging. This paper generalizes an existing method for approximating heavy-tailed distributions, for use in queueing analysis. The generalization involves fitting Chebyshev polynomials to a probability density function g(t) at specified points t 1, t 2, …, t  N . By choosing points t  i , which rapidly get far out in the tail, it is possible to capture the tail behavior with relatively few points, and to control the relative error in the approximation.

Safety comparison of centralized and distributed aircraft separation assurance concepts,"John Shortle, Yimin Zhang",2014/1/16,Journal IEEE Transactions on Reliability,"This paper presents several models to compare centralized and distributed automated separation assurance concepts in aviation. In a centralized system, safety-related functions are implemented by common equipment on the ground. In a distributed system, safety-related functions are implemented by equipment on each aircraft. Failures of the safety-related functions can increase the risk of near mid-air collisions. Intuitively, failures on the ground are worse than failures in the air because the ground failures simultaneously affect multiple aircraft. This paper evaluates the degree to which this belief is true. Using region-wide models to account for dependencies between aircraft pairs, we derive the region-wide expectation and variance of the number of separation losses for both centralized and distributed concepts.

The analysis showed that excessive gate-waiting delays are a rare phenomenon. There were 12 of the 92 days in which the significant gate-waiting delays occurred (ie total daily gate-waiting delays greater than 12 hours). The gate-waiting delays can be attributed to:(1) a disrupted arrival schedule resulting in compressed arrivals in excess of the gate availability on 8 of the 12 days,(2) gate occupancy times in excess of scheduled turn-around time on 1 of the 12 days,(3) unused gate capacity when aircraft are waiting for gates on all 12 days.

Application of common cause failure methodology to aviation safety assessment model,"Seungwon Noh, John Shortle",2016,Conference Proceedings of the International Conference on Research in Air Transportation,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been developing the Integrated Safety Assessment Model (ISAM) to provide a baseline risk assessment for the National Airspace System and to evaluate the safety impact of proposed changes to the system.

However many basic events throughout the model appear with the same descriptive label. Such events might have some dependence, rather than being completely independent as is currently assumed. This paper evaluates the dependency between basic events having the same label in order to see the overall impact on accident risk. A common cause failure (CCF) methodology is applied to the event sequence diagrams (ESDs) in ISAM. A modified beta-factor model is applied, and a binary decision diagram method is implemented to evaluate end-state frequencies of an ESD.

Sensitivity analysis of rare-event splitting applied to cascading blackout models,"John Shortle, Chun-Hung Chen",2013/12/8,Conference 2013 Winter Simulations Conference (WSC),"Splitting is a technique that can be used to improve the efficiency in simulating rare events.

We specifically consider a two-level fixed-effort variation of splitting for which analytic results can be derived. Results are applied to a simple model of cascading blackouts.

Capacity analysis for a flow corridor with dynamic wake separation,"Azin Zare-Noghabi, John Shortle",2021/12/12,Conference 2021 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC),This paper gives a simulation framework to investigate the capacity benefits of employing a dynamic wake separation policy in a single lane flow corridor. The flow corridor concept is a proposed route structure in en-route airspace to increase capacity in response to growing demand. Aircraft flying in a flow corridor must be safely separated to avoid collisions as well as wake vortex encounters. Wake vortices are circular patterns of rotating air left behind a wing as it generates lift and can impose a hazard to other aircraft. This research considers a dynamic wake separation concept that uses information about weight and airspeed of aircraft and meteorological conditions to determine the minimum required wake separation between aircraft in a flow corridor. This is in contrast to a static policy that uses a fixed separation minimum based on conservative assumptions. The simulation results demonstrate capacity benefits …,
Exploration of Control Chart Capabilities to Distinguish Random and Anomalous Rare-Events Patterns in Aviation Incident Data,"Oleksandra S Donnelly, John F Shortle",2021,Source Transportation Research Board 100th Annual MeetingTransportation Research BoardTransportation Research Board,"Aviation is an extremely safe mode of transportation. Incidents and accidents are rare. As a result, time-series plots of incident counts may have a high variance, fluctuating up and down. It may be difficult to know whether sudden changes in the incident counts represent fundamental underlying changes in the National Airspace System (assignable causes) or are just attributable to noise (chance causes). Control charts have been widely used in manufacturing to help differentiate between these two types of causes. This paper implements and applies a control-chart methodology to aviation incident and accident data. While standard control charts are based on the assumption of normally distributed data, rare-event counts often follow a Poisson distribution. This paper uses both a standard (normal-based) control chart as well as a Poisson-based control chart.

Uncertainty Importance Analysis for Aviation Event Trees,"John Shortle, Seungwon Noh",2019/4/9,"Conference 2019 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","Event trees are often used in the assessment of aviation safety.

The objective of this paper is to identify the most critical nodes in an event tree with respect to their potential for reducing the overall uncertainty of the model. To do this, an uncertainty important metric from the literature is applied. The metric answers the question: If one were able to know the exact value of a parameter, say, through a large data collection effort, how much would the overall uncertainty of the model improve and which parameter would lead to the best uncertainty improvement?

Multi-objective Evaluation of Various Target Separation Standards for Flow Corridor Based on TOPSIS and Entropy,"Bojia Ye, Zhao Yang, John F Shortle, Lance Sherry",2017,Source Transportation Research Board 96th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"This study presents a procedure for evaluating various target separation standards for a parallel-lane flow corridor considering multiple performance measures, including air traffic operations, corridor capacity, safety and environmental impacts. Simulation models were established using the User Manual for the Base of Aircraft Data published by EUROCONTROL. A self-separation flow corridor segment simulation model with two parallel lanes were used to evaluate the operational and environmental impacts of various target separation standards for consecutive aircraft in the flow corridor. For a particular target separation standard, the operational impact was measured using the total control delay to the aircraft in the corridor. The corridor capacity was calculated as the average aircraft throughput per hour. The safety impact was measured using the corridor breakout rate. The aircraft CO₂ emissions were considered as the environmental impact measurement. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) entropy evaluation method was then used to rank the performances of various target separations considering multiple performance measures. It was found that combining multiple objectives in decision making one may obtain different results with regard to the optimum target separation standard.

In this study, we apply such tools in managing landing operations on runways (as the bottleneck and highly valuable resources of air transportation networks) to handle its optimal and safe usage. We consider a uniform aircraft fleet mix landing on a runway with two major landing risks of wake-vortex encounter and simultaneous runway occupancy. Here, we empirically estimate minimum safe wake-vortex separation thresholds, extend go-around procedure to avoid wake-vortex encounter, and enforce the go-arounds assumed to be risk free. We introduce cost-benefit factors to study implications of enforced go-arounds, and develop models to adjust the average separation to maximize the net economic outcome. This also estimates the runway’s true landing capacity, and provides a ground for quantifying effect of separation variance on optimal throughput. An estimation of the economic effect of wake-vortex phenomenon is also presented. Illustrations are provided through real world data.",

A generalized framework for probabilistic design with application to rotors,"John F Shortle, Max B Mendel",2006/3/6,Journal IEEE Transactions on Reliability,"This paper generalizes an existing method for deriving probability models of manufacturing quality metrics. We specifically consider the problem of deriving probability models for the inertia tensor of a rotor.

The key contribution of this paper is that the quality metric of interest is a matrix or a second-order tensor, and the various manufacturing imperfections that cause deviations in the inertia tensor may be vectors. Existing methods, by contrast, assume that the quality metric, as well as the manufacturing imperfections, are scalar quantities.

Department zyxwvutsrqponml,"Yue Xie, John Shortle, George Donohue","The inevitable increase in air traffic demand occurs in an environment that is still operating under some of the zyxwvutsrqponmlkj rules that were designed and implemented after World War 11. Current air traffic management has become more complex and more challenging, especially in terminal area operations. Since it is difficult to extend the current infrastructure to accommodate the growing demand (for example, by adding a runway), an altemative for increasing capacity at airports is to fly aircraft closer to each other. However, this raises the issue of safety.","Scholar articles Department zyxwvutsrqponmlY Xie, J Shortle, G DonohueRelated articles ","The inevitable increase in air traffic demand occurs in an environment that is still operating under some of the zyxwvutsrqponmlkj rules that were designed and implemented after World War 11.

Online Appendix to: Reduction of Closed Queueing Networks for Efficient Simulation,"JOHN F SHORTLE, BRIAN L MARK, DONALD GROSS","Table I shows parameters for a 12-node network. The routing probabilities were obtained from flight data over a one-month period at 12 airports. Specifically, pi, j∝ ni, j, where ni, j is the observed count of flights from airport i to airport j. This network is intended for illustration, not to actually model the air transportation system. The first four nodes represent major airports, while the remaining nodes represent moderately sized airports. A natural choice for C is {1, 2, 3, 4}. The remaining network parameters are chosen somewhat arbitrarily: the number of customers (airplanes) in the system is M= 120; the service parameters μi and c2 si, are given in the table. Table II shows the approximate queueing metrics obtained using Algorithm A. Table III shows the results of Reduction 1 applied to the sample network. Table IV shows the results of Reduction 2 to the sample network.
