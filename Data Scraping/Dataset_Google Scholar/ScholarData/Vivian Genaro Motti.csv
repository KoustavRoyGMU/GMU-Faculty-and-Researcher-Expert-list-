"Users’ Privacy Concerns About Wearables: impact of form factor, sensors and type of data collected","Vivian Genaro Motti, Kelly Caine",2015,Conference 1st Workshop on Wearable Security and Privacy,"Wearables have become popular in several application domains, including healthcare, entertainment and security. Their pervasiveness, small size and autonomy, enlarges the potential of these devices to be employed in different activities and scenarios. Wearable devices collect data ubiquitously and continuously, about the individual user and also her surroundings, which can pose many privacy challenges that neither users nor stakeholders are ready to deal with. Before designing effective solutions for developing privacy-enhanced wearables, we need first to identify and understand what are the potential privacy concerns that users have and how they are perceived. To contribute to that purpose, in this paper we present findings from a qualitative content analysis of online comments regarding privacy concerns of wearable device users. We also discuss how form factors, sensors employed, and the type …",204
Human Factors Considerations in the Design of Wearable Devices,"Vivian Genaro Motti, Kelly Caine",2014/9/1,Journal Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting,"Wearable devices have great potential to support several application domains ranging from medical and safety critical, to leisure and entertainment. Wearable devices’ solutions are promising, and extensive research has been conducted in this domain since the early 90’s. However most of these works focuses on the feasibility of individual solutions. As such, the human aspects are often neglected, which can decrease not only the acceptance levels for novel devices, but also their sustained engagement. To facilitate the consideration of human factors in the early design stage, we present and define a list of 20 human-centered design principles. We explain how each principle can be incorporated during the design phase of the wearable device creation process. By adopting these principles, we expect practitioners to achieve better wearable solutions, improving the user acceptance, satisfaction and engagement for …",174

This framework consists of: a meta-model for understanding fundamental concepts required by adaptation, a reference framework for characterizing seven dimensions for conducting adaptation based on the meta-model, and a design space for consistently assessing the adaptation coverage. In this way, development phases are considered with a standard approach, a unified terminology, and an extensive catalog of techniques.",63
Showing user interface adaptivity by animated transitions,"Charles-Eric Dessart, Vivian Genaro Motti, Jean Vanderdonckt",2011/6/13,Journal Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGCHI symposium on Engineering interactive computing systems,"In order to reduce the inevitable end user disruption and cognitive perturbation induced by adapting a graphical user interface, the results of the adaptation could be conveyed to the end user by animating a transition scenario showing the evolution from the user interface before adaptation to the user interface after adaptation. A transition scenario consists of a sequence of adaptation operations (e.g., set/change a property of a widget, replace a widget by another, resize a widget) belonging to a catalogue of operations defined as an Extended Backus-Naur Form grammar. Each transition operation has a range from a single widget (e.g., this Ok button) to a selection of widgets based on a selector mechanism (e.g., all validation widgets of this family of interfaces). A transition scenario is built either automatically by any adaptation algorithm or interactively by a specific editor for designers. An animator then executes the …",51

Animated transitions between user interface views,"Charles-Eric Dessart, Vivian Genaro Motti, Jean Vanderdonckt",2012/5/21,Conference Proceedings of the International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces,"User interface development life cycle often involve several different views of the user interface over time either at the same level of abstraction or at different levels of abstraction. The relationship between these different views is often supported by tiling coordinated windows containing these related views simultaneously, thus leaving the developer with the responsibility to effectively and efficiently link the corresponding elements of these different views. This paper attempts to overcome the shortcomings posed by the coordinated visualization of multiple views by providing UsiView, a user interface rendering engine in which one single window ensures an animated transition between these different user interface views dynamically an internal view, an external view, and a conceptual view.

A computational framework for multi-dimensional context-aware adaptation,Vivian Genaro Motti,2011/6/13,Conference Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGCHI symposium on Engineering interactive computing systems,"Most interactive applications often assume a pre-defined context of use of an able-bodied user, a desktop platform, in a stable environment. In contrast, users compose a heterogeneous group, interacting via different means and devices in varied environments; which requires, thus, context-aware adaptation. Adaptation has been largely investigated, but the studies are often constrained to one context dimension at a time: user or platform or environment. To address this issue and to bridge the gap between high-level adaptation goals and implementation of adaptation, this research aims at developing a computational framework for user interface adaptation based on distinct dimensions and contexts of use. This framework consists of four main contributions: a design space to characterize context-aware adaptation of user interface, a reference framework to classify adaptation techniques for distinct scenarios, an …",19
Design Recommendations to Improve the User Interaction with Wrist Worn Devices,"Byron Lowens, Vivian Motti, Kelly Caine",2015,Conference WristSense 2015: Workshop on Sensing Systems and Applications Using Wrist Worn Smart Devices,"Wrist worn devices (WWDs) including fitness trackers and smart watches have been successfully employed to support various applications, ranging from gesture recognition to authentication.

Machine Learning in the Support of Context-Aware Adaptation,"Vivian GENARO MOTTI, Nesrine Mezhoudi, Jean Vanderdonckt",2012,Conference Workshop on Context-Aware Adaptation of Service Front-Ends,"Adapting user interfaces according to the context of use aims at improving the usability levels of an application and enhancing the user experience, mainly by optimizing the users’ interaction and reducing their errors. However, given the significant amount of information involved, adapting UIs often demands complex inferences. Because the context information is extensive, it is hard to prioritize it to decide the best adaptation techniques. Moreover, dealing with recurrent trade-offs, eg adaptability vs. performance, is not simple. To aid the adaptation decisions, machine learning algorithms can be applied to support reasoning, inferences and also to deal with complex or fuzzy information.

For 46 women commuters in the Washington, DC metro area, we measured personal exposure to PM 2.5 during all vehicle trips taken in a 48-h sampling period. We also measured 48-h integrated PM 2.5 chemical constituents including black carbon and zinc. We identified trip times using vehicle monitors, specifically on-board diagnostics data loggers and dashboard cameras.

Designing technologies for neurodiverse users: considerations from research practice,"Vivian Genaro Motti, Anna Evmenova",2020,"Conference Human Interaction and Emerging Technologies: Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Human Interaction and Emerging Technologies (IHIET 2019), August 22-24, 2019, Nice, France","This paper presents and discusses the perspectives of ten investigators experienced with design of technologies for and with neurodiverse users. Although the advances on emerging technologies improved their potential to assist users with neurodiverse needs, existing methods for participatory design, usability tests and evaluation have been created for, and validated with, able-bodied users. User-centered design methods are not always well-suited to meet the unique needs of neurodiverse individuals. Therefore, to involve neurodiverse users iteratively in the design process, investigators need to adapt traditional methods from HCI to successfully conduct user studies. Through an online questionnaire, we identified the experimental designs commonly adopted and the major problems investigators face during recruitment, data collection, analysis and design.

Smartwatch Applications for Mental Health: A Qualitative Analysis of Users’ Perspectives,Vivian Genaro Motti,2018,Conference 3rd Symposium on Computing and Mental Health,"Wearable applications have a large potential to facilitate healthcare solutions in numerous domains. Smartwatches specifically, by being small, unobtrusive and collecting data continuously, are able to monitor users’ activities and detect behavioral patterns. Besides enabling the analysis of users’ data, smartwatch application can also provide prompt interventions when necessary. Through timely notifications, discreet alerts and emergency response, wrist-worn devices become versatile solutions that are able to accommodating requirements from several medical solutions. For mental health specifically, smartwatch applications provide numerous affordances. Their characterization is still unclear though. To understand how smartwatch applications have been appropriated as wearable solutions for mental health, we preformed a qualitative analysis of users’ reviews and online discussions about existing applications in iTunes and Android Market. Most applications focus on interventions, rather than monitoring. They rely on multimodal contents to provide features. End users see benefits of these apps on the effectiveness of the interventions and customization features. Main drawbacks of existing applications are related to the lack of efficient privacy controls (exploitation by third-parties), early-stage designs (incompatibility and issues with updates) and limited features. In this paper, we discuss current solutions under the light of user experience, features available as well as the potential opportunities for future designs.",4

TriPlet: A Conceptual Framework for Multidimensional Adaptation of User Interfaces to the Context of Use,Vivian Genaro Motti,2014/1/16,Publisher Presses universitaires de Louvain,"Interactive systems often consider for interaction a single context of use of an able-bodied user with a desktop PC in a stable environment. Conversely, users are heterogeneous, interact with different devices in different environments, and require context-aware adaptation (CAA). Although adaptation has been largely studied since the 90's, its study has been constrained, eg by considering one aspect of the context (ie user, platform or environment), or by handling dimensions in a limited approach with simple rules, or by adapting one system aspect (as content or presentation). Moreover, the users benefit not always is a priority, making them lost or without control over the adaptation. Existing frameworks about CAA are often technologically driven, narrow in scope or obsolete. Due to these shortcomings, stakeholders have not enough support during the development of CAA. To address these issues and to bridge the gap between high-level adaptation goals and implementation of adaptation techniques, this thesis presents a conceptual framework for user interface adaptation, joining dimensions that compose the variety of contexts of use through users, platforms, and environments, and the variety of aspects of an interactive system, including contents, presentation and navigation. This framework, named TriPlet, is structured in three elements: a meta-model (CAMM) covering the whole CAA lifecycle, its concepts and properties, a reference framework (CARF) that extensively defines adaptation concepts to support design decisions, and a design space (CADS) for assessing CAA levels with well-defined criteria.",2

""" A Unified Model for Context-aware Adaptation of User Interfaces","Vivian Genaro Motti, Jean Vanderdonckt",2013,Journal Revista Română de Interacţiune Om-Calculator,"The variety of contexts of use in which the interaction takes place nowadays is a challenge for both stakeholders for the development and end users for the interaction. Stakeholders either ignore the exponential amount of information coming from the context of use, adopting the inaccessible approach of one-size-fits-all, or they must dedicate a significant effort to carefully consider context differences while designing several different versions of the same user interface. For end users, web pages that are not adapted become often inaccessible in non-conventional contexts of use, with mobile devices, as smart phones and tablet PCs. In order to leverage such efforts, we propose in this paper a meta-model that by means of a unified view supports all phases of the implementation of context-aware adaptation for user interfaces.

""" A Unified Model for Context-aware Adaptation of User Interfaces","Vivian Genaro Motti, Jean Vanderdonckt",2013,Journal Revista Română de Interacţiune Om-Calculator,"The variety of contexts of use in which the interaction takes place nowadays is a challenge for both stakeholders for the development and end users for the interaction. Stakeholders either ignore the exponential amount of information coming from the context of use, adopting the inaccessible approach of one-size-fits-all, or they must dedicate a significant effort to carefully consider context differences while designing several different versions of the same user interface. For end users, web pages that are not adapted become often inaccessible in non-conventional contexts of use, with mobile devices, as smart phones and tablet PCs. In order to leverage such efforts, we propose in this paper a meta-model that by means of a unified view supports all phases of the implementation of context-aware adaptation for user interfaces. With such a formal abstraction of an interactive system, stakeholders can generate different instantiations with more concrete UI’s that can properly handle and adapt accordingly to the different constraints and characteristics of different contexts of use.

A Study of User Concerns about Smartphone Privacy,"Carol Fung, Vivian Motti, Katie Zhang, Yanjun Qian",2022/10/24,Conference 2022 6th Cyber Security in Networking Conference (CSNet),"The widespread adoption of mobile devices, including smartphones, wearables, and the Internet of Things, fostered the potential for data collection and online sharing on a large scale. End users are enthusiastic about the opportunities to share information about their daily activities with their peers using novel devices. Still, there is a growing concern about their privacy. To devise privacy-enhancing technologies that meet users' needs, a better understanding of users' concerns and practices is needed. For that, we applied an online survey to 1,000 participants. We analyze their responses and in this paper we discuss the end users' perspective on mobile privacy, further eliciting the gaps of the Privacy Paradox. The results show that although users state privacy concerns, they do not always act to protect their privacy in mobile apps. Certain privacy actions tend to be more often considered by users.

At times these solutions have been outright oppressive. Assets-based design could enable a shift toward interdependent relationships, centering the wholeness of an individual rather than fixing gaps in personhood. Two issues stand out as raising important, open questions for disability justice in HCI: 1) challenges in assets when hegemonic biases and power differentials exist, and 2) the use of existing methodologies and theories prevalent in disability justice studies together with assets-based design. Designers’ biases are a key aspect defining their roles and practices in assets-based design endeavors. Bias is defined as a tendency in design to …",

The adaptation profile expresses who is responsible for ensuring each adaptation cycle: one or several end users, one or several machine agents, one or many third parties, and any combination of the former. The adaptation design space expresses seven key dimensions along which adaptation can be decided and designed: autonomy level, granularity level, task resuming granularity, user interface deployment, technological space coverage, user feedback, and modality. Some examples are included to illustrate how to use this profile and design space for two systems ensuring user interface adaptation to some extent.",

Context aware adaptation of user interfaces,Jean Vanderdonckt,2013/7/1,Journal International Journal of User-System Interaction,Context-aware Adaptation (CAA) of user interfaces involves the identification of the relevant context information that surrounds the user during her interaction in order to properly adapt elements of an interactive system aiming at enhancing the end user interaction. The main goals of CAA are improving the usability levels of the system by using the relevant information of the user context to properly transform a system. In this special issue the authors are presenting various model-based approaches to user interface design and evaluation aiming to support the context aware adaptation.,

Moreover, stakeholders cannot count on existing UI editors once they usually do not provide support for context-aware adaptation.

To support the design of user interfaces that are properly adapted to their target context, this paper proposes a novel methodology to enhance sketching activities by suggesting to the end user adaptation guidelines.

TriPlet: a conceptual framework for multidimensional adaptation of user interfaces to the context of use,Vivian Genaro Motti,2013,Institution UCL-Université Catholique de Louvain,"The existing interactive systems tend to still consider a predefined context of use for interaction. Stakeholders mainly consider able-bodied users, desktop platforms, and stable environments. Conversely, users compose a heterogeneous group. They interact using different modalities and devices in distinct environments, which requires appropriate context-aware adaptations. Although adaptation has been largely investigated since the early 90’s, its study has been often constrained. For instance by considering just one dimension of the context of use (ie user, platform or environment), by expressing and handling these dimensions in a restrictive approach by using only simple rules, by adapting just one aspect of an interactive system (ie content, presentation or navigation). Moreover, the end user benefit not always has the highest priority, making end users lost or without control over the adaptation. The existing frameworks about context-aware adaptation (CAA) are usually technologically driven, narrow in scope or obsolete. Due to these shortcomings, stakeholders have no unified support to rely on during the whole development lifecycle of context-aware adaptation. In order to address these main issues and aiming to bridge the gap between high-level adaptation goals and implementation of adaptation techniques, this thesis presents a conceptual framework for user interface adaptation that integrates the several dimensions that simultaneously compose the diversity of contexts of use through users, platforms, and environments, and the diversity of aspects of an interacti...",

Today the significant heterogeneity of contexts of use, given mainly by the diversity of devices and the easier access to technology, enables an interaction from many distinct environments and covers different application domains and users’ profiles.

GISATIE: A User Interface Adaptation Life-Cycle,"Víctor López-Jaquero, Vivian Genaro Motti, Francisco Montero, Pascual González López","Adapting the User Interface of an interactive application consists in modifying its different elements according to various levels of granularity. Adaptation aims at addressing specific needs, wishes, and requirements either of a particular user or a group of users. While user interface adaptation has been extensively studied, in particular for context awareness, one of the most widely used adaptation life cycles is Dieterich’s survey of adaptation techniques. This survey considers only the execution part of the adaptation lifecycle and involves only one actor, user or system, in each adaptation stage. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce GISATIE, a user interface adaptation life-cycle specifying which agents are involved in each adaptation stage: goals, initiative, specification, application, transition, interpretation, and evaluation.","Scholar articles GISATIE: A User Interface Adaptation Life-CycleV López-Jaquero, VG Motti, F Montero, PG LópezRelated articles ","Adapting the User Interface of an interactive application consists in modifying its different elements according to various levels of granularity.
