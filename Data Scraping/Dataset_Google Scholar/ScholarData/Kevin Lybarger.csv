Extracting COVID-19 diagnoses and symptoms from clinical text: A new annotated corpus and neural event extraction framework,"Kevin Lybarger, Mari Ostendorf, Matthew Thompson, Meliha Yetisgen",2021/5/1,Journal Journal of Biomedical Informatics,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Although much has been learned about the novel coronavirus since its emergence, there are many open questions related to tracking its spread, describing symptomology, predicting the severity of infection, and forecasting healthcare utilization. Free-text clinical notes contain critical information for resolving these questions. Data-driven, automatic information extraction models are needed to use this text-encoded information in large-scale studies. This work presents a new clinical corpus, referred to as the COVID-19 Annotated Clinical Text (CACT) Corpus, which comprises 1,472 notes with detailed annotations characterizing COVID-19 diagnoses, testing, and clinical presentation. We introduce a span-based event extraction model that jointly extracts all annotated phenomena, achieving high performance in identifying COVID-19 and symptom events …",31

Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Programs: Multidisciplinary Projects with Homes in Any Discipline,"Jocelyn Cullers, William L Hughes, Donna C Llewellyn",2017,"Description A survey of papers in the ASEE Multidisciplinary Engineering Division over the last three years shows three main areas of emphasis: individual courses; profiles of specific projects; and capstone design courses. However, propagating multidisciplinary education across the vast majority of disciplines offered at educational institutions with varying missions requires models that are independent of the disciplines, programs, and institutions in which they were originally conceived. Further, models that can propagate must be cost effective, scalable, and engage and benefit participating faculty. Since 2015, a consortium of twenty-four institutions has come together around one such model, the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program. VIP unites undergraduate education and faculty research in a team-based context, with students earning academic credits toward their degrees, and faculty and graduate students benefitting from the design/discovery efforts of their multidisciplinary teams.

Using neural multi-task learning to extract substance abuse information from clinical notes,"Kevin Lybarger, Meliha Yetisgen, Mari Ostendorf",2018,Journal AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,"Substance abuse carries many negative health consequences. Detailed information about patients’ substance abuse history is usually captured in free-text clinical notes. Automatic extraction of substance abuse information is vital to assess patients’ risk for developing certain diseases and adverse outcomes. We introduce a novel neural architecture to automatically extract substance abuse information. The model, which uses multi-task learning, outperformed previous work and several baselines created using discrete models. The classifier obtained 0.88-0.95 F1 for detecting substance abuse status (current, none, past, unknown) on a withheld test set. Other substance abuse entities (amount, frequency, exposure history, quit history, and type) were also extracted with high-performance.

Automatically detecting likely edits in clinical notes created using automatic speech recognition,"Kevin Lybarger, Mari Ostendorf, Meliha Yetisgen",2017,Journal AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,"The use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) to create clinical notes has the potential to reduce costs associated with note creation for electronic medical records, but at current system accuracy levels, post-editing by practitioners is needed to ensure note quality. Aiming to reduce the time required to edit ASR transcripts, this paper investigates novel methods for automatic detection of edit regions within the transcripts, including both putative ASR errors but also regions that are targets for cleanup or rephrasing. We create detection models using logistic regression and conditional random field models, exploring a variety of text-based features that consider the structure of clinical notes and exploit the medical context. Different medical text resources are used to improve feature extraction.

Symptoms and signs of lung cancer prior to diagnosis: Comparative study using electronic health records,"Matthew J Thompson, Maria G Prado, Larry G Kessler, Margaret A Au, Hannah A Burkhardt, Monica Zigman Suchsland, Lesleigh Kowalski, Kari A Stephens, Meliha Yetisgen, Fiona M Walter, Richard D Neal, Kevin Lybarger, Caroline A Thompson, Morhaf Al Achkar, Elizabeth A Sarma, Grace Turner, Farhood Farjah",2022,Journal medRxiv,"Background:  Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States (US), with most patients diagnosed at later stages (3 or 4). While most patients are diagnosed following symptomatic presentation, no studies have compared symptoms and physical examination signs at or prior to diagnosis from electronic health records (EHR) in the United States (US). Objective: To identify symptoms and signs in patients prior to lung cancer diagnosis in EHR data. Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: We studied 698 primary lung cancer cases in adults diagnosed between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2019, and 6,841 controls matched by age, sex, smoking status, and type of clinic. Coded and free-text data from the EHR were extracted from 2 years prior to diagnosis date for cases and index date for controls. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression were used to identify symptoms and signs associated with lung cancer. Analyses were repeated excluding symptom data from 1, 3, 6, and 12 months before the diagnosis/index dates.  Results: Eleven symptoms and signs recorded during the study period were associated with a significantly higher chance of being a lung cancer case in multivariate analyses. Of these, seven were significantly associated with lung cancer six months prior to diagnosis: hemoptysis (OR 3.2, 95%CI 1.9-5.3), cough (OR 3.1, 95%CI 2.4-4.0), chest crackles or wheeze (OR 3.1, 95%CI 2.3-4.1), bone pain (OR 2.7, 95%CI 2.1-3.6), back pain (OR 2.5, 95%CI 1.9-3.2), weight loss (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.5-2.8) and fatigue (OR 1.6, 95%CI 1.3-2.1).

We describe the pre-diagnostic time intervals among a retrospective cohort of 711 patients identified with primary lung cancer from 2012–2019 from ambulatory care clinics in Seattle, Washington USA. Electronic health record data were extracted for two years prior to diagnosis, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to identify symptoms/signs from free text clinical fields. Time points were defined for initial symptomatic presentation, chest imaging, specialist consultation, diagnostic confirmation, and treatment initiation. Median and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated for intervals spanning these time points. The mean age of the cohort was 67.3 years, 54.1% had Stage III or IV disease and the majority were diagnosed after clinical presentation (94.5%) rather than screening (5.5%). Median intervals from first recorded symptoms/signs to diagnosis was 570 days (IQR 273–691), from chest CT or chest X-ray imaging to diagnosis 43 days (IQR 11–240), specialist consultation to diagnosis 72 days (IQR 13–456), and from diagnosis to treatment initiation 7 days (IQR 0–36). Symptoms/signs associated with lung cancer can be identified over a year prior to diagnosis using NLP, highlighting the need for CQMs to improve timeliness of diagnosis.",1
Extracting Radiological Findings With Normalized Anatomical Information Using a Span-Based BERT Relation Extraction Model,"Kevin Lybarger, Aashka Damani, Martin Gunn, Meliha Yetisgen",2022,Journal AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,"Medical imaging is critical to the diagnosis and treatment of numerous medical problems, including many forms of cancer. Medical imaging reports distill the findings and observations of radiologists, creating an unstructured textual representation of unstructured medical images. Large-scale use of this text-encoded information requires converting the unstructured text to a structured, semantic representation. We explore the extraction and normalization of anatomical information in radiology reports that is associated with radiological findings. We investigate this extraction and normalization task using a span-based relation extraction model that jointly extracts entities and relations using BERT. This work examines the factors that influence extraction and normalization performance, including the body part/organ system, frequency of occurrence, span length, and span diversity.

Asynchronous speech recognition affects physician editing of notes,"Kevin J Lybarger, Mari Ostendorf, Eve Riskin, Thomas H Payne, Andrew A White, Meliha Yetisgen",2018/10,Journal Applied Clinical Informatics," Objective Clinician progress notes are an important record for care and communication, but there is a perception that electronic notes take too long to write and may not accurately reflect the patient encounter, threatening quality of care. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has the potential to improve clinical documentation process; however, ASR inaccuracy and editing time are barriers to wider use. We hypothesized that automatic text processing technologies could decrease editing time and improve note quality. To inform the development of these technologies, we studied how physicians create clinical notes using ASR and analyzed note content that is revised or added during asynchronous editing.",1

Generalizing through Forgetting--Domain Generalization for Symptom Event Extraction in Clinical Notes,"Sitong Zhou, Kevin Lybarger, Meliha Yetisgen Mari Ostendorf",2022/9/20,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.09485,"Symptom information is primarily documented in free-text clinical notes and is not directly accessible for downstream applications. To address this challenge, information extraction approaches that can handle clinical language variation across different institutions and specialties are needed. In this paper, we present domain generalization for symptom extraction using pretraining and fine-tuning data that differs from the target domain in terms of institution and/or specialty and patient population. We extract symptom events using a transformer-based joint entity and relation extraction method. To reduce reliance on domain-specific features, we propose a domain generalization method that dynamically masks frequent symptoms words in the source domain. Additionally, we pretrain the transformer language model (LM) on task-related unlabeled texts for better representation. Our experiments indicate that masking and adaptive pretraining methods can significantly improve performance when the source domain is more distant from the target domain.",

Improving Classification of Infrequent Cognitive Distortions: Domain-Specific Model vs. Data Augmentation,"Xiruo Ding, Kevin Lybarger, Justin Tauscher, Trevor Cohen",2022/7,Conference Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies: Student Research Workshop,"Cognitive distortions are counterproductive patterns of thinking that are one of the targets of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). These can be challenging for clinicians to detect, especially those without extensive CBT training or supervision. Text classification methods can approximate expert clinician judgment in the detection of frequently occurring cognitive distortions in text-based therapy messages. However, performance with infrequent distortions is relatively poor. In this study, we address this sparsity problem with two approaches: Data Augmentation and Domain-Specific Model. The first approach includes Easy Data Augmentation, back translation, and mixup techniques. The second approach utilizes a domain-specific pretrained language model, MentalBERT. To examine the viability of different data augmentation methods, we utilized a real-world dataset of texts between therapists and clients diagnosed with serious mental illness that was annotated for distorted thinking. We found that with optimized parameter settings, mixup was helpful for rare classes. Performance improvements with an augmented model, MentalBERT, exceed those obtained with data augmentation.",
Identifying Distorted Thinking in Patient-Therapist Text Message Exchanges by Leveraging Dynamic Multi-Turn Context,"Kevin Lybarger, Justin Tauscher, Xiruo Ding, Dror Ben-Zeev, Trevor Cohen",2022/7,Conference Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology,"There is growing evidence that mobile text message exchanges between patients and therapists can augment traditional cognitive behavioral therapy. The automatic characterization of patient thinking patterns in this asynchronous text communication may guide treatment and assist in therapist training. In this work, we automatically identify distorted thinking in text-based patient-therapist exchanges, investigating the role of conversation history (context) in distortion prediction. We identify six unique types of cognitive distortions and utilize BERT-based architectures to represent text messages within the context of the conversation. We propose two approaches for leveraging dynamic conversation context in model training. By representing the text messages within the context of the broader patient-therapist conversation, the models better emulate the therapist’s task of recognizing distorted thoughts. This multi-turn classification approach also leverages the clustering of distorted thinking in the conversation timeline. We demonstrate that including conversation context, including the proposed dynamic context methods, improves distortion prediction performance. The proposed architectures and conversation encoding approaches achieve performance comparable to inter-rater agreement. The presence of any distorted thinking is identified with relatively high performance at 0.73 F1, significantly outperforming the best context-agnostic models (0.68 F1).",
