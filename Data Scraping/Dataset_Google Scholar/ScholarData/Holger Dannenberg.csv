Synergy of direct and indirect cholinergic septo-hippocampal pathways coordinates firing in hippocampal networks,"Holger Dannenberg, Milan Pabst, Oliver Braganza, Susanne Schoch, Johannes Niediek, Melike Bayraktar, Florian Mormann, Heinz Beck",2015/6/3,Journal Journal of Neuroscience,"The medial septum/diagonal band of Broca complex (MSDB) is a key structure that modulates hippocampal rhythmogenesis. Cholinergic neurons of the MSDB play a central role in generating and pacing theta-band oscillations in the hippocampal formation during exploration, novelty detection, and memory encoding. How precisely cholinergic neurons affect hippocampal network dynamics in vivo, however, has remained elusive. In this study, we show that stimulation of cholinergic MSDB neurons in urethane-anesthetized mice acts on hippocampal networks via two distinct pathways. A direct septo-hippocampal cholinergic projection causes increased firing of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons with concomitantly decreased firing of principal cells. In addition, cholinergic neurons recruit noncholinergic neurons within the MSDB. This indirect pathway is required for hippocampal theta synchronization. Activation of …",124
Specific basal forebrain–cortical cholinergic circuits coordinate cognitive operations,"Laszlo Záborszky, Peter Gombkoto, Peter Varsanyi, Matthew R Gielow, Gina Poe, Lorna W Role, Mala Ananth, Prithviraj Rajebhosale, David A Talmage, Michael E Hasselmo, Holger Dannenberg, Victor H Minces, Andrea A Chiba",2018/10/31,Source Journal of Neuroscience,"Based on recent molecular genetics, as well as functional and quantitative anatomical studies, the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic projections, once viewed as a diffuse system, are emerging as being remarkably specific in connectivity. Acetylcholine (ACh) can rapidly and selectively modulate activity of specific circuits and ACh release can be coordinated in multiple areas that are related to particular aspects of cognitive processing. This review discusses how a combination of multiple new approaches with more established techniques are being used to finally reveal how cholinergic neurons, together with other BF neurons, provide temporal structure for behavior, contribute to local cortical state regulation, and coordinate activity between different functionally related cortical circuits. ACh selectively modulates dynamics for encoding and attention within individual cortical circuits, allows for important transitions during …",113
Astrocyte intermediaries of septal cholinergic modulation in the hippocampus,"Milan Pabst, Oliver Braganza, Holger Dannenberg, Wen Hu, Leonie Pothmann, Jurij Rosen, Istvan Mody, Karen van Loo, Karl Deisseroth, Albert J Becker, Susanne Schoch, Heinz Beck",2016/5/18,Journal Neuron,"The neurotransmitter acetylcholine, derived from the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca complex, has been accorded an important role in hippocampal learning and memory processes. However, the precise mechanisms whereby acetylcholine released from septohippocampal cholinergic neurons acts to modulate hippocampal microcircuits remain unknown. Here, we show that acetylcholine release from cholinergic septohippocampal projections causes a long-lasting GABAergic inhibition of hippocampal dentate granule cells in vivo and in vitro. This inhibition is caused by cholinergic activation of hilar astrocytes, which provide glutamatergic excitation of hilar inhibitory interneurons. These results demonstrate that acetylcholine release can cause slow inhibition of principal neuronal activity via astrocyte intermediaries.",108
Signal regulatory protein-β1: a microglial modulator of phagocytosis in Alzheimer’s disease,"Sadanand Gaikwad, Sergey Larionov, Yiner Wang, Holger Dannenberg, Takashi Matozaki, Alon Monsonego, Dietmar R Thal, Harald Neumann",2009/12/1,Journal The American journal of pathology,"The signal regulatory protein-β1 (SIRPβ1) is a DAP12-associated transmembrane receptor expressed in a subset of hematopoietic cells. Recently, it was shown that peritoneal macrophages express SIRPβ1, which positively regulated phagocytosis. Here, we found that SIRPβ1 was up-regulated and acted as a phagocytic receptor on microglia in amyloid precursor protein J20 (APP/J20) transgenic mice and in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Interferon (IFN)-γ and IFN-β stimulated gene transcription of SIRPβ1 in cultured microglia. Activation of SIRPβ1 on cultured microglia by cross-linking antibodies induced reorganization of the cytoskeleton protein β-actin and suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced gene transcription of tumor necrosis factor-α and nitric oxide synthase-2. Furthermore, activation of SIRPβ1 increased phagocytosis of microsphere beads, neural debris, and fibrillary amyloid-β (Aβ). Phagocytosis …",87
Modulation of hippocampal circuits by muscarinic and nicotinic receptors,"Holger Dannenberg, Kimberly Young, Michael Hasselmo",2017/12/13,Source Frontiers in neural circuits,"This article provides a review of the effects of activation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors on the physiological properties of circuits in the hippocampal formation. Previous articles have described detailed computational hypotheses about the role of cholinergic neuromodulation in enhancing the dynamics for encoding in cortical structures and the role of reduced cholinergic modulation in allowing consolidation of previously encoded information. This article will focus on addressing the broad scope of different modulatory effects observed within hippocampal circuits, highlighting the heterogeneity of cholinergic modulation in terms of the physiological effects of activation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors and the heterogeneity of effects on different subclasses of neurons.",62
Neural mechanisms of navigation involving interactions of cortical and subcortical structures,"James R Hinman, Holger Dannenberg, Andrew S Alexander, Michael E Hasselmo",2018/6/1,Source Journal of neurophysiology,"Animals must perform spatial navigation for a range of different behaviors, including selection of trajectories toward goal locations and foraging for food sources. To serve this function, a number of different brain regions play a role in coding different dimensions of sensory input important for spatial behavior, including the entorhinal cortex, the retrosplenial cortex, the hippocampus, and the medial septum. This article will review data concerning the coding of the spatial aspects of animal behavior, including location of the animal within an environment, the speed of movement, the trajectory of movement, the direction of the head in the environment, and the position of barriers and objects both relative to the animal’s head direction (egocentric) and relative to the layout of the environment (allocentric). The mechanisms for coding these important spatial representations are not yet fully understood but could involve …",34
The firing rate speed code of entorhinal speed cells differs across behaviorally relevant time scales and does not depend on medial septum inputs,"Holger Dannenberg, Craig Kelley, Alec Hoyland, Caitlin K Monaghan, Michael E Hasselmo",2019/5/1,Journal Journal of Neuroscience,"The firing rate of speed cells, a dedicated subpopulation of neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), is correlated with running speed. This correlation has been interpreted as a speed code used in various computational models for path integration. These models consider firing rate to be linearly tuned by running speed in real-time. However, estimation of firing rates requires integration of spiking events over time, setting constraints on the temporal accuracy of the proposed speed code. We therefore tested whether the proposed speed code by firing rate is accurate at short time scales using data obtained from open-field recordings in male rats and mice. We applied a novel filtering approach differentiating between speed codes at multiple time scales ranging from deciseconds to minutes. In addition, we determined the optimal integration time window for firing-rate estimation using a general likelihood …",27

Here, we review recordings from hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex to address the problem of how neurons encode multiple overlapping spatiotemporal trajectories and disambiguate these for accurate memory-guided behaviour. The solution could involve neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus that show mixed selectivity, coding both time and location. Some grid cells and place cells that code space also respond selectively as time cells, allowing differentiation of time intervals when a rat runs in the same location during a delay period. Cells in these regions also develop new representations that differentially code the context of prior or future behaviour allowing disambiguation of overlapping trajectories …",18
Models of spatial and temporal dimensions of memory,"Michael E Hasselmo, James R Hinman, Holger Dannenberg, Chantal E Stern",2017/10/1,Source Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences,"Episodic memory involves coding of the spatial location and time of individual events. Coding of space and time is also relevant to working memory, spatial navigation, and the disambiguation of overlapping memory representations. Neurophysiological data demonstrate that neuronal activity codes the current, past and future location of an animal as well as temporal intervals within a task. Models have addressed how neural coding of space and time for memory function could arise, with both dimensions coded by the same neurons. Neural coding could depend upon network oscillatory and attractor dynamics as well as modulation of neuronal intrinsic properties. These models are relevant to the coding of space and time involving structures including the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, striatum and parahippocampal gyrus, which have been implicated in both animal and human studies.",17
Potential roles of cholinergic modulation in the neural coding of location and movement speed,"Holger Dannenberg, James R Hinman, Michael E Hasselmo",2016/9/1,Source Journal of Physiology-Paris,"Behavioral data suggest that cholinergic modulation may play a role in certain aspects of spatial memory, and neurophysiological data demonstrate neurons that fire in response to spatial dimensions, including grid cells and place cells that respond on the basis of location and running speed. These neurons show firing responses that depend upon the visual configuration of the environment, due to coding in visually-responsive regions of the neocortex. This review focuses on the physiological effects of acetylcholine that may influence the sensory coding of spatial dimensions relevant to behavior. In particular, the local circuit effects of acetylcholine within the cortex regulate the influence of sensory input relative to internal memory representations via presynaptic inhibition of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, and the modulation of intrinsic currents in cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In addition …",14
Effects of visual inputs on neural dynamics for coding of location and running speed in medial entorhinal cortex,"Holger Dannenberg, Hallie Lazaro, Pranav Nambiar, Alec Hoyland, Michael E Hasselmo",2020/12/10,Journal Elife,"Neuronal representations of spatial location and movement speed in the medial entorhinal cortex during the ‘active’ theta state of the brain are important for memory-guided navigation and rely on visual inputs. However, little is known about how visual inputs change neural dynamics as a function of running speed and time. By manipulating visual inputs in mice, we demonstrate that changes in spatial stability of grid cell firing correlate with changes in a proposed speed signal by local field potential theta frequency. In contrast, visual inputs do not alter the running speed-dependent gain in neuronal firing rates. Moreover, we provide evidence that sensory inputs other than visual inputs can support grid cell firing, though less accurately, in complete darkness. Finally, changes in spatial accuracy of grid cell firing on a 10 s time scale suggest that grid cell firing is a function of velocity signals integrated over past time.",13
The unexplored territory of neural models: Potential guides for exploring the function of metabotropic neuromodulation,"Michael E Hasselmo, Andrew S Alexander, Alec Hoyland, Jennifer C Robinson, Marianne J Bezaire, G William Chapman, Ausra Saudargiene, Lucas C Carstensen, Holger Dannenberg",2021/2/21,Source Neuroscience,"The space of possible neural models is enormous and under-explored. Single cell computational neuroscience models account for a range of dynamical properties of membrane potential, but typically do not address network function. In contrast, most models focused on network function address the dimensions of excitatory weight matrices and firing thresholds without addressing the complexities of metabotropic receptor effects on intrinsic properties. There are many under-explored dimensions of neural parameter space, and the field needs a framework for representing what has been explored and what has not. Possible frameworks include maps of parameter spaces, or efforts to categorize the fundamental elements and molecules of neural circuit function. Here we review dimensions that are under-explored in network models that include the metabotropic modulation of synaptic plasticity and presynaptic …",6
The role of hierarchical dynamical functions in coding for episodic memory and cognition,"Holger Dannenberg, Andrew S Alexander, Jennifer C Robinson, Michael E Hasselmo",2019/8/1,Source Journal of cognitive neuroscience,"Behavioral research in human verbal memory function led to the initial definition of episodic memory and semantic memory. A complete model of the neural mechanisms of episodic memory must include the capacity to encode and mentally reconstruct everything that humans can recall from their experience. This article proposes new model features necessary to address the complexity of episodic memory encoding and recall in the context of broader cognition and the functional properties of neurons that could contribute to this broader scope of memory. Many episodic memory models represent individual snapshots of the world with a sequence of vectors, but a full model must represent complex functions encoding and retrieving the relations between multiple stimulus features across space and time on multiple hierarchical scales.

Temporal dynamics of cholinergic activity in the septo-hippocampal system,"Jeffrey D Kopsick, Kyle Hartzell, Hallie Lazaro, Pranav Nambiar, Michael E Hasselmo, Holger Dannenberg",2022,Journal bioRxiv,"Cholinergic projection neurons in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca are the major source of cholinergic modulation of hippocampal circuit functions that support neural coding of location and running speed. Changes in cholinergic modulation are known to correlate with changes in brain states, cognitive functions, and behavior. However, whether cholinergic modulation can change fast enough to serve as a potential speed signal in hippocampal and parahippocampal cortices and whether the temporal dynamics in such a signal depend on the presence of visual cues remain unknown. In this study, we use a fiber-photometric approach to quantify the temporal dynamics of cholinergic activity in freely moving mice as a function of the animal's running speed and visual cues. We show that the population activity of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca changes fast enough to be aligned well with changes in the animal's running speed and is strongly and linearly correlated to the logarithm of the animal's running speed. Intriguingly, the cholinergic modulation remains strongly and linearly correlated to the speed of the animal's neck movements during periods of stationary activity. Furthermore, we show that cholinergic modulation is unaltered during darkness. Lastly, we identify rearing, a discrete behavior where the mouse stands on its hindlimbs to scan the environment from an elevated perspective, is associated with higher cholinergic activity than expected from neck movements on the horizontal plane alone. Taken together, these data show that temporal dynamics in the cholinergic modulation of …",1
Direct and indirect cholinergic septo-hippocampal pathways cooperate to structure spiking activity in the hippocampus,Holger Dannenberg,2015/10/9,"Institution Bonn, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, Diss., 2015","The medial septum/vertical diagonal band of Broca complex (MSvDB) is a key structure that modulates hippocampal rhythmogenesis. Cholinergic neurons of the MSvDB play a central role in generating and pacing theta-band oscillations in the hippocampal formation during exploration, novelty detection, and memory encoding. However, how precisely cholinergic neurons affect hippocampal oscillatory activity and spiking rates of hippocampal neurons in vivo, has remained elusive. I therefore used silicon probe recordings of local field potentials and unit activity in the dorsal hippocampus in combination with cell type specific optogenetic activation of cholinergic MSvDB neurons to study the effects of synaptically released acetylcholine on hippocampal network activity in urethane-anesthetized mice. In vivo optogenetic activation of cholinergic MSvDB neurons induced hippocampal rhythmogenesis at the theta (3–6Hz) and slow gamma (26–48Hz) frequency range with a suppression of peri-theta frequencies. Interestingly, this effect was independent from the stimulation frequency. In addition, stimulation of cholinergic MSvDB neurons resulted in a net increase of interneuron firing with a concomitant net decrease of principal cell firing in the hippocampal CA3 subfield. I used focal injections of cholinergic blockers either into the MSvDB or the hippocampus to demonstrate that cholinergic MSvDB neurons modulate hippocampal network activity via two distinct pathways. Focal injection of a cholinergic blocker cocktail into the hippocampus strongly diminished the cholinergic stimulationinduced spiking rate modulation of hippocampal interneurons and …",1
