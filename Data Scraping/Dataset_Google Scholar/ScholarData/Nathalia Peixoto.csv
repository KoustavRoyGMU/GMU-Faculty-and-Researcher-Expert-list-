Lifetime assessment of atomic-layer-deposited Al2O3–Parylene C bilayer coating for neural interfaces using accelerated age testing and electrochemical characterization,"Saugandhika Minnikanti, Guoqing Diao, Joseph J Pancrazio, Xianzong Xie, Loren Rieth, Florian Solzbacher, Nathalia Peixoto",2014/2/1,Journal Acta biomaterialia,"The lifetime and stability of insulation are critical features for the reliable operation of an implantable neural interface device. A critical factor for an implanted insulation’s performance is its barrier properties that limit access of biological fluids to the underlying device or metal electrode. Parylene C is a material that has been used in FDA-approved implantable devices. Considered a biocompatible polymer with barrier properties, it has been used as a substrate, insulation or an encapsulation for neural implant technology. Recently, it has been suggested that a bilayer coating of Parylene C on top of atomic-layer-deposited Al2O3 would provide enhanced barrier properties. Here we report a comprehensive study to examine the mean time to failure of Parylene C and Al2O3–Parylene C coated devices using accelerated lifetime testing.

Real-time tracking of neuronal network structure using data assimilation,"Franz Hamilton, Tyrus Berry, Nathalia Peixoto, Timothy Sauer",2013/11/21,Journal Physical Review E,"A nonlinear data assimilation technique is applied to determine and track effective connections between ensembles of cultured spinal cord neurons measured with multielectrode arrays. The method is statistical, depending only on confidence intervals, and requiring no form of arbitrary thresholding. In addition, the method updates connection strengths sequentially, enabling real-time tracking of nonstationary networks. The ensemble Kalman filter is used with a generic spiking neuron model to estimate connection strengths as well as other system parameters to deal with model mismatch.

In vivo Characterization of Amorphous Silicon Carbide As a Biomaterial for Chronic Neural Interfaces,"Gretchen L Knaack, Daniel G McHail, German Borda, Beomseo Koo, Nathalia Peixoto, Stuart F Cogan, Theodore C Dumas, Joseph J Pancrazio",2016/6/28,Journal Frontiers in neuroscience,"Implantable microelectrode arrays (MEAs) offer clinical promise for prosthetic devices by enabling restoration of communication and control of artificial limbs. While proof-of-concept recordings from MEAs have been promising, work in animal models demonstrates that the obtained signals degrade over time. Both material robustness and tissue response are acknowledged to have a role in device lifetime. Amorphous Silicon carbide (a-SiC), a robust material that is corrosion resistant, has emerged as an alternative encapsulation layer for implantable devices. We systematically examined the impact of a-SiC coating on Si probes by immunohistochemical characterization of key markers implicated in tissue-device response. After implantation, we performed device capture immunohistochemical labeling of neurons, astrocytes, and activated microglia/macrophages after 4 and 8 weeks of implantation. Neuron loss and microglia activation were similar between Si and a-SiC coated probes, while tissue implanted with a-SiC displayed a reduction in astrocytes adjacent to the probe. These results suggest that a-SiC has a similar biocompatibility profile as Si, and may be suitable for implantable MEA applications as a hermetic coating to prevent material degradation.",42
Amyloid beta modulation of neuronal network activity in vitro,"Hamid Charkhkar, Susheela Meyyappan, Evgenia Matveeva, Jonathan R Moll, Daniel G McHail, Nathalia Peixoto, Richard O Cliff, Joseph J Pancrazio",2015/12/10,Journal Brain research,"In vitro assays offer a means of screening potential therapeutics and accelerating the drug development process. Here, we utilized neuronal cultures on planar microelectrode arrays (MEA) as a functional assay to assess the neurotoxicity of amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ42), a biomolecule implicated in the Alzheimer׳s disease (AD). In this approach, neurons harvested from embryonic mice were seeded on the substrate-integrated microelectrode arrays. The cultured neurons form a spontaneously active network, and the spiking activity as a functional endpoint could be detected via the MEA. Aβ42 oligomer, but not monomer, significantly reduced network spike rate. In addition, we demonstrated that the ionotropic glutamate receptors, NMDA and AMPA/kainate, play a role in the effects of Aβ42 on neuronal activity in vitro.

We tested a prototype system that allows for simultaneous PLEF stimulation with minimal recording artifact in a chronic tetanus toxin animal model (rat) of hippocampal epilepsy with spontaneous seizures. Depth electrode local field potentials recorded during seizures revealed a characteristic pattern of field postsynaptic potentials (fPSPs).

Voice controlled wheelchairs: Fine control by humming,"Nathalia Peixoto, Hossein Ghaffari Nik, Hamid Charkhkar",2013/10/1,Journal Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,"People without disabilities seamlessly control devices with their hands. Interestingly, their hands can perform coarse and fine control. Implementing smooth control for computerized systems is not straightforward and most of the time it is not intuitive either. Here we offer a solution to that problem: smooth control through humming. Voice commands have become ubiquitous in modern technology. Speech-to-text applications abound. Smooth control, on the other hand, has not been tackled yet. Here we design and implement a humming control technique, and demonstrate a hardware implementation with a powered wheelchair. Once actuated, the speed with which the chair moves will depend on the subtle variation on the fundamental frequency of the user's humming, acquired through an accelerometer measuring vocal cord vibration.

Correlation of the electrical and intrinsic optical signals in the chicken spreading depression phenomenon,"NLV Peixoto, VM Fernandes De Lima, W Hanke",2001/2/16,Journal Neuroscience letters,"This paper presents some results on the correlation between the electrophysiological and intrinsic optical signals (IOS) of spreading depression waves in chicken retinae. We first show that the peak of the time derivative of the electrophysiological wave occurs precisely when the optical signal reaches the electrode tip. Second, by comparing bath applications of propranolol and glycerol it can be shown that the slow potential shift is not directly correlated to the intrinsic optical signal. Propranolol depresses the amplitude of the electrical wave, although the intrinsic optical signal continues being visible. On the other hand, we observe total absence of the IOS under glycerol, while the electrical wave is always present. Correlations of this kind are relevant for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the spreading depression phenomenon.",32

Monitoring spontaneous activity of neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) provides an important tool for examining this neurotoxin. Changes in extracellular action potentials are readily observed and are dependent on synaptic function. Given the efficacy of murine frontal cortex and spinal cord networks to detect neuroactive substances, we investigated the effects of ω-agatoxin on spontaneous action potential firing within these networks.

The method uses a stack of several, nonidentical copies of a physical model to jointly reconstruct the variable in question.

Implantable electrodes with carbon nanotube coatings,"Saugandhika Minnikanti, Nathalia Peixoto",2011/8/1,Journal Carbon nanotubes applications on electron devices,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1950 (Monthioux & Kuznetsov, 2006; Radushkevich & Luk’yanovich 1952) and rediscovered in 1993 (Iijima & Ichihashi, 1993), came into the limelight as a promising next generation material for standard electronics, computers and aerospace industries. Its ballistic conductance, chemically inert nature (Niyogi et al., 2002), nano size (Ajayan 1999) and ease of chemical functionalization (Shim et al., 2002; Sinnott, 2002) opened the doors for it to become an important biomaterial (Malarkey & Parpura, 2007). The diameter of the nanotubes is of particular interest to neuroscientists: they are of the same order as neuronal processes. The interface of sub-cellular compartments with a material of that same size spawns numerous new ideas. This facilitates an interaction at a molecular level, imperative in the formation of"" functional neuronal circuits""(Lee & Parpura, 2009), was one of the possibilities considered early on.

Networks receiving this training signal displayed a time-dependent increase in the response to a low frequency probing stimulation, particularly in the time window of 20–50 ms after stimulation. This increase was found to be statistically significant as compared to control networks that did not receive training. The timing of this increase suggests potentiation of synaptic mechanisms.

The model accounts for the different resistivities and capacitances of the retina, pigment epithelium (PE), and sclera. Axiosymmetric 2-D FEMs were created for monopolar stimulation electrodes using COMSOL. 250 μm diameter electrodes with 10 μm thick insulation were placed at three different locations near the retina: the inner limiting membrane (epiretinal), the subretinal space (PE/retina)(subretinal), and the choroid layer behind the PE/retina (suprachoroidal). A broad return electrode was located at the back of the eye (sclera). The relative dielectric constants of each eyewall layer with linearly varying resistivity for the retina layers were incorporated into the model. Biphasic 1 mA/cm2 current pulses with pulse widths of either 0.5 ms (0.5 μC/cm2), 1ms (1 μC/cm2), and 5 ms (5 μC/cm2) were passed through the tip of the electrode for stimulation. We found that these waveforms, which match waveforms commonly used to activate the retina in retinal implants, show a transient-sustained electric field profile due to charging of the high capacitance and resistivity of the PE. The PE develops high electric fields in all three electrode models. Wider pulses induce greater electric fields in the PE than shorter pulses. This needs to be accounted for when determining safe levels of stimulation. Simulation models that assume constant resistivity (4k Ω-cm) for the retina calculate larger electric fields across the retina than Gaussian resistivity models (3k-7k Ω-cm).

For instance, a recent paper argued that several constructs serve as essential indicators of the quality of between-team activities including coordination, boundary spanning, and adaptation (Lazzara, Keebler, Shuffler, Patzer, Smith, & Misasi, 2015). This is a valuable theoretical insight, but the key to unlocking the full potential for real-world application in training and simulation is dependent on our ability to find proxies to measure those phenomena. Sensors that record proximity, position (GPS), and speech pattern data have been used as proxies for coordination, communication, and other team processes, including task management, situational awareness, and decision-making (Feese, Burscher, Jonas, & Tröster, 2014; Rosen, Dietz, Yang, Priebe, & Pronovost, 2014). Generally, data are gathered throughout an entire simulation, without a focus on which team inflection points and performance episodes are most important to capture. Moreover, emergency response scenarios are often handled by a complex system of teams varying in their betweenteam interdependencies.

HL-1 atrial myocytes were cultured onto the sensor surface. Cyclic voltammetry was utilized to characterize the sensor response over 30 minutes while the overlying tissue was subjected to either triiodothyronine or verapamil, drugs known to upregulate or downregulate, respectively, the metabolic activity of myocardial cells. Levels of percent of baseline current were calculated for both drugs, as well as for controls. The change of measured oxygen concentration was considered inversely proportional to the change in metabolic activity. Each of the drugs exerted a significant metabolic effect on the tissue, as evidenced by changes in the sensor current, thus confirming the ability to measure cellular metabolic changes at the tissue surface using the Clark-type oxygen sensor. Verapamil at 25µg/L was found to increase oxygen concentration to 135±4% as compared to control values (95±8%). Triiodothyronine at 2.5 µg/L, on the other hand, decreased oxygen levels in the extracellular space to 85±9%, as compared to baseline oxygen (98±6%).

Dynamic steering of in vitro cortical neurons using field stimulation,"Franz Hamilton, Alireza Akhavian, Gretchen Knaack, Hamid Charkhkar, Saugandhika Minnikanti, Woo-Ju Kim, Jemika Kastee, Nathalia Peixoto",2014/8/26,Conference 2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,"Neurological disorders are often characterized by abnormal neuronal activity. In the case of epilepsy, this can manifest itself in the form of uncontrolled synchronous activity often in the form of bursting. Pattern steering is the ability to apply stimulation to a network that effectively changes its dynamical firing pattern. In an epileptic network, the stimulation would be used to move the seizing network from its abnormal state to a normal state. This idea is explored here in cultured networks of cortical neurons plated on microelectrode arrays. Stimulation was applied to the bath resulting in an electric field generated throughout the network. This field was verified as sub-threshold in strength using a finite element model simulation. Stimulated networks showed a significant suppression in the number of bursts and increase in the interburst interval as compared to control networks. This observed burst suppression suggests that …",1

EEG Analysis to detect Attention,Caren Nesseem,2022,"Description The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that is known to be effective when studying. The technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980; it aims to accomplish the biggest amount of studying in the most efficient time. It is based on a 25-minute of focused studying, broken by a 5-minute break with no electronic use such as phones or TV during this 5-minute break. Following with a 15–20-minute break upon the competition of 4 work periods, with the approval of electronic use. Inspired by this, the subject of interest is identifying inattentiveness using EEG sensors either hardware or phone sensors. Then analyzing these signals to enhance our knowledge of attention and how long it takes until the subject is distracted, I can essentially use this research to amend our beliefs about attention span. This can also be used for teachers to know when the students need a break without trying to guess from their facial expressions and having solid research that proves an average student would need a break after a certain time. First, I will find a database of EEG recordings of individuals while trying to focus then I will perform a feature extraction process followed by data processing into MATLAB. Finally, I change my time domain data into the frequency domain and use bandpass filters to extract specific bands. This study aims for two goals, to better understand the attention span of everyone, leading to making the Pomodoro technique more customized for each person and to let the user know if they are getting sidetracked and give them the option to either resume focusing or to take a mental break. The expected results are that …","The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that is known to be effective when studying.

EEG-EMG-Based Interface For Upper Limb Exoskeleton–A Review,"Laura De Marzi, Nathalia Peixoto",2022,"Description The second most common cause of death in the world is cerebrovascular accident or stroke, and rehabilitation plays an important role to help the survivors of such accidents. Rehabilitation exercises are essential to speed up the process of recovery and regain independence, not only for post stroke cases but, also, for every patient who suffers of other neuromuscular diseases, such as spinal cord injuries or multiple sclerosis. The aging of the population, the increase of accident, and therefore, the increase of quality and quantity of rehabilitation needed, have led to the development of new techniques and assistance methods for recovery. Exoskeleton robotic devices have been developed to help the rehabilitation process, complementing the manual work of therapists. What is needed for an efficient and smooth implementation of this device is an advance interface between the wearable robot and the human. In this paper we have presented and analyzed two possible control input signals for exoskeletons, specifically electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG). We’ve delved deeper into these two techniques, studying their advantages and disadvantages. Advantages are for example their inherent intuitiveness and effectiveness. On the other hand there is high inter-subject variability of the EMG, and the non-invasiveness and high temporal resolution but relatively poor spatial resolution of the EEG technique. The purpose of this review is to study and contrast the two main techniques when used as brain machine interface for the control of exoskeletons.","The second most common cause of death in the world is cerebrovascular accident or stroke, and rehabilitation plays an important role to help the survivors of such accidents.

"The Study of Retinal Organoids: Development, Modeling, and Transplantation",Sally Farag,2022,"Description There are several different retinal diseases prominent within the United States including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. These three particular retinal diseases affect a total of 12.5 million people in the US alone, showing that retinal diseases are a very prevalent issue that require an improvement in the methodology of treatment. Retinal diseases can cause blindness and drastically decrease quality of life. To better treat these diseases and provide patients with proper care, it is important to maintain a proper understanding of the retina.  It has been found that retinal organoids (ROs) can be produced through the use of stem cells. When perfected, these ROs can provide advanced modeling of the retina, as well as modeling of novel treatments for retinal diseases and allow for better testing. Additionally, ROs can be modified in order to better depict retinal diseases and their microenvironments. They may also be used for retinal transplants as a method of treatment. However, ROs are still being developed and understood. Before the full use and benefits of ROs can be reaped, the differences between ROs and natural retinas must be understood and minimized. Additionally, various issues within the ROs themself must be tackled in order for their uses to become more advanced.","There are several different retinal diseases prominent within the United States including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma.

Investigation into the Link between Object Perception and Neural Activity in the Human Brain Using ECoG Data,Sabrina Stenberg,2022,"Description One area under investigation in the field of neuroscience is the link between object perception and neural activity in visual cortical areas of the human brain. By investigating the electrical potentials from the ventral temporal cortical surface in humans, the Stanford University study selected for this paper sought to collect sufficient information for spontaneous and near-instantaneous identification of a subject’s perceptual state. The brain signal data collection technique used by the researchers was electrocorticography (ECoG), using ECoG arrays placed on the subtemporal cortical surface of seven epilepsy patients. ECoG is an invasive electrogram method, requiring access to the surface of the brain, which can be applied to measure brain signals in response to specific stimuli. Using publicly available human ECoG recording data previously collected and made publicly available, this paper investigates visual object processing in the human brain. The data are taken from a study where seven epilepsy patients were shown house and face images in quick succession. We use those data and filter, process, and plot selected data to investigate the correct identification of the stimuli. We discovered that the incorrect stimuli matches are driven by variance in the human brain activity corresponding to the same set of stimuli. Better understanding of the visual processing capabilities of the human brain could lead to developments in machine learning, as well as generate recommendations for future data collection in human visual object processing.","One area under investigation in the field of neuroscience is the link between object perception and neural activity in visual cortical areas of the human brain.

Creating a Personalized Cognitive-Bias Modification Therapy Exercise in Virtual Reality Using Simulated Reaction Time Data,"NOAH EGAN, Nathalia Peixoto, Holly Matto",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Common addiction therapies often do not perform well enough to ensure long-term sobriety after treatment ends. This is thought to occur because treatments do not accurately simulate the real-life situations that lead an addict to relapse and fail to change the subconscious mechanisms behind addiction. Therapy exercises based in virtual reality (VR) could be programmed to use cues that are personalized to the patient and offer replay value to extend treatment indefinitely, solving the aforementioned problems. As a first step towards this goal, this research tested whether a player’s simulated response to a set of addiction-related cues could be used to create a personalized therapy exercise in VR. A therapy game utilizing the Approach-Avoidance Task was created, where the player minimized addiction-related cues to train avoidance bias and maximized positive cues to train approach bias.

A Wearable Biofeedback Intervention Device for Continuous Stress Monitoring with Pulse Transit Time Measurement,"CHRISTIAN YUPANQUI, Nathalia Peixoto",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Stress can lead to increased vulnerability to disease and is important for management of recovery for substance use disorder. Stress can determined by pulse transit time (PTT) within a physiological monitoring system, using both electrocardiogram and pulse waves. Pulse transit time is the time difference between the R peak in the ECG wave and the start of the pulse. Recovering patients exhibit stress when facing cues, so a biofeedback system would recognize this stress and train the user with a relaxation method. The system is intended to be portable with three electrodes located near the center of the chest. An Arduino was connected to a custom ECG and a pulse sensor worn on the wrist that used photoplethysmography. The pulse sensor had noise when there was wrist movement. Chest movement and heavy breathing shifted the baseline of the QRS complex. Both had small fluctuations which were reduced …",
A Novel Multimodal Physiological Monitoring System for Virtual Reality-Based Addiction Therapy,"BENJAMIN J CHOI, Nathalia Peixoto",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"As conventional substance use disorder (SUD) treatments often fail to prevent patient relapse upon reexposure to SUD-related stimuli, virtual reality (VR) has recently emerged as a popular hypothetical medium for an enhanced form of SUD cue exposure therapy (CET).

"Functionals Aspects and Simultaneous Detection of Dopamine, Ascorbic Acid and Uric Acid Using Chitosan-Catechol Graphene and Carbon Nanotube Modified Electrodes","Tjerignimin Adissa Silue, Valerie Lewitus, Abul Hussam, Hadar Ben-Yoav, Nathalia Peixoto",2019,Journal Journal of Biomedical Engineering,"Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain. The dysfunction of the dopaminergic system is the leading cause of numerous diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. Hence, it is important to find selective and sensitive detection methods for the early diagnosis of diseases related to the abnormal levels of dopamine. In this study, we show a new electrochemical sensing platform based on carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and a sheet of graphene (GRA). The novelty of our sensor is the coating of the substrates with chitosan-catechol (CC) by electrodeposition, enhancing the dopamine response by 70%. The dose-response for each set of electrodes (bare CNT, bare GRA, and coated CNT as well as coated GRA) was measured. Finally, the electrodes were tested in cerebrospinal fluid (artificial and human), for the detection of millimolar to nanomolar levels of dopamine. The electrodes exhibited high sensitivity (2.03 mA mol· L-1, 1.45 mA mol· L-1, 0.0298 mA mol· L-1, and 0.0559 mA mol· L-1 for the modified CNT, bare CNT, modified GRA and bare GRA, respectively, for the oxidation of DA. The oxidation peak current was proportional to the concentration of DA in the range from 50× 10-6 to 50x10-9 M (n= 6, r2= 0.98). The dopamine recovery in human CSF were, 49-78% and 65-65% with coated graphene and CNT electrodes, respectively. Our results indicate that the CC modified CNT electrodes achieved the best recovery, sensitivity, limit of detection, and selectivity compared to the uncoated CNT as well as the coated and uncoated graphene electrodes.",

Low Impedance Electrodes for Biological Applications Using Carbon Nanotubes,"Saugandhika Minnikanti, Nathalia Peixoto",2007/3/1,Journal ECS Meeting Abstracts,"Ballistic conductance and large surface area make carbon nanotubes excellent candidates for interfacing electrodes with biological tissue. Common requirements for electrodes in biological applications are high charge capacity, low impedance, small surface area, biocompatibility, and chemical and mechanical stability. Small surface area implies high impedance, which usually hinders performance in terms of signal transfer in stimulation paradigms. Carbon nanotubes, if deposited on a substrate with high impedance, can give rise to high charge carrying capacity and lower the impedance over three decades in frequency without significant increases to the geometrical area.",

Raman analysis shows a multilayer structure on the walls, suggesting different refractive indices for each layer.
