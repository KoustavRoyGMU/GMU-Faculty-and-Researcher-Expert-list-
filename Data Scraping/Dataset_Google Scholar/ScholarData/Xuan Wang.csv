A distributed algorithm for least squares solutions,"Xuan Wang, Jingqiu Zhou, Shaoshuai Mou, Martin J Corless",2019/1/22,Journal IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"In this technical note, a distributed algorithm is proposed for multiagent networks to achieve a least squares solution of a system of linear equations, in which each agent only knows part of the overall equations and communicates only with its nearby neighbors. The proposed algorithm is discrete time but does not involve small or time-varying step sizes. Given that the network is fixed, connected, and undirected, the proposed algorithm enables all agents in the network to achieve exponentially fast the same least squares solution; this is validated by simulations.",55
Improvement of a distributed algorithm for solving linear equations,"Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou, Dengfeng Sun",2016/12/6,Journal IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,"This paper performs further improvement to a distributed algorithm for solving linear algebraic equations via multi-agent networks recently developed by Mou et al., in which all agents' states converge exponentially fast to the same solution to a group of linear equations by assuming each agent knows only part of the linear equations and its nearby neighbors' states. We first prove that the algorithm proposed by Mou et al. with special initialization is able to achieve the solution that is closest to a given point in the Euclidean distance. Second, we eliminate the required initialization step used by Mou et al. by a modification to the update equation. Both analytical and numerical results are provided for validation.",54
"Scalable, distributed algorithms for solving linear equations via double-layered networks","Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou, Brian DO Anderson",2019/5/27,Journal IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"This paper proposes scalable, distributed algorithms for solving linear equations by integrating two mechanisms, termed consensus and conservation, in double-layered multiagent networks. The multiagent network considered in this paper is composed of clusters and each cluster consists of an aggregator and a subnetwork of agents. By achieving consensus and conservation through agent-agent communications in the same cluster and aggregator-aggregator communications among different clusters, respectively, distributed algorithms are devised for agents to cooperatively achieve a solution to the overall linear equation. These algorithms outperform existing algorithms, including but not limited to the following aspects-first, each agent does not have to know as much as a complete row or column of the overall equation; second, each agent only needs to control as few as two scalar states when the number of …",24
A resilient convex combination for consensus-based distributed algorithms,"Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou, Shreyas Sundaram",2018/6/27,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.10271,"Consider a set of vectors in , partitioned into two classes: normal vectors and malicious vectors. The number of malicious vectors is bounded but their identities are unknown. The paper provides a way for achieving a resilient convex combination, which is a convex combination of only normal vectors. Compared with existing approaches based on Tverberg points, the proposed method based on the intersection of convex hulls has lower computational complexity. Simulations suggest that the proposed method can be applied to resilience for consensus-based distributed algorithms against Byzantine attacks.",19
Finite-Time Distributed Linear Equation Solver for Solutions With Minimum -Norm,"Jingqiu Zhou, Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou, Brian DO Anderson",2019/7/30,Journal IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"This paper proposes a continuous-time distributed algorithm for multiagent networks to achieve a solution with the minimum l 1 -norm to underdetermined linear equations. The proposed algorithm comes from a combination of the Filippov set-valued map with the projection-consensus flow.

A distributed linear equation solver for least square solutions,"Xuan Wang, Jingqiu Zhou, Shaoshuai Mou, Martin J Corless",2017/12/12,Conference 2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"This paper proposes a distributed update for achieving the least square solution of linear equations by multiagent networks, in which each agent only knows part of these linear equations and is able to communicate with its nearby neighbors. It has been analytically proved that for undirected and connected network, the proposed update enables all agents to achieve an exact least square solution exponentially fast by iteratively updating its own state based on those from its neighbors. Moreover, the exponential convergence does not rely on any time-varying small step size.",13
Online Deflection Estimation of X-Axis Beam on Positioning Machine,"Xuan Wang, Huijun Gao, Okyay Kaynak, Weichao Sun",2015/7/14,Journal IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,"For high-precision devices, one of the most important factors that influence their positioning accuracy is the deflection in the mechanical structures. The finite-element method (FEM) is the most common method used to investigate deflections. However, it has such a high computational complexity that it cannot be used in real-time deflection correction applications. In this paper, to improve the accuracy of a positioning machine, an online deflection estimation method that has high accuracy and low computational complexity is proposed. First, by analyzing the mechanical characteristics of the beam, the effect of the positioning head on the beam is represented by four forces located at their contact points and a deflection estimation model is developed. Then, the uncertain parameters of this estimation model are identified by the use of the deflection values obtained from the FEM analysis. The final mathematical model is …",13
A distributed algorithm for achieving the conservation principle,"Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou",2018/6/27,Conference 2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC),"A distributed and continuous update is proposed for multi-agent networks to achieve the conservation principle, in which each agent can only communicate with its nearby neighbors. The information known to each agent is part of the overall conservation constraint, which is determined by states of its neighbors. Different from achieving consensus, agents in the networks control states that might not necessarily be in the same dimension. Given the underlying network to be undirected and connected, the proposed update drives all agents' states to converge asymptotically to constants satisfying the nonlinear conservation principle, under mild assumptions. The assumption is relaxed when the conservation principle is linear, for which the convergence is exponentially fast. Both analytical results and numerical simulations are provided, followed by applications in achieving least square solutions in a distributed way.",9

Further discussions on a distributed algorithm for solving linear algebra equations,"Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou, Dengfeng Sun",2017/5/24,Conference 2017 American Control Conference (ACC),"In [2], a distributed algorithm has recently been developed for solving linear algebraic equations via multi-agent networks. To adopt the algorithm, each agent only has to know part of the linear equation as well as its nearby neighbors' estimates to the solution. In this paper, we would like to further discuss this algorithm from the following two perspectives. The first one is to improve the numerical stability of the algorithm and meanwhile eliminate initialization step that is necessary in [2]. The second one is to achieve a specific solution with minimum l 2  norm when the linear equation has more than one solutions.",7
A distributed algorithm with scalar states for solving linear equations,"Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou, Brian DO Anderson",2018/12/17,Conference 2018 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"Based on a combination of consensus and conservation, the paper develops a distributed update for solving linear equations by multi-agent networks, in which each agent only knows just a small part of the overall equation and can only communicate with its nearby neighbors. In the proposed distributed update, each agent knows only two scalar entries of the defining matrix of the overall equation and controls just two scalar states.

Analytical proof is provided for the exponential convergence of the proposed update, which is also validated by numerical simulations.",5
Consensus-based Distributed Optimization Enhanced by Integral-Feedback,"Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou, Brian DO Anderson",2022/4/21,Journal IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"Inspired and underpinned by the idea of integral feedback, a distributed constant gain algorithm is proposed for multi-agent networks to solve convex optimization problems with local linear constraints. Assuming agent interactions are modeled by an undirected graph, the algorithm is capable of achieving the optimum solution with an exponential convergence rate. Furthermore, inherited from the beneficial integral feedback, the proposed algorithm has attractive requirements on communication bandwidth and good robustness against disturbance.

Resilience for Distributed Consensus with Constraints,"Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou, Shreyas Sundaram",2022/6/12,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.05662,"This paper proposes a new approach that enables multi-agent systems to achieve resilient constrained consensus in the presence of Byzantine attacks, in contrast to existing literature that is only applicable for unconstrained resilient consensus problems. The key enabler for our approach is a new device called a -resilient convex combination, which allows normal agents in the network to utilize their locally available information to automatically isolate the impact of the Byzantine agents. Such a resilient convex combination is computable through linear programming, whose complexity scales well with the size of the overall system. By employing this new device to multi-agent systems, we introduce redundancy conditions under which resilient constrained consensus can be achieved with an exponential convergence rate. We also provide insights on the design of a network such that the redundancy conditions are satisfied. We validate all the proposed results through theoretical proofs. Finally, numerical simulations and an application example of safe multi-agent learning are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.",1
Data-driven reconstruction of firing rate dynamics in brain networks,"Xuan Wang, Jorge Cortés",2021/12/14,Conference 2021 60th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"This paper studies the reconstruction from data of firing rate dynamics in linear-threshold network models of brain activity. Instead of identifying the system paramaters directly, which would lead to a large number of variables and a highly non-convex objective function, the novelty of our approach stems from reformulating the identification problem as a scalar variable optimization of a discontinuous, nonconvex objective function. We formally show that the reformulated optimization problem has a unique solution and establish that it leads to the identification of all the desired system parameters. These results form the basis for the introduction of an algorithm to find the optimizer that identifies the different regions in the domain of definition of the objective function. The results not only validate the system identifiability but also provide the foundation for further research on data-driven control of firing rate dynamics. We …",1
Distributed Algorithm with Resilience for Multi-Agent Task Allocation,"Xuan Wang, Jeffrey Hudack, Shaoshuai Mou",2021/5/10,Conference 2021 4th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS),"This paper develops an Iterated Auction-Consensus Algorithm (IACA) for resilient task allocation on a distributed multi-agent platform. The IACA enables each agent in the network to bid for tasks of interest at the auction stage and then utilizes the idea of consensus to resolve conflicts among agents' bids. Such a combination of auction and consensus enables each agent to repeatedly add tasks one by one to its task bundle until reaching its maximum bundle length. The major advantages of the IACA are twofold. One is the simplicity of implementation without requiring complicate decision logic. The other one is resilience, when there are malicious agents trying to block the normal agents' bids by giving infinitely large bids to all tasks, IACA is able to recover immediately after the removal of malicious agents. We investigate and compare costs for communications and computations by providing quantitative measures …",1
A Discrete-time Distributed Algorithm for Minimum l1-Norm Solution of an Under-determined Linear Equation Set,"Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou, Brian DO Anderson",2020/1/1,Journal IFAC-PapersOnLine,"This paper proposes a discrete-time, distributed algorithm for multi-agent networks to achieve the minimum l1-norm solution to a group of linear equations known to possess a family of solutions. We assume each agent in the network knows only one equation and can communicate with only its neighbors. The algorithm is developed based on a combination of the projection-consensus idea and the sub-gradient descent method. Given the underlying network graph to be directed and strongly connected, we prove that the algorithm enables all agents to achieve a common minimum l1-norm solution. The major difficulty to be dealt with is the non-smooth nature of the norm and the lack of strict convexity of the associated relevant performance index.",1
A scalable distributed algorithm for least squares solutions in double-layered multi-agent networks,"Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou",2019/7/10,Conference 2019 American Control Conference (ACC),"In this paper, we propose a scalable distributed algorithm for double-layered multi-agent network to cooperatively find the least square solutions to an over-determined linear equation. Compared with existing consensus-based distributed linear equation solvers, the double-layered network structure allows us to implement two types of coordination, namely consensus and conservation, simultaneously. As a result, the proposed algorithm has achieved better scalability in the sense that each agent does not need to know a full row of the overall equation. The convergence of our algorithm is exponential, which has been validated by both analytical proof and numerical simulations.",1
Learning multi-robot coordination from demonstrations,"Xuan Wang, Wanxin Jin",2022/7/18,Journal arXiv,"This paper develops a Distributed Differentiable Dynamic Game (DDDG) framework, which enables learning multi-robot coordination from demonstrations. We represent multi-robot coordination as a dynamic game, where the behavior of a robot is dictated by its own dynamics and objective that also depends on others' behavior. The coordination thus can be adapted by tuning the objective and dynamics of each robot. The proposed DDDG enables each robot to automatically tune its individual dynamics and objectives in a distributed manner by minimizing the mismatch between its trajectory and demonstrations. This process requires a new distributed design of the forward-pass, where all robots collaboratively seek Nash equilibrium behavior, and a backward-pass, where gradients are propagated via the communication graph. We test the DDDG in simulation with a team of quadrotors given different task configurations. The results demonstrate the capability of DDDG for learning multi-robot coordination from demonstrations",
Data-Driven Control of Linear-Threshold Network Dynamics,"Xuan Wang, Jorge Cortés",2022/6/8,Conference 2022 American Control Conference (ACC),"This paper studies the data-driven stabilization of linear-threshold network models. Our goal is to design a linear state feedback controller to stabilize the system to the origin purely based on data samples, instead of a parametric model. To achieve this, we first establish a data-based representation for the linear-threshold network in an open-loop form. This is done by introducing a map that represents the state-input pair as a transformation of data matrices. We then employ a linear feedback controller in the formulation of the map and obtain a closed-loop data-based representation for the system. To facilitate the design of the feedback gain matrix, we rewrite the dynamics as a switched linear system relying on the special structure of linear thresholding. The design problem then becomes equivalent to solving a system of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). We analyze the associated computational complexity and, to …",
More Consensus is not always Beneficial,"Xuan Wang, Shaoshuai Mou",2020/7/1,Conference 2020 American Control Conference (ACC),"This paper shows that more consensus is not always beneficial to the convergence rate of consensus-based distributed computational algorithms. Specifically, we focus on the consensus-based distributed algorithm for solving linear equations, which aims to enable multiple agents in a network to cooperatively find a solution to large-scale linear equations. Such algorithms have two key components: local computation that happens within each agent; and global consensus that happens among connected agents through the networks. Intuitively, one expects more consensus in each iteration should speed up the convergence of such algorithms. However, according to the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations provided in this paper, such assumption does not hold. Counter-intuitively, we show that more consensus is not always beneficial to consensus-based distributed algorithms, and sometimes slow down …",
DISTRIBUTED CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION IN MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS,Xuan Wang,2020/6/16,Institution Purdue University Graduate School,"In recent years, the collective behaviors in nature have motivated rapidly expanding research efforts in the control of multi-agent systems. A multi-agent system is composed of multiple interacting subsystems (agents). In order to seek approaches that respect the network nature of multi-agent systems, distributed algorithms has recently received a significant amount of research attention, the goal of which is allowing multi-agent systems to accomplish global objectives through only local coordination.    Under this scope,  we consider three major problems in this dissertation, namely, distributed computation, distributed optimization, and the resilience of distributed algorithms. First, for distributed computation, we devise distributed algorithms for solving linear equations, which can eliminate the initialization step for agents; converge to the minimum  and  solutions of under-determined linear equations; achieve …",
