Spline estimation of single-index models,"Li Wang, Lijian Yang",2009/4/1,Journal Statistica Sinica,"For the past two decades, the single-index model, a special case of projection pursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high-dimensional problem in nonparametric regression.

Regional soil erosion assessment based on a sample survey and geostatistics,"Shuiqing Yin, Zhengyuan Zhu, Li Wang, Baoyuan Liu, Yun Xie, Guannan Wang, Yishan Li",2018/3/8,Journal Hydrology and Earth System Sciences," Soil erosion is one of the most significant environmental problems in China. From 2010 to 2012, the fourth national census for soil erosion sampled 32 364 PSUs (Primary Sampling Units, small watersheds) with the areas of 0.2–3 km2. Land use and soil erosion controlling factors including rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length, slope steepness, biological practice, engineering practice, and tillage practice for the PSUs were surveyed, and the soil loss rate for each land use in the PSUs was estimated using an empirical model, the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE). Though the information collected from the sample units can be aggregated to estimate soil erosion conditions on a large scale; the problem of estimating soil erosion condition on a regional scale has not been addressed well. The aim of this study is to introduce a new model-based regional soil erosion assessment method combining a sample survey and geostatistics. We compared seven spatial interpolation models based on the bivariate penalized spline over triangulation (BPST) method to generate a regional soil erosion assessment from the PSUs.

Spatially varying coefficient models with sign preservation of the coefficient functions,"Myungjin Kim, Li Wang, Yuyu Zhou",2021/9,"Journal Journal of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental Statistics","This paper considers the estimation and inference of spatially varying coefficient models, while preserving the sign of the coefficient functions. In practice, there are various situations where coefficient functions are assumed to be in a certain subspace. For example, they should be either nonnegative or nonpositive on a domain by their nature. However, optimization on a global space of coefficient functions does not ensure that estimates preserve meaningful features in their signs. In this paper, we propose sign-preserved and efficient estimators of the coefficient functions using novel bivariate spline estimators under their smoothness conditions. Our algorithm, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, yields estimated coefficient functions that are nonnegative or nonpositive, consistent, and efficient. Simulation studies are conducted to address the advantages of the sign preservation method for …",7
"Methods, challenges, and practical issues of COVID-19 projection: A data science perspective","Myungjin Kim, Zhiling Gu, Shan Yu, Guannan Wang, Li Wang",2021/4,Journal Journal of Data Science,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has placed epidemic modeling at the center of attention of public policymaking. Predicting the severity and speed of transmission of COVID-19 is crucial to resource management and developing strategies to deal with this epidemic. Based on the available data from current and previous outbreaks, many efforts have been made to develop epidemiological models, including statistical models, computer simulations, mathematical representations of the virus and its impacts, and many more. Despite their usefulness, modeling and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 remains a challenge. In this article, we give an overview of the unique features and issues of COVID-19 data and how they impact epidemic modeling and projection. In addition, we illustrate how various models could be connected to each other. Moreover, we provide new data science perspectives on the challenges of COVID-19 forecasting, from data collection, curation, and validation to the limitations of models, as well as the uncertainty of the forecast. Finally, we discuss some data science practices that are crucial to more robust and accurate epidemic forecasting.",6
Sparse model identification and learning for ultra-high-dimensional additive partially linear models,"Xinyi Li, Li Wang, Dan Nettleton",2019/9/1,Journal Journal of Multivariate Analysis,"The additive partially linear model (APLM) combines the flexibility of nonparametric regression with the parsimony of regression models, and has been widely used as a popular tool in multivariate nonparametric regression to alleviate the “curse of dimensionality”. A natural question raised in practice is the choice of structure in the nonparametric part, i.e., whether the continuous covariates enter into the model in linear or nonparametric form. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for simultaneous sparse model identification and learning for ultra-high-dimensional APLMs where both the linear and nonparametric components are possibly larger than the sample size. We propose a fast and efficient two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we decompose the nonparametric functions into a linear part and a nonlinear part. The nonlinear functions are approximated by constant spline bases, and a triple …",5
Semi-parametric prediction intervals in small areas when auxiliary data are measured with error,"Gauri Datta, Aurore Delaigle, Peter Hall, Li Wang",2018/1/1,Journal Statistica Sinica,"In recent years, demand for reliable small area statistics has considerably increased, but the size of samples obtained in small areas is too often small to produce accurate predictors of quantities of interest. To overcome this difficulty, a common approach is to use auxiliary data from other areas or other sources, and produce estimators that combine them with direct data. A popular model for combining direct and indirect data sources is the Fay-Herriot model, which assumes that the auxiliary variables are observed accurately. However, these variables are often subject to measurement errors, and not taking this into account can lead to estimators that are even worse than those based exclusively on the direct data. We consider structural measurement error models and a semi-parametric approach based on the Fay-Herriot model to produce reliable prediction intervals for small area characteristics of interest.

Efficacy of information in mineral exploration drilling,"J Caers, C Scheidt, Z Yin, L Wang, T Mukerji, K House",2022/6,Journal Natural Resources Research,"In mineral exploration, targets need to be confirmed by means of drilling. Such drilling is based on anomalies often detected in geochemical and/or geophysical exploration. Because drilling is costly and because mineral exploration has low success rate, the need to know quickly, with minimal drilling, whether a target is mineable or not, is an important problem. Value of information (VOI) is a decision-theoretic concept that quantifies by how much information reduces risk about a project dollar-value; hence, optimizing its value provides a means for optimizing the location of drilling. However, VOI depends on actual dollar values of success vs. failure, which may be uncertain themselves, or not yet relevant. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, termed efficacy of information (EOI), which is like VOI but without monetary rewards or costs. It quantifies by how much, on average, future information reduces uncertainty …",4

Security price responses to unexpected earnings: a nonparametric investigation,"Lei Gao, Li Wang",2011/6,Journal Statistical Methods & Applications,"The widely used linear model of the unexpected earnings/returns relationship has been challenged. In this article we propose a flexible nonparametric approach to study this relationship in which splines are used to approximate the unknown regression function. Spline confidence bands are constructed based on wild bootstrap to examine the adequacy of certain linear/nonlinear specifications. Monte Carlo results show that the proposed bands have excellent coverage of the true regression function with little computing load. These properties make the procedure highly recommended for extracting information from large and complicated datasets. The proposed approach has also been applied to the real world financial data from the unexpected earnings/returns study, and we find significant evidence of nonlinearity. The nonlinearity persists when we control the measurement errors of the earning surprises …",4

Spatial autoregressive partially linear varying coefficient models,"Jingru Mu, Guannan Wang, Li Wang",2020/4/2,Journal Journal of Nonparametric Statistics,"In this article, we consider a class of partially linear spatially varying coefficient autoregressive models for data distributed over complex domains. We propose approximating the varying coefficient functions via bivariate splines over triangulation to deal with the complex boundary of the spatial domain. Under some regularity conditions, the estimated constant coefficients are asymptotically normally distributed, and the estimated varying coefficients are consistent and possess the optimal convergence rate. A penalized bivariate spline estimation method with a more flexible choice of triangulation is proposed. We further develop a fast algorithm to calculate the geodesic distance. The proposed method is much more computationally efficient than the local smoothing methods, and thus capable of handling large scales of spatial data. In addition, we propose a model selection approach to identify predictors with constant …",3
Estimation and inference for functional linear regression models with partially varying regression coefficients,"Guanqun Cao, Shuoyang Wang, Lily Wang",2020,Journal Stat,"In this paper, we present a class of functional linear regression models with varying coefficients of a functional response on one or multiple functional predictors and scalar predictors. In particular, the approach can accommodate densely or sparsely sampled functional responses as well as multiple scalar and functional predictors. It also allows for the combination of continuous or categorical covariates. Tensor product B‐spline basis is proposed for the estimation of the bivariate coefficient functions. We show that our estimators hold asymptotic consistency and normality. Several numerical examples demonstrate superior performance of the proposed methods against two existing approaches. The proposed method is also applied to a real data example.",3
Additive partially linear models for ultra‐high‐dimensional regression,"Xinyi Li, Li Wang, Dan Nettleton",2019,Journal Stat,"We consider a semiparametric additive partially linear regression model (APLM) for analysing ultra‐high‐dimensional data where both the number of linear components and the number of non‐linear components can be much larger than the sample size. We propose a two‐step approach for estimation, selection, and simultaneous inference of the components in the APLM. In the first step, the non‐linear additive components are approximated using polynomial spline basis functions, and a doubly penalized procedure is proposed to select nonzero linear and non‐linear components based on adaptive lasso. In the second step, local linear smoothing is then applied to the data with the selected variables to obtain the asymptotic distribution of the estimators of the nonparametric functions of interest. The proposed method selects the correct model with probability approaching one under regularity conditions. The …",3
Simultaneous inference for the mean of repeated functional data,"Guanqun Cao, Li Wang",2018/5/1,Journal Journal of Multivariate Analysis,"Motivated by recent works studying the longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies, we develop a novel procedure to construct simultaneous confidence bands for mean functions of repeatedly observed functional data. A fully nonparametric method is proposed to estimate the mean function and variance–covariance function of the repeated trajectories via polynomial spline smoothing. The proposed confidence bands are shown to be asymptotically correct by taking into account the correlation of trajectories within subjects. The procedure is also extended to the two-sample case in which we focus on comparing the mean functions from two populations of functional data. We show the finite-sample properties of the proposed confidence bands by simulation studies, and compare the performance of our approach with the “naive” method that assumes the independence within the repeatedly observed trajectories …",3

Estimating 1 km gridded daily air temperature using a spatially varying coefficient model with sign preservation,"Tao Zhang, Yuyu Zhou, Li Wang, Kaiguang Zhao, Zhengyuan Zhu",2022/8/1,Journal Remote Sensing of Environment,"Near-surface air temperature (Ta) is one of the key variables in a variety of studies such as hydrological modeling, assessment of heat waves, and energy modeling. Among existing methods, statistical algorithms are suitable for integrating auxiliary spatial data with station-based Ta data to produce gridded Ta over large areas. However, existing statistical algorithms (e.g., Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)) cannot always correctly capture and preserve relationships between Ta and explanatory variables, which may increase uncertainties of relevant applications based on the estimated Ta with abnormal spatial patterns. This issue is mainly caused by the lack of enough observations due to the limited spatial coverage of weather stations, leading to abnormal relationships between Ta and explanatory variables. In order to address this issue, in this study, we introduced a new method named the Spatially …",1

This global pandemic has not only presented an unprecedented challenge to public health but also has led to a dramatic loss of human life and severe economic consequences worldwide. Many people have been pushed into poverty due to coronavirus pandemic. By middle April, over 20 million Americans filed for unemployment since President Donald J. Trump declared a state of emergency on March 13. Based on the Washington Post, a study by researchers at the University of Illinois, Harvard Business School, Harvard University, and the University of Chicago estimated that over 100 thousand small businesses would be permanently closed, and 5.4 million Americans could lose their health insurance between early March and early May. Therefore, evaluating a reasonable date for resumption of business is essential for combating the COVID-19 and stimulating economic development.

A global gridded dataset of daily maximum and minimum Ta (Tmax and Tmin) is particularly valuable and critically needed in the scientific and policy communities, but is still not available. In this paper, we developed a global dataset of daily Tmax and Tmin dataset at 1-km resolution from 2003 to 15 2020 through the combined use of station-based ground Ta measurements and satellite observations (ie, digital elevation model, and land surface temperature) via a state-of-the-art statistical method named Spatially Varying Coefficient Models with Sign Preservation (SVCM-SP). The root mean square errors of our estimates ranged from 1.20 to 2.44 for Tmax and 1.69 to 2.39 ºC for Tmin. We found that the accuracies were affected primarily by land cover types, elevation ranges, and climate backgrounds. Our dataset correctly represents the negative and positive relationships between Ta with elevation or land surface temperature; it 20 captured spatial and temporal patterns of Ta realistically. This global 1-km gridded daily Tmax and Tmin dataset is the first of its kind and we expect it to be of great value to global studies such as urban heat island phenomenon, hydrological modeling, and epidemic forecasting.
