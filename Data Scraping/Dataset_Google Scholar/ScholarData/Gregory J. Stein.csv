The formation of stable and robust filaments with several microjoules of pulse energy is observed. We demonstrate a supercontinuum that spans more than three octaves from ZnS in the normal GVD regime and self-compression of the mid-IR pulse to sub-two-cycle duration in CaF_2 in the anomalous GVD regime. The experimental observations quantitatively agree well with the numerical simulations based on a three-dimensional nonlinear wave equation that reveals the detailed spatio-temporal dynamics of mid-IR filaments in dielectrics.,115

Optimization of the gas pressure and waveguide configuration has enabled us to produce bright and spatially coherent harmonics extending from the extreme ultraviolet to soft x rays. Our study on the interplay among waveguide mode, atomic dispersion, and plasma effect uncovers how dynamic phase matching is accomplished and how an optimized waveform is maintained when optimal waveguide parameters (radius and length) and gas pressure are identified.

GeneSIS-RT: Generating synthetic images for training secondary real-world tasks,"Gregory J Stein, Nicholas Roy",2018/5/21,Conference 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),"We propose a novel approach for generating high-quality, synthetic data for domain-specific learning tasks, for which training data may not be readily available.

Learning unknown groundings for natural language interaction with mobile robots,"Mycal Tucker, Derya Aksaray, Rohan Paul, Gregory J Stein, Nicholas Roy",2020,Conference Robotics Research: The 18th International Symposium ISRR,"Our goal is to enable robots to understand or “ground” natural language instructions in the context of their perceived workspace. Contemporary models learn a probabilistic correspondence between input phrases and semantic concepts (or groundings) such as objects, regions or goals for robot motion derived from the robot’s world model. Crucially, these models assume a fixed and a priori known set of object types as well as phrases and train probable correspondences offline using static language-workspace corpora. Hence, model inference fails when an input command contains unknown phrases or references to novel object types that were not seen during the training. We introduce a probabilistic model that incorporates a notion of unknown groundings and learns a correspondence between an unknown phrase and an unknown object that cannot be classified into known visual categories.

Enabling topological planning with monocular vision,"Gregory J Stein, Christopher Bradley, Victoria Preston, Nicholas Roy",2020/5/31,Conference 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),"Topological strategies for navigation meaningfully reduce the space of possible actions available to a robot, allowing use of heuristic priors or learning to enable computationally efficient, intelligent planning. The challenges in estimating structure with monocular SLAM in low texture or highly cluttered environments have precluded its use for topological planning in the past. We propose a robust sparse map representation that can be built with monocular vision and overcomes these shortcomings. Using a learned sensor, we estimate high-level structure of an environment from streaming images by detecting sparse ""vertices"" (e.g., boundaries of walls) and reasoning about the structure between them. We also estimate the known free space in our map, a necessary feature for planning through previously unknown environments.

Generating high-quality explanations for navigation in partially-revealed environments,Gregory Stein,2021/12/6,Journal Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,"We present an approach for generating natural language explanations of high-level behavior of autonomous agents navigating in partially-revealed environments. Our counterfactual explanations communicate changes to interpratable statistics of the belief (eg, the likelihood an exploratory action will reach the unseen goal) that are estimated from visual input via a deep neural network and used (via a Bellman equation variant) to inform planning far into the future. Additionally, our novel training procedure mimics explanation generation, allowing us to use planning performance as an objective measure of explanation quality. Simulated experiments validate that our explanations are both high quality and can be used in interventions to directly correct bad behavior; agents trained via our training-by-explaining procedure achieve 9.1% lower average cost than a non-learned baseline (12.7% after interventions) in environments derived from real-world floor plans.",4

However, the limited gain bandwidth of laser crystals such as Ho: YLF and Ho: YAG allows the generation of picosecond (ps) long pulses and, hence, makes it challenging to generate few-cycle pulse at 2 μm without utilizing an optical parametric chirped-pulse amplifier (OPCPA). Moreover, the exclusive use of the near-infrared wavelength has limited the generation of wavelengths beyond 4 μm (OPCPA). Furthermore, high harmonic generation (HHG) conversion efficiency reduces dramatically when driven by a long-wavelength laser.

Representations for intelligent navigation in unfamiliar environments,Gregory Joseph Stein,2020,Institution Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"The way an agent chooses to represent the world around it is fundamental to its ability to effectively interact with it. The work presented in this thesis is centered around the development of new representations that enable embodied agents to better understand the impact of their actions, so that they may plan quickly and intelligently in a dynamic and uncertain world. In this thesis, we focus on the problem of autonomous navigation in complex, unknown environments. Consider an embodied agent tasked with traveling to an unseen goal in minimum time. In general, effective navigation requires that the agent explicitly reason about portions of the environment it has not yet seen. But the world is intractably complex; exhaustively enumerating all environment configurations is impossible. Instead, we imbue an agent with the ability to more tractably make predictions about uncertainty by changing the way in which it represents its surroundings and the actions it uses to define navigation. This thesis makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Learned Subgoal Planning, a decision-making paradigm that leverages high-level actions to make tractable predictions about unknown space via supervised learning and enable efficient computation of expected cost. Second, we apply recent progress in image-to-image translation to the task of domain adaptation for image data, allowing an agent to transfer knowledge acquired in simulation to the real world. Finally, we introduce a learned pseudosensor and accompanying probabilistic sensor model that estimates sparse structure in view of an agent from monocular images. Fusing these estimates during …",
