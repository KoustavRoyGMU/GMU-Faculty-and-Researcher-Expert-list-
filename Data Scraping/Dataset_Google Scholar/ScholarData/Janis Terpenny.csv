A comparative study on machine learning algorithms for smart manufacturing: tool wear prediction using random forests,"Dazhong Wu, Connor Jennings, Janis Terpenny, Robert X Gao, Soundar Kumara",2017/7/1,Journal Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering,"Manufacturers have faced an increasing need for the development of predictive models that predict mechanical failures and the remaining useful life (RUL) of manufacturing systems or components. Classical model-based or physics-based prognostics often require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest to develop closed-form mathematical models. However, prior knowledge of system behavior is not always available, especially for complex manufacturing systems and processes. To complement model-based prognostics, data-driven methods have been increasingly applied to machinery prognostics and maintenance management, transforming legacy manufacturing systems into smart manufacturing systems with artificial intelligence. While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of data-driven methods, most of these prognostic methods are based on classical machine learning …",458

An ensemble learning-based prognostic approach with degradation-dependent weights for remaining useful life prediction,"Zhixiong Li, Dazhong Wu, Chao Hu, Janis Terpenny",2019/4/1,Journal Reliability Engineering & System Safety,"Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is crucial for the implementation of predictive maintenance strategies. While significant research has been conducted in model-based and data-driven prognostics, there has been little research reported on the RUL prediction using an ensemble learning method that combines prediction results from multiple learning algorithms. The objective of this research is to introduce a new ensemble prognostics method that takes into account the effects of degradation on the accuracy of RUL prediction. Specifically, this method assigns an optimized, degradation-dependent weight to each learner (i.e., learning algorithm) such that the weighted sum of the prediction results from all the learners predicts the RULs of engineered systems with better accuracy.

The DFAD methodology concept is based on the hypothesis that product life ends because a product is unable to adapt to change. A product may be retired for myriad reasons including that it is broken, out of style, or has become inefficient due to technology obsolescence. In these cases, the product was not able to adapt to change—it was unable to self-heal, it could not modify or reconfigure to meet changing fashion needs, or it could not be upgraded, for physical or economic reasons, to utilize new technology. To address these and similar issues, we are developing the DFAD methodology.

Yet, custom low volume products and systems such as ships, submarines and aircraft can be in use for decades. Being proactive about obsolescence is critical to maintaining fully capable products and systems and satisfied customers. This paper presents an obsolescence risk measurement tool that is being developed to better predict and manage component obsolescence. Critical variables in this assessment that are precursors to a component becoming obsolete are described. A multiple regression model developed for forecasting obsolescence is presented.

Ontology-based knowledge representation for obsolescence forecasting,"Liyu Zheng, Raymond Nelson III, Janis Terpenny, Peter Sandborn",2013/3/1,Journal Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering,"The impact and pervasiveness of diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages (DMSMS) obsolescence are increasing due to rapidly advancing technologies which shorten the procurement lives of high-tech parts. For long field-life systems, this has led to an increasing disparity in the life cycle of parts as compared to the life cycle of the overall system. This disparity is challenging since obsolescence dates of parts are important to product life cycle planning. While proposed obsolescence forecasting methods have demonstrated some effectiveness, obsolescence management is a continuing challenge since current methods are very difficult to integrate with other tools and lack clear, complete, and consistent information representation. This paper presents an ontology framework to support the needs of knowledge representation for obsolescence forecasting. The formalized obsolescence forecasting …",16
A computational framework for cloud-based machine prognosis,"Peng Wang, Robert X Gao, Dazhong Wu, Janis Terpenny",2016/1/1,Journal Procedia CIRP,"Prognosis of machine degradation and failure propagation is essential to preventative maintenance scheduling and sustainable manufacturing. Emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing offer new opportunities for scaling up computing performance and capacity for machine monitoring and prognosis. This paper addresses challenges in machine prognosis due to high-speed data streaming from real-time sensing by leveraging parallel computing on the cloud. A framework for cloud-based prognosis is then presented to model the relationships between hidden machine states and sensor measurements under varying operating conditions and maintenance actions. To account for uncertainties associated with model representation and/or measurement quality, each relationship is modeled as a probability distribution and estimated through either model-based (e.g. particle filtering) or …",15
Interactive preference incorporation in evolutionary engineering design,"Jiachuan Wang, Janis P Terpenny",2005,Journal Knowledge Incorporation in Evolutionary Computation,"This chapter presents an approach that takes advantage of the different roles that computers and humans play in an interactive engineering design environment. It draws on the positive features of learning-oriented methods and searching-oriented methods, thus adapting design trade-off strategy when more precise preference information is learned during the evolutionary search process. The rationale and advantages of evaluating design fitness based on a fuzzy-set based preference aggregation are provided, which not only relies on specifying parameters about importance weights of different design attributes, but also the degree of compensation among them. The designers’ preferences are elicited, and the parameter learning of the preference aggregation function is implemented in an artificial neural network. Guided by online adaptive fitness evaluation, the current favorable solution set is generated …",15
Improving learning and engagement for students in large classes,"Richard Goff, Janis Terpenny, Terry Wildman",2007/10/10,"Conference 2007 37th Annual Frontiers In Education Conference-Global Engineering: Knowledge Without Borders, Opportunities Without Passports","Due to increasing student enrollments and limited resources, small classes are evermore being replaced with large lectures. It is therefore essential to quality educational programs to address the challenges of student learning and engagement in large classes. This paper explains connections between basic learning research and practical strategies for engaging students in large engineering classrooms. First, we ground proposed instructional strategies with theory and empirical evidence on such key matters as how students represent ideas in memory, how these representations are elaborated and perfected over time, and how stored information can be retrieved for use.

Entitled “Senior Design Projects to Aid the Disabled,” the capstone sequence includes close collaborations with the Lemelson Assistive Technology Development Center (LATDC) at Hampshire College and Adaptive Design Services (ADS) under the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation (DMR). The new design course allows students to work directly with collaborators and disabled clients to solve specific assistive technology design problems. Through these projects, students enhance and reinforce concepts learned in their engineering education. At the conclusion of the sequence, each student will have conceived, modeled, analyzed, and built a functional prototype of a mechanical and/or electromechanical device that satisfies the specific need of an individual client. Early results of merging engineering education and an area of social significance have been very positive. Students have welcomed both the hands-on and personal contribution aspects of their projects. In many cases, projects have led to research extensions, additional community connections, and for many students, inspiration to continue with graduate studies. The objective of this paper is to report on the motivation, design, and results of the capstone course sequence in assistive technology.

Bridging theory and practice in a senior level robotics course for mechanical and electrical engineers,"Ping Ren, Dennis Hong, Janis Terpenny, Richard Goff",2009/6/14,Conference 2009 Annual Conference & Exposition,"As a diverse discipline, robotics is a synthesis of a variety of subjects such as kinematics, dynamics, controls, mechatronics, mechanical design, artificial intelligence etc. The crossover of multiple areas makes the instruction of robotics courses a challenging task. Traditional robotics courses in mechanical and electrical engineering mainly focus on the analysis and modeling of classical robotic systems such as a two-to-six degrees of freedom robotic manipulator arm or a simple wheeled mobile robot. However, as more and more new branches of robotics are emerging in recent years (nanorobotics, biology-inspired robots and so on), it has become clear that materials covered in traditional robotics courses are not sufficient for students to solve new problems or create new robotic systems. It is therefore imperative that robotics courses be updated, and in many cases, redesigned to account for new branches of robotics that call on students to be competent in the theoretical underpinnings and also have the skills and confidence to apply these to real applications demanded by current practice. This paper first introduces the importance of robotics courses in the curricula of engineering programs, followed by results of a survey that reports on the features of robotics courses in several universities in the United States. The difficulties of designing a robotics course are then addressed. Finally, a suggested structure of a senior level robotics course is proposed.",10

Commercially available KBE systems offer a variety of development languages and interfaces for this purpose. While offering the potential for great savings, these systems frequently require substantial setup to be successful. Companies that do not succeed with KBE technologies fail either because of excessive time invested with limited return or because of lack of knowledge engineering skills. Applying one’s knowledge comes as second nature to many. Discovering, describing, and capturing this knowledge is difficult.

Feature based design evaluation for machine/tool selection for sheet metal,"Janis P Terpenny, Bartholomew O Nnaji",1993/12/1,Conference Proceedings of the 2nd Industrial Engineering Research Conference,"Research has shown that product design dictates 70% of product cost and 60% of product quality. In today's globally competitive environment, it is therefore imperative to minimize costs and reduce time to market for new products. This requires minimizing the design to manufacture cycle time, and creating designs which have considered life-cycle issues. In particular, the incorporation of manufacturing considerations early in the design process offer the potential for substantial savings in both time and costs. The process by which machines and tools are selected is part of this design consideration. This paper presents a framework for design evaluation of sheet metal products for machine/tool selections. The method is based on design feature information and an object oriented approach for the translation of design features to manufacturing features. This portion of the process plan will serve to inform the designer early in the design process of costly manufacturing requirements.",10
Sensor selection framework for designing fault diagnostics system,"Amol Kulkarni, Janis Terpenny, Vittaldas Prabhu",2021/9/28,Journal Sensors,"In a world of rapidly changing technologies, reliance on complex engineered systems has become substantial. Interactions associated with such systems as well as associated manufacturing processes also continue to evolve and grow in complexity. Consider how the complexity of manufacturing processes makes engineered systems vulnerable to cascading and escalating failures; truly a highly complex and evolving system of systems. Maintaining quality and reliability requires considerations during product development, manufacturing processes, and more. Monitoring the health of the complex system while in operation/use is imperative. These considerations have compelled designers to explore fault-mechanism models and to develop corresponding countermeasures. Increasingly, there has been a reliance on embedded sensors to aid in prognosticating failures, to reduce downtime, during manufacture and system operation. However, the accuracy of estimating the remaining useful life of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the data obtained. This can be enhanced by increasing the number of sensors used, according to information theory. However, adding sensors increases total costs with the cost of the sensors and the costs associated with information-gathering procedures. Determining the optimal number of sensors, associated operating and data acquisition costs, and sensor-configuration are nontrivial. It is also imperative to avoid redundant information due to the presence of additional sensors and the efficient display of information to the decision-maker. Therefore, it is necessary to select a subset of sensors that not only …",9

One cause is the"" leaky pipeline""; even after women and minorities choose to major in engineering, they drop out at rates higher than their counterparts along all career stages (undergraduate school, graduate school, tenure-track, etc.). Their small numbers creates isolation that has the unfortunate risks of struggle, less professional success, less sense of personal belonging, and less retention. Our hypothesis is that building a community that provides networking and support, opportunities for collaboration, and professional development, will lead to greater career success, personal fulfillment and professional happiness, retention, and greater participation/contribution from women and minorities. The authors have been conducting a series of workshops aimed at broadening participation of women and other minorities within the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Design Engineering Division (DED).

Forecasting obsolescence risk using machine learning,"Connor Jennings, Dazhong Wu, Janis Terpenny",2016/6/27,Conference International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference,"With rapid innovation in the electronics industry, product obsolescence forecasting has become increasingly important. More accurate obsolescence forecasting would have cost reduction effects in product design and part procurement over a product’s lifetime.

Taxonomy of factors for lifetime buy,"Connor Jennings, Janis P Terpenny",2015,Journal IIE Annual Conference. Proceedings,"As products become more electronically complex and component lifecycles are shortened due to rapidly changing technologies, obsolescence management has become a challenging problem associated with sustainable products. One of the most common strategies to manage obsolescence is to purchase enough components to sustain the product over its life in operation. This strategy is known as lifetime buy. Purchasing components for the life of a product depends on satisfying demand, as well as maintaining the product in the context of its use within larger complex products or systems. Firms must also consider manufacturing systems and support systems that were built for the product. Component loss due to damage or expiration in storage and scrap during manufacturing also contribute to lifetime buy quantities. Product support systems, such as warranties and product replacement programs, can consume a portion of lifetime buy reserves and lead to unsatisfied demand from customers. This paper takes on optimizing lifetime buy decisions by investigating the myriad of factors impacting total costs. A taxonomy is put forward that provides the basis for a comprehensive decision support tool, capable of assisting lifetime buy quantity decisions over the product lifecycle.",5

Modeling constraints in design refresh planning,"Raymond Nelson III, Peter Sandborn, Janis P Terpenny, Liyu Zheng",2011/1/1,Conference International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference,"When an original equipment manufacturer no longer supplies and/or supports a product then the product is considered to be obsolete. Obsolescence is a significant problem for systems whose operational and support life is much longer than the procurement lifetimes of their constituent components. Unlike high-volume, commercial products, which are quickly evolved, long field life, low-volume systems, such as aircraft may require updates of their components and technology called design refreshes to simply remain manufacturable and supportable. However these systems can’t perform design refreshes all the time due to the high nonrecurring and re-qualification costs. One approach to optimally managing this problem is to use DRP (Design Refresh Planning), which is a strategic method for scheduling design refreshes such that the life cycle cost impact of obsolescence is minimized.

Product platforms enable the planned development and deployment of families of related products whereas a traditional design processes optimize on a single design. Product family design places an increased emphasis on management of information due to the reuse aspect of having a platform. This has prompted a multi-pronged collaborative research effort by four universities that covers many facets of the product platform realm. The National Science Foundation’s Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program was one of these research efforts. The REU Program gave five students from the four universities the opportunity to discover platform design and participate in ongoing research between the four universities. The students spent a month each at Bucknell University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute dissecting products designed with a platform approach and applying novel design metrics. The students worked closely with professors, post-doctoral students, graduate students, and other undergraduate students on the topic while also expanding their interests in graduate school. This paper is a reflection on the research, the structure of the REU program, and the students’ overall experience.

To address this issue, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to examine the probabilistic relationships among sensor signals, remaining useful life (RUL), and health indices. Based on the graphical model, three types of conditional probabilistic autoencoders are combined to develop the health indices of a complex aero-propulsion system.

Receiver operating characteristic analysis for forecasting obsolescence risk,"Connor Jennings, Dazhong Wu, Janis Terpenny",2017,Journal IIE Annual Conference. Proceedings,"In today’s world of rapidly advancing technologies, the impacts and costs of change on products and systems are dramatic. As new products are introduced into the market, manufacturers cease production of older products. These products that are no longer procurable have become obsolete. Planning ahead for when products become obsolete requires accurate and dependable forecasting methods as well as methods to assess costs associated with obsolescence. Currently, obsolescence risk forecasting models assign statuses of procurable or discontinued to parts to denote the part’s availability. As with any forecast, some parts will be mislabeled, ie, a procurable part may be labeled as discontinued or vice versa. Typically, it is assumed the cost of a type I and type II errors are equal. However, a procurable part labeled as discontinued may trigger a premature redesign and potentially worse, a discontinued part labeled as procurable could cause a starved manufacturing line or even production shutdowns. The objective of this paper is to present a new method that has been developed to avoid significant errors in cost calculations and resultant decisions. The method makes use of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis that makes it possible to account for asymmetric costs when parts are misclassified. A case study of the digital camera market is presented to demonstrate the method. When a new optimal risk cut-off threshold is calculated using ROC analysis, an average reduction of 26.4% in cost per prediction in the camera market is demonstrated.",3

An Inter University Collaborative Undergraduate Research Learning Experience For Product Platform Planning,"Timothy Simpson, Robert Stone, Steve Shooter, Janis Terpenny, Soundar Kumara",2005/6/12,Conference 2005 Annual Conference,"Product Platform Planning is an emerging philosophy that calls for the planned development and deployment of families of related products. It is markedly different from the traditional product development process, which focuses on optimized designs for individual products. Product family planning places a much higher demand on management of information of multiple types and from multiple sources. In response, researchers at four universities are collaborating on the development of an information technology infrastructure to support product platform planning. This is a relatively new development in engineering design that is typically not part of the undergraduate education; therefore, we see an intrinsic relationship between the need for integrating the development of research directly with educational enhancements to teach students about these concepts. This paper describes an undergraduate research/learning experience where students from each of the participating institutions worked collaboratively in support of the overall research project. To enhance the students’ education, they spent several weeks in a focused experience at two of the universities with visits to the others. The intent was to broaden their perspectives on the operations at different schools and promote interest in graduate school while learning about product platform planning.

The engineering economics of energy use and capital investment,"Janis Terpenny, Lawrence Ambs, John Dixon, Julia Sullivan, William Sullivan",2003/6/22,Conference 2003 Annual Conference,"A potential capital investment involving energy use or energy conservation is always in competition with other possible uses of the same available capital. The competition may come from other energy related projects, or from proposals for, say new production equipment. The situation of “Pay Now-Save Later” is common for energy related decision problems. The comparison of competing energy-related projects is often complicated with unequal useful lives and typically includes substantial initial investments and a variety of recurring costs. Methods of comparison that are frequently used include payback period, return on investment (ROI), and net present value. Further, unit costing methods are needed to account for unit costs of electricity and steam, and are used to determine incremental change in the busbar price of electricity that is sold to consumers (ie, the price of electricity from the plant excluding outside factors such as transmission lines or local distribution services). Clearly, energy use and energy related capital investment decisions require good skills in economic analysis. They also provide intuitive and rich examples for teaching the basics of engineering economics. This paper provides a primer that can be used to teach the basic principles of economic analysis necessary to understand and evaluate energy-related alternatives.

An ontological model and method for obsolescence resolution and management,"Liyu Zheng, Peter A Sandborn, Janis Terpenny, Nihal Orfi",2014,"Publisher DEStech Publications, Inc.","With today's rapid advancement in technologies, commercial high tech components are rendered obsolete more frequently. Such components are often parts of long-life products. Hence, technology obsolescence can make design changes for systems expensive and result in high life-cycle costs. Several tools have been developed to support obsolescence management. While these tools provide benefits and serve as focal points for information related to components, these tools are limited in many respects due to data conflicts, incompleteness and inconsistency. Further, the lack of communication between these tools compounds the limitations making the proactive management of obsolescence even more challenging. This paper addresses gaps in existing tools, by providing a framework capable of integrating heterogeneous sources of information and knowledge that are required to resolve and manage obsolescence. This is implemented through an obsolescence resolution ontological model developed using the ontology editor Protégé. A reasoning method is used to query obsolescence information and resolution strategies to support decision-making.

For example, ontology development requires a significant amount of repeated steps. And, once developed, ontologies need to be completely, consistently and correctly described in a hierarchy. Further, ontologies also need to be maintained regularly to keep them consistent with changes in domain knowledge and data sources. Facing these challenges, this paper puts forward a method to automatically develop and maintain ontologies, and a method to optimize these ontologies through identifying potential relationships among distributed ontologies. By using these methods …",2
Bridging theory and practice in a dual level robotics course for mechanical and electrical engineers,"Ping Ren, Dennis Hong, Janis Terpenny, Richard Goff",2010/10/1,Journal Computers in Education Journal,"As a diverse discipline, robotics is a synthesis of a variety of subjects such as kinematics, dynamics, controls, mechatronics, mechanical design, artificial intelligence etc. The crossover of multiple areas makes the instruction of robotics courses a challenging task. Traditional robotics courses in mechanical and electrical engineering mainly focus on the analysis and modeling of classical robotic systems such as a two-to-six degrees of freedom serial robotic manipulator or a simple wheeled mobile robot. However, as more and more new branches of robotics are emerging in recent years (biologyinspired robots, nanorobotics and so on), it has become clear that materials covered in traditional robotics courses are not sufficient for students to solve new problems or create new robotic systems. It is therefore imperative that robotics courses be updated, and in many cases, redesigned to account for new branches of robotics that call on students to be competent in the theoretical underpinnings and also have the skills and confidence to apply these to real applications demanded by current practice. This paper first introduces the importance of robotics courses in the curriculum of engineering programs, followed by results of a survey that reports on the features of robotics courses in several universities in the United States and a few other countries. The difficulties of designing a robotics course are then addressed. Finally, the structure of a new graduate/senior dual level robotics course is presented, including preliminary results and opportunities for future work.",2

An approach to address independence of criteria in multi-attribute decision-making,"Yanfeng Li, Ni Hu, Janis Terpenny",2009,Journal IIE Annual Conference. Proceedings,"In multi-criteria decision making, it is common to make use of weighted sum approaches that include steps such as identifying the criteria options; identifying the weights of each criterion; rating the options against the criteria; multiplying by the weighting; and summing over the weighted criteria. In the options criteria rating process, it is assumed that the criteria are independent and mutually exclusive. This method is commonly used and widely accepted, but its limitation is that in some cases, the independence assumption does not hold among criteria or it is difficult to identify a set of mutually independent criteria. The ignorance of higher-order interaction among criteria may lead to unreasonable option choices, especially when the power of higher-order interaction is very strong. Thus the cross effect of criteria will play an important role in this type of decision making analysis. In this paper, the Consistent Weight …",2

Clustering design structure matrices: A comparison of methods using minimum description length,"Amol Kulkarni, Connor Jennings, Michael Hoffman, Erica Blanco, Janis P Terpenny, Timothy Simpson",2018,Journal IIE Annual Conference.

Design Structure Matrices (DSMs) are often used to represent the relationships between every component or subsystem in a product. The complex network of interactions can then be clustered into subassemblies and other hierarchies, aiding designers in making critical decisions that will impact assembly, maintenance, and end-of-life disposal. This paper explores three methods for clustering components in a DSM to create a modular product architecture:(1) genetic algorithm,(2) hierarchical clustering, and (3) divisive clustering using a graph. A discussion on each algorithm is followed by an industrial example. This paper leads to the conclusion that genetic algorithm is better at identifying complex structures like bus module, 3D structure and overlapping cluster whereas hierarchical and divisive clustering are computationally inexpensive and are able to find optimal DSMs faster than the genetic algorithm.",1

Leveraging Active Learning for Failure Mode Acquisition,"Amol Kulkarni, Janis Terpenny, Vittaldas Prabhu",2023/3/4,Journal Sensors,"Identifying failure modes is an important task to improve the design and reliability of a product and can also serve as a key input in sensor selection for predictive maintenance. Failure mode acquisition typically relies on experts or simulations which require significant computing resources. With the recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), efforts have been made to automate this process. However, it is not only time consuming, but extremely challenging to obtain maintenance records that list failure modes. Unsupervised learning methods such as topic modeling, clustering, and community detection are promising approaches for automatic processing of maintenance records to identify failure modes. However, the nascent state of NLP tools combined with incompleteness and inaccuracies of typical maintenance records pose significant technical challenges. As a step towards addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a framework in which online active learning is used to identify failure modes from maintenance records. Active learning provides a semi-supervised machine learning approach, allowing for a human in the training stage of the model. The hypothesis of this paper is that the use of a human to annotate part of the data and train a machine learning model to annotate the rest is more efficient than training unsupervised learning models. Results demonstrate that the model is trained with annotating less than ten percent of the total available data. The framework is able to achieve ninety percent (90%) accuracy in the identification of failure modes in test cases with an F-1 score of 0.89. This paper also demonstrates the …",

A Decision-Level Data Fusion Approach to Surface Roughness Prediction,"Yupeng Wei, Dazhong Wu, Janis Terpenny",2019/6/10,Conference International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference,"To improve the quality of additively manufactured parts, it is crucial to develop real-time process monitoring systems and data-driven predictive models. While various sensor- and image-based process monitoring methods have been developed to improve the quality of additively manufactured parts, very limited research has been conducted to predict surface roughness. To fill this gap, this paper presents a decision-level data fusion approach to predicting surface roughness in the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process. The predictive models are trained by the random forests method using multiple sensor signals. A decision-level data fusion method is introduced to integrate sensor data sources. Experimental results have shown that the decision-level data fusion approach can predict surface roughness in FDM with high accuracy.",
Optimal Taxing Strategy to Increase Competitiveness of Renewable Energy Utility Suppliers,"Zvikomborero Matenga, Johannes Fedderke, Janis Terpenny",2019,Journal IIE Annual Conference. Proceedings,"The effects of climate change are starting to have an economic impact on developing economies. The heavy use of fossil fuels and the high investments costs required to utilize renewable energy sources in electricity generation exacerbates this problem by limiting entry of renewable energy sources. Unlike subsidies, implementing an optimal taxing policy on conventional energy sources can mitigate the competitive disadvantage of renewable source in terms without placing a steeper financial burden on the government. The main objective of this project is to determine an optimal taxing strategy that minimizes social costs due conventional energy sources and the optimal pricing strategies implemented by competing firms where the incumbent firm uses conventional energy sources and the entrant firm introduces renewable energy sources. The demands rates for both services does not only depend on the price …",

The approach is based on digital image correlation and involves characterization of surface speeds during rigid body rotation of the workpiece, followed by normalization with respect to rotation speed. Towards this, two different imaging sources were tested, viz. smartphone camera and sophisticated high-resolution/high-speed camera. The proposed approach successfully delineated horizontal and vertical notch defects in a simple FDM fabricated component. Accuracy of this approach was tested with concomitant laser based scanning. Some limitations of this approach were discussed.",
Pricing dynamics of electricity in privatized markets with underdeveloped networks,"Zvikomborero Matenga, Johannes Fedderke, Janis Terpenny",2018,Journal IIE Annual Conference.

The challenge is on which pricing strategy to implement to maximize long run profits. In addition, developing countries face a monopolistic market design and low levels of electricity access. To address these challenges, this work seeks to identify the pricing strategy for the utility players facing in a competitive market. We investigate the pricing and network dynamics of a rational profit maximization entrant utility competing with a profit maximizing dominant incumbent. Each utility seeks to identify a pricing path that maximizes its long run profits by increasing its network size. Using optimal control theory, the problem is modeled as a dynamic differential game; in this case, a Nash differential game. The variables of choice are the price and the …",

In order to determine the importance of variables which impact a film's success, a prediction model is needed. One approach is to identify communities within the network to predict a movie's success variables such as revenue, winning awards, and ratings. This study focuses on network clustering to identify communities within a large network of movies and actors. The network investigated in this work is a type of collaboration network in which movies are connected to each other if they share at least one actor together. The results indicate how we can identify and use these communities to determine the key attributes which lead to movies' success.

A Study of Correlation Between DMSMS Obsolescence and Counterfeit Electronics,"Liyu Zheng, Nihal Orfi, Janis Terpenny",2014/8/17,Conference International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference,"Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) obsolescence of components and subsystems is a risk driver for long field -life defense systems such as aircraft, ships and avionics. Over their life in service, a substantial number of components required to produce and support such systems will become no longer available from the Original Component Manufacturers. There are different approaches to manage DMSMS obsolescence, some of which lead to the purchase of replacement parts from unreliable sources, hence, providing an opportunity for the infiltration of counterfeit parts. Counterfeits can contaminate the part supply source, further magnifying the obsolescence problem. Validating and understanding the correlation between obsolescence and counterfeits are important and necessary steps to improve decision-making and the management of both obsolescence and counterfeits.

Ontology-Based Knowledge Representation for Product Life Cycle Concepts and Obsolescence Forecasting,"Liyu Zheng, Janis Terpenny, Raymond Nelson III, Peter Sandborn",2011,Journal IIE Annual Conference. Proceedings,"The impact and pervasiveness of product obsolescence are increasing due to rapidly advancing technologies which shorten the lives of high-technology components. For long field-life systems, this has led to an increasing disparity in the life cycle of components as compared to the life cycle of the overall system. This disparity is challenging since obsolescence dates of components are important to product life cycle planning. While proposed obsolescence forecasting methods have demonstrated some effectiveness, obsolescence management is a continuing challenge since current methods are very difficult to integrate with other tools and lack clear, complete, and consistent information representation. This paper presents a framework to support the needs of knowledge representation for obsolescence forecasting. Product life cycle models are represented using the logic of ontological constructs.

Context Based Problems and Exercises For Teaching Engineering Economy,"Rajkamal Kesharwani, Xiaomeng Chang, Janis Terpenny",2008/6/22,Conference 2008 Annual Conference & Exposition,"Traditionally, methods of teaching engineering economy draw on resources such as textbooks 1-5, websites 6 and papers 7. Often, engineering economy courses follow the ‘given this, find that’style of exercises to introduce and reinforce basic concepts. Developing examples and exercises that are interesting, engaging, and provide context is a challenging problem for courses with students enrolled from a variety of majors. Yet, we know that without proper context to their discipline, students will not find relevance or understand why they should care to learn engineering economy. To students it may be just another course to check off the requirements list. Further, students from disciplines other than industrial engineering (IE) often learn engineering economy as part of another required course within their discipline. For example, mechanical engineers will be introduced to engineering economy concepts in an introductory or senior course in engineering design. For this situation, non-IE students typically do not purchase a textbook in engineering economy, but rely on instructor provided materials.",

Undergraduate Learning Experiences Through Research In Emerging Areas Of Engineering Design: Product Platform Planning And Design For Managing Product Obsolescence,"Rahul Rai, Asli Sahin, Ashley Studd, Janis Terpenny",2007/6/24,Conference 2007 Annual Conference & Exposition,"In this paper, we present the learning experiences of six undergraduates who worked on research projects in the areas of product family and product obsolescence. These areas represent emerging fields in product design. Product platforms enable the planned development and deployment of families of related products whereas traditional design processes optimize on a single design. Design for Managing Product Obsolescence (DfMPO) helps in mitigating and preventing obsolescence of products due to rapid change in technology, thus promoting sustainability. Both product platform and DfMPO place an increased emphasis on management of information due to the reuse of design knowledge. The REU program gave the six students the opportunity to discover design principles and knowledge related to platform design and DfMPO. The students spent a semester applying novel design knowledge representation and visualization techniques to plan product platforms and design principles to prevent product obsolescence.

A group technology based representation for product portfolios,"Michael Van Wie, Robert B Stone, Jiachuan Wang, Janis P Terpenny, Robert L Jordan",2005,Publisher American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),"Repository based applications for portfolio design offer the potential for leveraging archived design data with computational searches. Toward the development of such search tools, we present a representation for product portfolios that is an extension of an existing Group Technology (GT) coding scheme. Relevance to portfolio design is treated with a case study example of a hand held grinder design. Results of this work provide a numerical coding representation that captures function, form, material and manufacturing data for systems. This extends the current GT line work by combining these four types of design data and clarifying the use of the functional basis in a GT code. The results serve as a useful starting point for the development of portfolio design algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, that account for this combination of design information.",

Interactive Preference Incorporation in User-Centered Product Development,"Jiachuan Wang, Janis P Terpenny, Bartholomew O Nnaji",2004,Journal IIE Annual Conference. Proceedings,"This paper presents an approach that takes advantage of the different roles that computers and humans play in an interactive engineering design environment. It draws on the positive features of learning-oriented methods and searching-oriented methods, thus adapting design trade-off strategy when more precise preference information is learned during the evolutionary search process. The rationale and advantages of evaluating design fitness based on a fuzzy-set based preference aggregation are provided, which not only relies on specifying parameters about importance weights of different design attributes, but also the degree of compensation among them. The designers' preferences are elicited, and the parameter learning of the preference aggregation function is implemented in an artificial neural network. Guided by online adaptive fitness evaluation, the current favorable solution set is generated by means …",

As design stages progress in a changing environment, the trade-off strategy could also change when more information is added. In this paper, fuzzy set-based trade-off strategy, which typically relies on specifying parameters about importance weights and degree of compensation among design attributes, is applied to address imprecision in the early stage of design. This paper provides descriptions of a neural network parameter learning method of function approximation to adapt trade-off strategies according to current preference information available from the designer's feedback. As the design process evolves, this adaptation should lead to more suitable and stabilized trade-off strategies. A case study experiment is included to demonstrate the approach.",

Harnessing Product Complexity: Step 1-Establishing Product Complexity Dimensions and Indicators,"Janis Terpenny, Asli Sahin-Sariisik","With today’s level of market competition and demand for diverse product offerings, more companies are now pressured to increase product variety as a strategy to maintain and increase market share. In addition to its associated direct costs, variety is considered the main source of product complexity, which has been proven to negatively impact product development time, productivity, costs and customer satisfaction.Although several researchers have tackled the issue, product complexity continues to be a theoretical concept with different definitions and measurements established based on research area, scope and objective. This lack of a unified approach has made it difficult for companies to take full advantage of existing research to manage the impact of product complexity. This paper introduces five main dimensions of product complexity based on identifying different complexity sources in product design, development, manufacturing, assembly and supply chain, and on understanding the impact of these sources on different direct and indirect costs. Establishing the dimensions of product complexity is an essential first step in developing a unified product complexity metric, to be used as a support tool to improve product design and systematically manage product complexity.","Scholar articles Harnessing Product Complexity: Step 1-Establishing Product Complexity Dimensions and IndicatorsJ Terpenny, A Sahin-SariisikRelated articles ","With today’s level of market competition and demand for diverse product offerings, more companies are now pressured to increase product variety as a strategy to maintain and increase market share.
