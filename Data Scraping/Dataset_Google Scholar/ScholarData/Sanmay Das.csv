"Filters, wrappers and a boosting-based hybrid for feature selection",Sanmay Das,2001/6/28,Journal Icml,"In this paper, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of filter and wrapper methods for feature selection and propose a new hybrid algorithm that uses boosting and incorporates some of the features of wrapper methods into a fast filter method for feature selection. Empirical results are reported on six real-world datasets from the UCI repository, showing that our hybrid algorithm is competitive with wrapper methods while being much faster, and scales well to datasets with thousands of features.",895
Risk and risk management in the credit card industry,"Florentin Butaru, Qingqing Chen, Brian Clark, Sanmay Das, Andrew W Lo, Akhtar Siddique",2016/11/1,Journal Journal of Banking & Finance,"Using account-level credit card data from six major commercial banks from January 2009 to December 2013, we apply machine-learning techniques to combined consumer tradeline, credit bureau, and macroeconomic variables to predict delinquency. In addition to providing accurate measures of loss probabilities and credit risk, our models can also be used to analyze and compare risk management practices and the drivers of delinquency across banks. We find substantial heterogeneity in risk factors, sensitivities, and predictability of delinquency across banks, implying that no single model applies to all six institutions. We measure the efficacy of a bank's risk management process by the percentage of delinquent accounts that a bank manages effectively, and find that efficacy also varies widely across institutions. These results suggest the need for a more customized approached to the supervision and regulation …",225
Solving homelessness from a complex systems perspective: insights for prevention responses,"Patrick J Fowler, Peter S Hovmand, Katherine E Marcal, Sanmay Das",2019/4/1,Source Annual review of public health,"Homelessness represents an enduring public health threat facing communities across the developed world. Children, families, and marginalized adults face life course implications of housing insecurity, while communities struggle to address the extensive array of needs within heterogeneous homeless populations. Trends in homelessness remain stubbornly high despite policy initiatives to end homelessness. A complex systems perspective provides insights into the dynamics underlying coordinated responses to homelessness. A constant demand for housing assistance strains service delivery, while prevention efforts remain inconsistently implemented in most countries. Feedback processes challenge efficient service delivery. A system dynamics model tests assumptions of policy interventions for ending homelessness.

Two-Sided Bandits and the Dating Market.,"Sanmay Das, Emir Kamenica",2005/8,Journal IJCAI,"We study the decision problems facing agents in repeated matching environments with learning, or two-sided bandit problems, and examine the dating market, in which men and women repeatedly go out on dates and learn about each other, as an example. We consider three natural matching mechanisms and empirically examine properties of these mechanisms, focusing on the asymptotic stability of the resulting matchings when the agents use a simple learning rule coupled with an ϵ-greedy exploration policy. Matchings tend to be more stable when agents are patient in two different ways—if they are more likely to explore early or if they are more optimistic. However, the two forms of patience do not interact well in terms of increasing the probability of stable outcomes. We also define a notion of regret for the two-sided problem and study the distribution of regrets under the different matching mechanisms.",76
A learning market-maker in the Glosten–Milgrom model,Sanmay Das*,2005/4/1,Journal Quantitative Finance,"This paper develops a model of a learning market-maker by extending the Glosten–Milgrom model of dealer markets. The market-maker tracks the changing true value of a stock in settings with informed traders (with noisy signals) and liquidity traders, and sets bid and ask prices based on its estimate of the true value. We empirically evaluate the performance of the market-maker in markets with different parameter values to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, and then use the algorithm to derive properties of price processes in simulated markets. When the true value is governed by a jump process, there is a two regime behaviour marked by significant heterogeneity of information and large spreads immediately following a price jump, which is quickly resolved by the market-maker, leading to a rapid return to homogeneity of information and small spreads. We also discuss the similarities and differences …",76
"Anarchy, stability, and utopia: Creating better matchings","Elliot Anshelevich, Sanmay Das, Yonatan Naamad",2013/1/1,Journal Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems,"Historically, the analysis of matching has centered on designing algorithms to produce stable matchings as well as on analyzing the incentive compatibility of matching mechanisms. Less attention has been paid to questions related to the social welfare of stable matchings in cardinal utility models. We examine the loss in social welfare that arises from requiring matchings to be stable, the natural equilibrium concept under individual rationality. While this loss can be arbitrarily bad under general preferences, when there is some structure to the underlying graph corresponding to natural conditions on preferences, we prove worst case bounds on the price of anarchy. Surprisingly, under simple distributions of utilities, the average case loss turns out to be significantly smaller than the worst-case analysis would suggest. Furthermore, we derive conditions for the existence of approximately stable matchings that …",74

The effects of market-making on price dynamics,Sanmay Das,2008/5/12,Book Proceedings of the 7th international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems-Volume 2,"This paper studies market-makers, agents responsible for maintaining liquidity and orderly price transitions in markets. Market-makers include major firms making markets on global stock exchanges, as well as software agents that run behind the scenes on novel electronic markets like prediction markets. We use a sophisticated model of marketmaking to build richer agent-based models of markets and show how these models can be useful both in understanding properties of existing markets and in predicting the impacts of structural changes. For example, we show how competition among market-makers can lead to significantly faster price discovery following a jump in the true value of an asset. We also show that myopic profit-maximization, apart from leading to poor market quality, is sub-optimal even for a monopolistic market-maker. This observation leads to an interesting characterization of the market-maker’s explorationexploitation dilemma as a tradeoff between price discovery and profit-taking.",59
Adapting to a market shock: Optimal sequential market-making,"Sanmay Das, Malik Magdon-Ismail",2008,Journal Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,"We study the profit-maximization problem of a monopolistic market-maker who sets two-sided prices in an asset market. The sequential decision problem is hard to solve because the state space is a function. We demonstrate that the belief state is well approximated by a Gaussian distribution. We prove a key monotonicity property of the Gaussian state update which makes the problem tractable, yielding the first optimal sequential market-making algorithm in an established model. The algorithm leads to a surprising insight: an optimal monopolist can provide more liquidity than perfectly competitive market-makers in periods of extreme uncertainty, because a monopolist is willing to absorb initial losses in order to learn a new valuation rapidly so she can extract higher profits later.",58
Allocating interventions based on predicted outcomes: A case study on homelessness services,"Amanda Kube, Sanmay Das, Patrick J Fowler",2019/7/17,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"Modern statistical and machine learning methods are increasingly capable of modeling individual or personalized treatment effects. These predictions could be used to allocate different interventions across populations based on individual characteristics. In many domains, like social services, the availability of different possible interventions can be severely resource limited. This paper considers possible improvements to the allocation of such services in the context of homelessness service provision in a major metropolitan area. Using data from the homeless system, we use a counterfactual approach to show potential for substantial benefits in terms of reducing the number of families who experience repeat episodes of homelessness by choosing optimal allocations (based on predicted outcomes) to a fixed number of beds in different types of homelessness service facilities. Such changes in the allocation mechanism would not be without tradeoffs, however; a significant fraction of households are predicted to have a higher probability of re-entry in the optimal allocation than in the original one. We discuss the efficiency, equity and fairness issues that arise and consider potential implications for policy.",56
Coordinated Versus Decentralized Exploration In Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits.,"Mithun Chakraborty, Kai Yee Phoebe Chua, Sanmay Das, Brendan Juba",2017/8/19,Conference IJCAI,"In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent multiarmed bandit-based model for ad hoc teamwork with expensive communication. The goal of the team is to maximize the total reward gained from pulling arms of a bandit over a number of epochs. In each epoch, each agent decides whether to pull an arm, or to broadcast the reward it obtained in the previous epoch to the team and forgo pulling an arm. These decisions must be made only on the basis of the agent’s private information and the public information broadcast prior to that epoch. We first benchmark the achievable utility by analyzing an idealized version of this problem where a central authority has complete knowledge of rewards acquired from all arms in all epochs and uses a multiplicative weights update algorithm for allocating arms to agents. We then introduce an algorithm for the decentralized setting that uses a value-ofinformation based communication strategy and an exploration-exploitation strategy based on the centralized algorithm, and show experimentally that it converges rapidly to the performance of the centralized method.",53
Predicting charitable donations using social media,"Rostyslav Korolov, Justin Peabody, Allen Lavoie, Sanmay Das, Malik Magdon-Ismail, William Wallace",2016/12,Journal Social Network Analysis and Mining,"We study the relationship between chatter on social media and observed actions concerning charitable donation. One hypothesis is that a fraction of those who act will also tweet about it, implying a linear relation. However, if the contagion is present, we expect a superlinear scaling. We consider two scenarios: donations in response to a natural disaster, and regular donations. We empirically validate the model using two location-paired sets of social media and donation data, corresponding to the two scenarios. Results show a quadratic relation between chatter and action in emergency response case. In case of regular donations, we observe a near-linear relation. Additionally, regular donations can be explained by demographic factors, while for a disaster response social media is a much better predictor of action. A contagion model is used to predict the near-quadratic scaling for the disaster response …",53
Manipulation among the arbiters of collective intelligence: How Wikipedia administrators mold public opinion,"Sanmay Das, Allen Lavoie, Malik Magdon-Ismail",2016/12/24,Journal ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),"Our reliance on networked, collectively built information is a vulnerability when the quality or reliability of this information is poor. Wikipedia, one such collectively built information source, is often our first stop for information on all kinds of topics; its quality has stood up to many tests, and it prides itself on having a “neutral point of view.” Enforcement of neutrality is in the hands of comparatively few, powerful administrators. In this article, we document that a surprisingly large number of editors change their behavior and begin focusing more on a particular controversial topic once they are promoted to administrator status. The conscious and unconscious biases of these few, but powerful, administrators may be shaping the information on many of the most sensitive topics on Wikipedia; some may even be explicitly infiltrating the ranks of administrators in order to promote their own points of view.

A Bayesian market maker,"Aseem Brahma, Mithun Chakraborty, Sanmay Das, Allen Lavoie, Malik Magdon-Ismail",2012/6/4,Conference Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce,"Ensuring sufficient liquidity is one of the key challenges for designers of prediction markets. Variants of the logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR) have emerged as the standard. LMSR market makers are loss-making in general and need to be subsidized. Proposed variants, including liquidity sensitive market makers, suffer from an inability to react rapidly to jumps in population beliefs. In this paper we propose a Bayesian Market Maker for binary outcome (or continuous 0-1) markets that learns from the informational content of trades. By sacrificing the guarantee of bounded loss, the Bayesian Market Maker can simultaneously offer: (1) significantly lower expected loss at the same level of liquidity, and, (2) rapid convergence when there is a jump in the underlying true value of the security.

The optimal allocation of COVID-19 vaccines,"Ana Babus, Sanmay Das, SangMok Lee",2023/3/1,Journal Economics Letters,"We develop a simple model of vaccine prioritization for a potential pandemic. We illustrate how the model applies to the case of Covid-19, using an early 2020 primitive estimate of occupation-based exposure risks and age-based infection fatality rates. Even based on primitive estimates the vaccine distribution strongly emphasizes age-based mortality risk rather than occupation-based exposure risk. Among others, our result suggests that 50-year-old food-processing workers and 60-year-old financial advisors should have been equally prioritized. We also find that the priorities minimally change when certain populations’ exposure risks are altered by targeted stay-at-home orders or call-up of essential workers.",40
The effects of feedback on human behavior in social media: An inverse reinforcement learning model,"Sanmay Das, Allen Lavoie",2014/5/5,Book Proceedings of the 2014 international conference on Autonomous agents and multi-agent systems,"We introduce and validate a learning model of human behavior change in response to feedback on social media. People who participate in these types of websites, like Wikipedia, Reddit, and others, are learning agents whose choices about how to allocate their effort are dynamic and responsive to how they feel their efforts were received in the past. By explicitly taking into account the reinforcement effects of different types of feedback received on prior contributions, our model is able to significantly outperform all known baselines in predicting future contributions both on synthetic data and on real data collected from the social news site reddit. com. Our model has an intuitive interpretation as users playing mixed strategies in a game-like setting with thousands of other users and thousands of available pure strategies. In this interpretation, our task is then inverse reinforcement learning: recovering users’ reward functions based on observed behavior.",38
Expert-mediated sequential search,"Meenal Chhabra, Sanmay Das, David Sarne",2014/5/1,Journal European Journal of Operational Research,"This paper studies markets, such as Internet marketplaces for used cars or mortgages, in which consumers engage in sequential search. In particular, we consider the impact of information-brokers (experts) who can, for a fee, provide better information on true values of opportunities. We characterize the optimal search strategy given a price and the terms of service set by the expert, and show how to use this characterization to solve the monopolist expert’s service pricing problem. Our analysis enables the investigation of three common pricing schemes (pay-per-use, unlimited subscription, and package pricing) that can be used by the expert. We demonstrate that in settings characteristic of electronic marketplaces, namely those with lower search costs for consumers and lower costs of production of expert services, unlimited subscription schemes are favored.

Learning the demand curve in posted-price digital goods auctions,"Meenal Chhabra, Sanmay Das",2011/5/2,Book The 10th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems-Volume 1,"Online digital goods auctions are settings where a seller with an unlimited supply of goods (eg music or movie downloads) interacts with a stream of potential buyers. In the posted price setting, the seller makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to each arriving buyer. We study the seller’s revenue maximization problem in posted-price auctions of digital goods. We find that algorithms from the multi-armed bandit literature like UCB, which come with good regret bounds, can be slow to converge. We propose and study two alternatives:(1) a scheme based on using Gittins indices with priors that make appropriate use of domain knowledge;(2) a new learning algorithm, LLVD, that assumes a linear demand curve, and maintains a Beta prior over the free parameter using a moment-matching approximation. LLVD is not only (approximately) optimal for linear demand, but also learns fast and performs well when the linearity assumption is violated, for example in the cases of two natural valuation distributions, exponential and log-normal.",37
Intelligent market-making in artificial financial markets,Sanmay Das,2003/6/1,"Description This thesis describes and evaluates a market-making  algorithm for setting prices in financial markets with asymmetric  information, and analyzes the properties of artificial markets in which the  algorithm is used.

On the social welfare of mechanisms for repeated batch matching,"Elliot Anshelevich, Meenal Chhabra, Matthew Gerrior, Sanmay Das",2013,Conference AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"We study hybrid online-batch matching problems, where agents arrive continuously, but are only matched in periodic rounds, when many of them can be considered simultaneously. Agents not getting matched in a given round remain in the market for the next round. This setting models several scenarios of interest, including many job markets as well as kidney exchange mechanisms. We consider the social utility of two commonly used mechanisms for such markets: one that aims for stability in each round (greedy), and one that attempts to maximize social utility in each round (max-weight). Surprisingly, we find that in the long term, the social utility of the greedy mechanism can be higher than that of the max-weight mechanism. We hypothesize that this is because the greedy mechanism behaves similarly to a soft threshold mechanism, where all connections below a certain threshold are rejected by the participants in favor of waiting until the next round. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method to approximately calculate the optimal threshold for an individual agent to use based on characteristics of the other agents participating, and demonstrate experimentally that social utility is high when all agents use this strategy. Thresholding can also be applied by the mechanism itself to improve social welfare; we demonstrate this with an example on graphs that model pairwise kidney exchange.",28

Instructor rating markets,"Mithun Chakraborty, Sanmay Das, Allen Lavoie, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Yonatan Naamad",2013,Conference AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"We describe the design of Instructor Rating Markets (IRMs) where human participants interact through intelligent automated market-makers in order to provide dynamic collective feedback to instructors on the progress of their classes. The markets are among the first to enable the empirical study of prediction markets where traders can affect the very outcomes they are trading on. More than 200 students across the Rensselaer campus participated in markets for ten classes in the Fall 2010 semester. In this paper, we describe how we designed these markets in order to elicit useful information, and analyze data from the deployment. We show that market prices convey useful information on future instructor ratings and contain significantly more information than do past ratings. The bulk of useful information contained in the price of a particular class is provided by students who are in that class, showing that the markets are serving to disseminate insider information. At the same time, we find little evidence of attempted manipulation by raters. The markets are also a laboratory for comparing different market designs and the resulting price dynamics, and we show how they can be used to compare market making algorithms.",27
The influence of social norms and social consciousness on intention reconciliation,"Barbara J Grosz, Sarit Kraus, David G Sullivan, Sanmay Das",2002/12/1,Journal Artificial Intelligence,"Research on resource-bounded agents has established that rational agents need to be able to revise their commitments in light of new opportunities.

Trading on a Rigged Game: Outcome Manipulation in Prediction Markets.,"Mithun Chakraborty, Sanmay Das",2016/1,Conference IJCAI,"Prediction markets are popular mechanisms for aggregating information about a future event. In situations where market participants may significantly influence the outcome, running the prediction market could change the incentives of participants in the process that creates the outcome. We propose a new game-theoretic model that captures two aspects of real-world prediction markets:(1) agents directly affect the outcome the market is predicting,(2) some outcome-deciders may not participate in the market. We show that this game has two types of equilibria: When some outcome-deciders are unlikely to participate in the market, equilibrium prices reveal expected market outcomes conditional on participants’ private information, whereas when all outcome-deciders are likely to participate, equilibria are collusive–agents effectively coordinate in an uninformative and untruthful way.",19

Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale difference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed micro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This paper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local spread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease between regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the spread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the spread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global spread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the local spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a simulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available data on population, population density, and traffic networks between different regions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global traffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results show that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly improve the results of modeling disease spread.",17

Strategic free information disclosure for search-based information platforms,"Shani Alkoby, David Sarne, Sanmay Das",2015/5/4,Book Proceedings of the 2015 international conference on autonomous agents and multiagent systems,"We investigate information platforms that enable and support user search. Consider users engaged in a sequential search process (eg for used cars or consumer goods in e-commerce, or partners on a dating website). Many platforms provide basic information on opportunities of interest for free, while also offering, at a price, premium services that can offer more information to the user on the potential values of different opportunities. Prior research has focused on the question of how to price such services. Here we investigate a novel strategic option: can the platform provide some of the premium services for free, and increase its profit in doing so? By analyzing game theoretic equilibria in such a model, we show that there are cases where the platform can indeed benefit by sometimes providing information for free. The underlying mechanism is that sometimes offering free services leads to more extensive usage of the expert’s paid services. A robustness analysis shows that even if the population of users is heterogeneous and a large portion of it a priori does not use the premium services, offering parts of the service for free can still be beneficial for the platform despite the potential misuse.",16

We find that gubernatorial rhetoric closely matches that of members of Congress, but that there are substantial differences in the topics and content of mayoral speech. These results suggest that, on average, American mayors have largely remained focused on their local mandate.

An agent-based model of competition between financial exchanges: Can frequent call mechanisms drive trade away from CDAs?,"Zhuoshu Li, Sanmay Das",2016/5/9,Book Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems,"In the debate over high frequency trading, the frequent call (Call) mechanism has recently received considerable attention as a proposal for replacing the continuous double auction (CDA) mechanisms that currently run most financial markets. One natural question, which has begun to spur the development of new models, is the effect of competition between platforms that use these two different mechanisms when agents can strategize over platform choice. In this paper we contribute to this nascent literature by developing an agent-based model of competition between a Call market and a CDA market. Our model incorporates patient informed traders (both high-frequency and not) who are willing to wait for order execution at their preferred price and impatient background traders who demand immediate execution. We show that there is a strong tendency for the Call market to absorb a significant fraction of trade under most equilibrium and approximate-equilibrium conditions. These equilibria typically lead to significantly higher welfare for the background traders, an important measure of social value, than the operation of an isolated CDA market.",15
Price evolution in a continuous double auction prediction market with a scoring-rule based market maker,"Mithun Chakraborty, Sanmay Das, Justin Peabody",2015/2/16,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"The logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR), the most common automated market making rule for prediction markets, is typically studied in the framework of dealer markets, where the market maker takes one side of every transaction. The continuous double auction (CDA) is a much more widely used microstructure for general financial markets in practice. In this paper, we study the properties of CDA prediction markets with zero-intelligence traders in which an LMSR-style market maker participates actively. We extend an existing idea of Robin Hanson for integrating LMSR with limit order books in order to provide a new, self-contained market making algorithm that does not need “special” access to the order book and can participate as another trader. We find that, as expected, the presence of the market maker leads to generally lower bid-ask spreads and higher trader surplus (or price improvement), but, surprisingly, does not necessarily improve price discovery and market efficiency; this latter effect is more pronounced when there is higher variability in trader beliefs.",15
When is it important to know you’ve been rejected? A search problem with probabilistic appearance of offers,"Sanmay Das, John N Tsitsiklis",2010/5/1,Journal Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization,"A problem that often arises in the process of searching for a job or for a candidate to fill a position is that applicants do not know if they will receive an offer from any given firm with which they interview, and, conversely, firms do not know whether applicants will definitely take positions they are offered. In this paper, we model the search process as an optimal stopping problem with probabilistic appearance of offers from the perspective of a single decision-maker who wants to maximize the realized value of the offer she accepts. Our main results quantify the value of information in the following sense: how much better off is the decision-maker if she knows each time whether an offer appeared or not, compared to the case where she is only informed when offers actually appear? We show that for some common distributions of offer values, she can expect to receive very close to her optimal value even in the lower …",15
Collective wisdom: Information growth in wikis and blogs,"Sanmay Das, Malik Magdon-Ismail",2010/6/7,Book Proceedings of the 11th ACM conference on Electronic commerce,"Wikis and blogs have become enormously successful media for collaborative information creation. Articles and posts accrue information through the asynchronous editing of users who arrive both seeking information and possibly able to contribute information. Most articles stabilize to high quality, trusted sources of information representing the collective wisdom of all the users who edited the article. We propose a model for information growth which relies on two main observations: (i) as an article's quality improves, it attracts visitors at a faster rate (a rich get richer phenomenon); and, simultaneously, (ii) the chances that a new visitor will improve the article drops (there is only so much that can be said about a particular topic).

On agent-based modeling of complex systems: Learning and bounded rationality,Sanmay Das,2006,"Journal Department of Computer Science and Engineering. La Jolla, CA","This paper seeks to connect the literatures from artificial intelligence, economics, and cognitive science to make the case that not only is the notion of bounded optimality from the AI literature the right goal for agent design, it can also serve as a principled means for modeling boundedly rational agents in complex systems like economic markets. While appealing, this goal leaves open two critical questions. First, bounded optimality is defined over an expected set of problems the agent might face and it is not obvious what criterion to use for expected problems. Second, it will typically be impossible to design a provably boundedly optimal agent even given a set of expected problems, because the agent design problem itself is intractable. These problems become particularly important when agents must learn from their environments. In order to deal with these questions, we may need to abandon the formalism of mathematics and instead look towards the process of science and engineering. I argue that it is critical to evaluate agents in terms of the expected set of problems they would face if they were deployed in the real world, either in software or in hardware, and the agent programs we use for modeling should be the best known program for any given problem subject to the broader expected set of problems the algorithm might be expected to solve–the algorithm we would choose to use if we had to hand over control of our own behavior in that domain to an artificial agent.",14
The role of common and private signals in two-sided matching with interviews,"Sanmay Das, Zhuoshu Li",2014,"Conference Web and Internet Economics: 10th International Conference, WINE 2014, Beijing, China, December 14-17, 2014. Proceedings 10","We study two-sided matching markets where the matching is preceded by a costly interviewing stage in which firms acquire information about the qualities of candidates. Our focus is on the impact of the signals of quality available prior to the interviewing stage. Using a mixture of simulation, numerical, and empirical game theoretic analysis, we show that more commonality in the quality signals can be harmful, yielding fewer matches as some firms make the same mistakes in choosing whom to interview. Relatively high and medium quality candidates are most likely to suffer lower match probabilities. The effect can be mitigated when firms use “more rational” interviewing strategies, or through the availability of private signals of candidate quality to the firms.",13
Homelessness service provision: a data science perspective,"Yuan Gao, Sanmay Das, Patrick Fowler",2017/3/21,Conference Workshops at the thirty-first AAAI conference on artificial intelligence,"We study homeless service provision in the United States from a data science perspective, with the goal of informing homelessness prevention efforts. We use machine learning techniques to predict household reentry into a homeless system using an administrative dataset containing both demographic and service information. This data recorded all publicly funded services provided in a Midwestern US community from 2007 through 2014. We find that several techniques can provide useful lift in the prediction task, with random forests achieving an AUC around 0.7. Prediction improves significantly when conducted within calendar years, compared to across years, suggesting that changing dynamics drive repeated need for homeless services. We also analyze key service usage patterns that are associated with lower probabilities for reentry. Counterintuitively, individuals receiving the least intensive services provided through the homelessness system exhibit significantly lower likelihoods for further system involvement compared to individuals who received more intensive services, even after accounting for initial differences through propensity score and nearest neighbor matching. These result provide intriguing insights into homelessness service delivery that need to be further probed. In particular, it is unclear whether these less intensive services sustainably address housing needs, or whether, in contrast, frustration with inadequate services drives clients away from the homelessness system. Our results provide a proof-of-concept for how data science approaches can drive interesting, socially important research in the provision of public services.",12
Competing dynamic matching markets,"Sanmay Das, John P Dickerson, Zhuoshu Li, Tuomas Sandholm",2015/8/13,"Journal Proceedings of the Conference on Auctions, Market Mechanisms and Their Applications (AMMA)","While dynamic matching markets are usually modeled in isolation, assuming that every agent to be matched enters that market, in many real-world settings there exist rival matching markets with overlapping pools of agents. We extend a framework of dynamic matching due to Akbarpour et al.[2] to characterize outcomes in cases where two such rival matching markets compete with each other. One market matches quickly while the other builds market thickness by matching slowly. We give an analytic bound on the loss—the expected fraction of unmatched vertices—of this two-market environment relative to one in which all agents enter either one market or the other, and numerically quantify its exact loss, demonstrating that rival markets increase overall loss compared to a single market that builds thickness. We then look at two competing kidney exchanges, where patients with end-stage renal failure swap willing but incompatible donors, and show that matching with rival barter exchanges performs qualitatively the same as matching with rival matching markets—that is, rival markets increase global loss.",12

It enables principled study of such issues as manipulation, trustworthiness of information, and potential bias. We demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in determining point of view on both synthetic data and a dataset of Wikipedia user interactions.

Competitive information provision in sequential search markets,"Meenal Chhabra, Sanmay Das, David Sarne",2014/5/5,Book Proceedings of the 2014 international conference on Autonomous agents and multi-agent systems,"We study competitive information provision in search markets. Consider the used car market: as a consumer searches, she receives noisy signals of the values of cars. She can consult an expert (say Carfax or a mechanic) to find out more about the true value before deciding whether to purchase a particular car or keep searching. Prior research has studied the pricing problem faced by a monopolistic expert who provides searchers with perfect information. Here, we study a richer model that augments prior work in two important respects. First, we analyze expert duopolies; thus each expert must now reason about the influence of her strategy on the other. Second, we consider experts who provide uncertain information, with higher quality experts providing more certainty; experts can compete on both price and quality. We show that, in equilibrium, prices will be set such that the searcher consults the worse quality expert for low or high signals, and the higher quality expert for intermediate signals. Surprisingly, we find cases where an improvement in the quality of the higher-quality expert (holding everything else constant) can be pareto-improving: not only does that expert’s profit increase, so does the other expert’s profit and the searcher’s utility.",11
Revenue Enhancement Via Asymmetric Signaling in Interdependent-Value Auctions,"Zhuoshu Li, Sanmay Das",2019,Journal AAAI 2019,"We consider the problem of designing the information environment for revenue maximization in a sealed-bid second price auction with two bidders. Much of the prior literature has focused on signal design in settings where bidders are symmetrically informed, or on the design of optimal mechanisms under fixed information structures. We study commonand interdependent-value settings where the mechanism is fixed (a second-price auction), but the auctioneer controls the signal structure for bidders. We show that in a standard common-value auction setting, there is no benefit to the auctioneer in terms of expected revenue from sharing information with the bidders, although there are effects on the distribution of revenues. In an interdependent-value model with mixed private-and common-value components, however, we show that asymmetric, information-revealing signals can increase revenue.",9
Trade-offs between group fairness metrics in societal resource allocation,"Tasfia Mashiat, Xavier Gitiaux, Huzefa Rangwala, Patrick Fowler, Sanmay Das",2022/6/21,"Book 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency"," We consider social resource allocations that deliver an array of scarce supports to a diverse population. Such allocations pervade social service delivery, such as provision of homeless services and assignment of refugees to cities, among others. At issue is whether allocations are fair across sociodemographic groups and intersectional identities. Our paper shows that necessary trade-offs exist for fairness in the context of scarcity; many reasonable definitions of equitable outcomes cannot hold simultaneously except under stringent conditions. For example, defining fairness in terms of improvement over a baseline inherently conflicts with defining fairness in terms of loss compared with the best possible outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate that the fairness trade-offs stem from heterogeneity across groups in intervention responses.

Near-optimal target learning with stochastic binary signals,"Mithun Chakraborty, Sanmay Das, Malik Magdon-Ismail",2012/2/14,Journal UAI 2011,"We study learning in a noisy bisection model: specifically, Bayesian algorithms to learn a target value V given access only to noisy realizations of whether V is less than or greater than a threshold theta. At step t = 0, 1, 2, ..., the learner sets threshold theta t and observes a noisy realization of sign(V - theta t). After T steps, the goal is to output an estimate V^ which is within an eta-tolerance of V . This problem has been studied, predominantly in environments with a fixed error probability q < 1/2 for the noisy realization of sign(V - theta t). In practice, it is often the case that q can approach 1/2, especially as theta -> V, and there is little known when this happens. We give a pseudo-Bayesian algorithm which provably converges to V. When the true prior matches our algorithm's Gaussian prior, we show near-optimal expected performance. Our methods extend to the general multiple-threshold setting where the observation noisily indicates which of k >= 2 regions V belongs to.",7
An agent-based model of dealership markets,Sanmay Das,2003/10,"Journal Proceedings of the International Workshop on Complex Agent-based Dynamic Networks, Oxford","This paper describes an agent-based model of financial markets with monopolistic or competitive market-makers and analyzes some of the emergent properties of these markets, including time series properties. The artificial markets we discuss utilize models of “informed” trading agents who decide to trade based on received signals of the true or fundamental value of the stock, and “uninformed” trading agents (sometimes called liquidity traders) who trade for exogenous reasons and are modeled as buying and selling stock randomly. These simple models of traders, combined with more complex market-making agents who function as price-setters and inventory-holders in the market, lead to a rich array of market properties, many of which qualitatively replicate properties observed in real financial markets. For example, the bid-ask spread increases in response to uncertainty about the true value of a stock, average spreads tend to be higher in more volatile markets, and market-makers with lower average spreads perform better in competitive environments. The time series data generated by our market models demonstrate phenomena like volatility clustering and the fat-tailed nature of return distributions, without the need to specify explicit models for opinion propagation and herd behavior in the trading crowd. Our models of trading are simpler than most models in the literature that succeed in demonstrating such properties.",7
Scarce societal resource allocation and the price of (local) justice,"Quan Nguyen, Sanmay Das, Roman Garnett",2021/5/18,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"We consider the allocation of scarce societal resources, where a central authority decides which individuals receive which resources under capacity or budget constraints. Several algorithmic fairness criteria have been proposed to guide these procedures, each quantifying a notion of local justice to ensure the allocation is aligned with the principles of the local institution making the allocation. For example, the efficient allocation maximizes overall social welfare, whereas the leximin assignment seeks to help the “neediest first.” Although the “price of fairness”(PoF) of leximin has been studied in prior work, we expand on these results by exploiting the structure inherent in real-world scenarios to provide tighter bounds. We further propose a novel criterion–which we term LoINC (leximin over individually normalized costs)–that maximizes a different but commonly used notion of local justice: prioritizing those benefiting the most from receiving the resources. We derive analogous PoF bounds for LoINC, showing that the price of LoINC is typically much lower than that of leximin. We provide extensive experimental results using both synthetic data and in a real-world setting considering the efficacy of different homelessness interventions. These results show that the empirical PoF tends to be substantially lower than worst-case bounds would imply and allow us to characterize situations where the price of LoINC fairness can be high.",6
Market scoring rules act as opinion pools for risk-averse agents,"Mithun Chakraborty, Sanmay Das",2015,Journal Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,"A market scoring rule (MSR)–a popular tool for designing algorithmic prediction markets–is an incentive-compatible mechanism for the aggregation of probabilistic beliefs from myopic risk-neutral agents. In this paper, we add to a growing body of research aimed at understanding the precise manner in which the price process induced by a MSR incorporates private information from agents who deviate from the assumption of risk-neutrality. We first establish that, for a myopic trading agent with a risk-averse utility function, a MSR satisfying mild regularity conditions elicits the agent’s risk-neutral probability conditional on the latest market state rather than her true subjective probability. Hence, we show that a MSR under these conditions effectively behaves like a more traditional method of belief aggregation, namely an opinion pool, for agents’ true probabilities. In particular, the logarithmic market scoring rule acts as a logarithmic pool for constant absolute risk aversion utility agents, and as a linear pool for an atypical budget-constrained agent utility with decreasing absolute risk aversion. We also point out the interpretation of a market maker under these conditions as a Bayesian learner even when agent beliefs are static.",6
Unfairness despite awareness: Group-fair classification with strategic agents,"Andrew Estornell, Sanmay Das, Yang Liu, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik",2021/12/6,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.02746,"The use of algorithmic decision making systems in domains which impact the financial, social, and political well-being of people has created a demand for these decision making systems to be ""fair"" under some accepted notion of equity. This demand has in turn inspired a large body of work focused on the development of fair learning algorithms which are then used in lieu of their conventional counterparts. Most analysis of such fair algorithms proceeds from the assumption that the people affected by the algorithmic decisions are represented as immutable feature vectors. However, strategic agents may possess both the ability and the incentive to manipulate this observed feature vector in order to attain a more favorable outcome. We explore the impact that strategic agent behavior could have on fair classifiers and derive conditions under which this behavior leads to fair classifiers becoming less fair than their conventional counterparts under the same measure of fairness that the fair classifier takes into account. These conditions are related to the the way in which the fair classifier remedies unfairness on the original unmanipulated data: fair classifiers which remedy unfairness by becoming more selective than their conventional counterparts are the ones that become less fair than their counterparts when agents are strategic. We further demonstrate that both the increased selectiveness of the fair classifier, and consequently the loss of fairness, arises when performing fair learning on domains in which the advantaged group is overrepresented in the region near (and on the beneficial side of) the decision boundary of conventional classifiers.

Local Justice and the Algorithmic Allocation of Scarce Societal Resources,Sanmay Das,2022/6/28,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"AI is increasingly used to aid decision-making about the allocation of scarce societal resources, for example housing for homeless people, organs for transplantation, and food donations.

This paper lays out possible roles and opportunities for AI in this domain, arguing for a closer engagement with the political philosophy literature on local justice, which provides a framework for thinking about how societies have over time framed objectives for such allocation problems. It also discusses how we may be able to integrate into this framework the opportunities and risks opened up by the ubiquity of data and the availability of algorithms that can use them to make accurate predictions about the future.",4
Deception through half-truths,"Andrew Estornell, Sanmay Das, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik",2020/4/3,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"Deception is a fundamental issue across a diverse array of settings, from cybersecurity, where decoys (eg, honeypots) are an important tool, to politics that can feature politically motivated “leaks” and fake news about candidates. Typical considerations of deception view it as providing false information. However, just as important but less frequently studied is a more tacit form where information is strategically hidden or leaked. We consider the problem of how much an adversary can affect a principal's decision by “half-truths”, that is, by masking or hiding bits of information, when the principal is oblivious to the presence of the adversary. The principal's problem can be modeled as one of predicting future states of variables in a dynamic Bayes network, and we show that, while theoretically the principal's decisions can be made arbitrarily bad, the optimal attack is NP-hard to approximate, even under strong assumptions favoring the attacker. However, we also describe an important special case where the dependency of future states on past states is additive, in which we can efficiently compute an approximately optimal attack. Moreover, in networks with a linear transition function we can solve the problem optimally in polynomial time.",4
Equilibrium Behavior in Competing Dynamic Matching Markets.,"Zhuoshu Li, Neal Gupta, Sanmay Das, John P Dickerson",2018/7/13,Conference IJCAI,"Rival markets like rideshare services, universities, and organ exchanges compete to attract participants, seeking to maximize their own utility at potential cost to overall social welfare. Similarly, individual participants in such multi-market systems also seek to maximize their individual utility. If entry is costly, they should strategically enter only a subset of the available markets. All of this decision making—markets competitively adapting their matching strategies and participants arriving, choosing which market (s) to enter, and departing from the system—occurs dynamically over time. This paper provides the first analysis of equilibrium behavior in dynamic competing matching market systems—first from the points of view of individual participants when market policies are fixed, and then from the points of view of markets when agents are stochastic. When compared to single markets running social-welfare-maximizing matching policies, losses in overall social welfare in competitive systems manifest due to both market fragmentation and the use of non-optimal matching policies. We quantify such losses and provide policy recommendations to help alleviate them in fielded systems.",4

Predictive State Representations (PSRs) allow one to build explicit, low-level models of the expected outcomes of actions, and are therefore well-suited for tasks that require providing such evidence of understanding. Using human-robot shadow puppetry as a prototype interaction study, we show that PSRs can be used successfully to both model human interactions, and to allow a robot to learn on-line how to engage a human in an interesting interaction.",4

Incentivizing Truthfulness Through Audits in Strategic Classification,"Andrew Estornell, Sanmay Das, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik",2021/5/18,Journal Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"In many societal resource allocation domains, machine learning methods are increasingly used to either score or rank agents in order to decide which ones should receive either resources (eg, homeless services) or scrutiny (eg, child welfare investigations) from social services agencies. An agency's scoring function typically operates on a feature vector that contains a combination of self-reported features and information available to the agency about individuals or households. This can create incentives for agents to misrepresent their self-reported features in order to receive resources or avoid scrutiny, but agencies may be able to selectively audit agents to verify the veracity of their reports. We study the problem of optimal auditing of agents in such settings. When decisions are made using a threshold on an agent's score, the optimal audit policy has a surprisingly simple structure, uniformly auditing all agents who could benefit from lying. While this policy can, in general be hard to compute because of the difficulty of identifying the set of agents who could benefit from lying given a complete set of reported types, we also present sufficient conditions under which it is tractable. We show that the scarce resource setting is more difficult, and exhibit an approximately optimal audit policy in this case. In addition, we show that in either setting verifying whether it is possible to incentivize exact truthfulness is hard even to approximate. However, we also exhibit sufficient conditions for solving this problem optimally, and for obtaining good approximations.",2
Efficient nonmyopic online allocation of scarce reusable resources,"Zehao Dong, Sanmay Das, Patrick Fowler, Chien-Ju Ho",2021/1,Journal AAMAS Conference proceedings,"We study settings where a set of identical, reusable resources must be allocated in an online fashion to arriving agents. Each arriving agent is patient and willing to wait for some period of time to be matched. When matched, each agent occupies a resource for a certain amount of time, and then releases it, gaining some utility from having done so. The goal of the system designer is to maximize overall utility given some prior knowledge of the distribution of arriving agents. We are particularly interested in settings where demand for the resources far outstrips supply, as is typical in the provision of social services, for example homelessness resources. We formulate this problem as online bipartite matching with reusable resources and patient agents. We develop new, efficient nonmyopic algorithms for this class of problems, and compare their performance with that of greedy algorithms in a variety of simulated settings, as well as in a setting calibrated to real-world data on household demand for homelessness services. We find substantial overall welfare benefits to using our nonmyopic algorithms, particularly in more extreme settings – those where agents are unwilling or unable to wait for resources, and where the ratio of resource demand to supply is particularly high.",2
Election control by manipulating issue significance,"Andrew Estornell, Sanmay Das, Edith Elkind, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik",2020/8/27,Conference Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence,"Integrity of elections is vital to democratic systems, but it is frequently threatened by malicious actors. The study of algorithmic complexity of the problem of manipulating election outcomes by changing its structural features is known as election control Rothe [2016]. One means of election control that has been proposed, pertinent to the spatial voting model, is to select a subset of issues that determine voter preferences over candidates. We study a variation of this model in which voters have judgments about relative importance of issues, and a malicious actor can manipulate these judgments. We show that computing effective manipulations in this model is NP-hard even with two candidates or binary issues. However, we demonstrate that the problem becomes tractable with a constant number of voters or issues. Additionally, while it remains intractable when voters can vote stochastically, we exhibit an important special case in which stochastic voting behavior enables tractable manipulation.",2

By leveraging  the Twitter accounts of U.S. House of Representatives members, we develop a new understanding of House leadership power using natural language processing methods in new ways.  Formal theoretic work on congressional leadership suggests a tension in legislative party members' policy stances as they balance coordination and information problems.  When their coordination problem is more pressing, the model predicts that legislative members will follow their party leaders' policy positions.  When the information problem is more acute, party members coordinate and give their leaders direction for the party's agenda.  Specifically, we exploit the network structure of retweets to derive measures of House leadership centrality within each party. We also use Joint Sentiment Topic modeling to quantify the discussion space for House members on Twitter.

Fair and Efficient Allocation of Scarce Resources Based on Predicted Outcomes: Implications for Homeless Service Delivery,"Amanda R Kube, Sanmay Das, Patrick J Fowler",2019/11/22,"Description Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and algorithmic techniques in general, provide two crucial abilities with the potential to improve decision-making in the context of allocation of scarce societal resources. They have the ability to flexibly and accurately model treatment response at the individual level, potentially allowing us to better match available resources to individuals. In addition, they have the ability to reason simultaneously about the effects of matching sets of scarce resources to populations of individuals. In this work, we leverage these abilities to study algorithmic allocation of scarce societal resources in the context of homelessness. In communities throughout the United States, there is constant demand for an array of homeless services intended to address different levels of need. Allocations of housing services must match households to appropriate services that continuously fluctuate in availability, while inefficiencies in allocation could “waste” scarce resources as households will remain needy and reenter the homeless system, increasing the overall demand for homeless services. This complex allocation problem introduces novel technical and ethical challenges. Using administrative data from a regional homeless system, we formulate the problem of “optimal” allocation of resources given data on households with need for homeless services. The optimization problem aims to allocate available resources such that predicted probabilities of household reentry are minimized.

Faster Policy Adaptation in Environments with Exogeneity: A State Augmentation Approach.,"Zhuoshu Li, Zhitang Chen, Pascal Poupart, Sanmay Das, Yanhui Geng",2018/7/9,Conference AAMAS,"In Reinforcement Learning (RL), the environmental dynamics are often assumed to be fixed (ie, the transition function does not evolve with time). When this assumption is violated, as it often is in practice, learning becomes challenging; past transitions stop being representative of current and future transitions, and RL methods therefore need to relearn the policy. While an agent is relearning its policy, performance is negatively affected. In this paper, we develop a new RL algorithm for environments where the evolution of the state transition is caused by a continuous latent exogenous variable that varies with time, where the evolution of the variable itself is not affected by the action. Our algorithm (1) tracks in an online fashion and recovers the latent",1

Learning to trade with insider information,Sanmay Das,2007/8/19,Book Proceedings of the ninth international conference on Electronic commerce,"This paper introduces algorithms for learning how to trade using insider (superior) information in Kyle's model of financial markets. Prior results in finance theory relied on the insider having perfect knowledge of the structure and parameters of the market. I show here that it is possible to learn the equilibrium trading strategy when its form is known even without knowledge of the parameters governing trading in the model. However, the rate of convergence to equilibrium is slow, and an approximate algorithm that does not converge to the equilibrium strategy achieves better utility when the horizon is limited. I analyze this approximate algorithm from the perspective of reinforcement learning and discuss the importance of domain knowledge in designing a successful learning algorithm.",1

Converging to Stability in Two-Sided Bandits: The Case of Unknown Preferences on Both Sides of a Matching Market,"Gaurab Pokharel, Sanmay Das",2023/2/13,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.06176,"We study the problem of repeated two-sided matching with uncertain preferences (two-sided bandits), and no explicit communication between agents. Recent work has developed algorithms that converge to stable matchings when one side (the proposers or agents) must learn their preferences, but the preferences of the other side (the proposees or arms) are common knowledge, and the matching mechanism uses simultaneous proposals at each round. We develop new algorithms that converge to stable matchings for two more challenging settings: one where the arm preferences are no longer common knowledge, and a second, more general one where the arms are also uncertain about their own preferences. In our algorithms, agents start with optimistic beliefs about arms' preferences, updating these preferences over time, and combining beliefs about preferences with beliefs about the value of matching when choosing whom to propose to.",
GenSyn: A Multi-stage Framework for Generating Synthetic Microdata using Macro Data Sources,"Angeela Acharya, Siddhartha Sikdar, Sanmay Das, Huzefa Rangwala",2022/12/8,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.05975,"Individual-level data (microdata) that characterizes a population, is essential for studying many real-world problems. However, acquiring such data is not straightforward due to cost and privacy constraints, and access is often limited to aggregated data (macro data) sources. In this study, we examine synthetic data generation as a tool to extrapolate difficult-to-obtain high-resolution data by combining information from multiple easier-to-obtain lower-resolution data sources. In particular, we introduce a framework that uses a combination of univariate and multivariate frequency tables from a given target geographical location in combination with frequency tables from other auxiliary locations to generate synthetic microdata for individuals in the target location. Our method combines the estimation of a dependency graph and conditional probabilities from the target location with the use of a Gaussian copula to leverage the available information from the auxiliary locations. We perform extensive testing on two real-world datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior approaches in preserving the overall dependency structure of the data while also satisfying the constraints defined on the different variables.",

The Promise and Perils of Myopia in Dynamic Pricing With Censored Information.,"Meenal Chhabra, Sanmay Das, Ilya O Ryzhov",2018,Conference IJCAI,"A seller with unlimited inventory of a digital good interacts with potential buyers with iid valuations. The seller can adaptively quote prices to each buyer to maximize long-term profits, but does not know the valuation distribution exactly. Under a linear demand model, we consider two information settings: partially censored, where agents who buy reveal their true valuations after the purchase is completed, and completely censored, where agents never reveal their valuations. In the partially censored case, we prove that myopic pricing with a Pareto prior is Bayes optimal and has finite regret. In both settings, we evaluate the myopic strategy against more sophisticated look-aheads using three valuation distributions generated from real data on auctions of physical goods, keyword auctions, and user ratings, where the linear demand assumption is clearly violated. For some datasets, complete censoring actually helps, because the restricted data acts as a “regularizer” on the posterior, preventing it from being affected too much by outliers.",

A Symbolic Closed-Form Solution to Sequential Market Making with Inventory.,"Shamin Kinathil, Scott Sanner, Sanmay Das, Nicolás Della Penna",2016/7/9,Conference IJCAI,"Market-makers serve an important role as providers of liquidity and order in financial markets, particularly during periods of high volatility. Optimal market-makers solve a sequential decision making problem, where they face an exploration versus exploitation dilemma at each time step. A belief state MDP based solution was presented by Das and Magdon-Ismail [2008]. This solution however, was closely tied to the choice of a Gaussian belief state prior and did not take asset inventory into consideration when calculating an optimal policy. In this work we introduce a novel continuous state POMDP framework which is the first to solve, exactly and in closed-form, the optimal market-making problem with inventory, fixed asset value, arbitrary belief state priors, trader models and reward functions via symbolic dynamic programming. We use this novel model and solution to show that sequentially optimal policies are heavily inventory-dependent and calculate policies that operate with bounded loss guarantees under a variety of market models and conditions.",

Do experts help in two-sided search?,"Yinon Nahum, David Sarne, Onn Shehory, Sanmay Das",2012/6/4,Conference AAMAS,"We study agents matching to form teams in a distributed multi-agent environment. Each agent receives information about the potential value of teaming with others. This information signal may be noisy. If all candidate agents agree to the matching the team is formed and each agent receives the true unknown utility of the matching, and leaves the market. We consider the effect of the presence of information brokers, or experts, on the outcomes of such matching processes. Experts can, upon payment of a fee, perform the service of finding and revealing the true value of a match to any agent. We analyze the equilibrium formed in the two-sided search setting, given the fee set by a monopolist expert. We then derive the revenue maximizing strategy for the expert as the first mover in a Stackelberg game. We find that better information can hurt: the presence of the expert, even if the use of its services is optional, can degrade individual agents’ utilities and overall social welfare. While in one-sided search the presence of the expert can only help, in two-sided search the externality imposed by the fact that others are consulting the expert can lead to a situation where the equilibrium outcome is that everyone consults the expert, even though all agents would be better off if the expert were not present. As an antidote, we show how market designers can enhance welfare by subsidizing the expert to make her services more expensive, instead of providing conventional subsidies which reduce consumer costs.",

Next, we describe a set of rules that can be used to further filter out proteins that are not novel, or not well characterized. Using both these pipeline stages, a human expert only has to examine about 2% of Swiss-Prot records for potential inclusion in","Scholar articles A Pipeline to Automate the Updating of a Specialized Protein DatabaseS Das, MH Saier Jr, C ElkanRelated articles ","Motivation: The growing number of specialized databases in molecular biology, coupled with the huge increase in the availability of molecular data, necessitates the development of automatic methods for finding and adding relevant information to these databases.

Bundling in Expert Mediated Search,"Meenal Chhabra, Sanmay Das, David Sarne",Agent-Mediated Electronic Commerce,Pages 29,"In search-based markets with noisy signals, like the market for used cars, experts can play an important role. These experts act as information brokers, revealing the true value of a good in exchange for the payment of a fee. Sometimes these experts may choose to sell only bundles of their services (three car inspections for a fixed price, eg). We analyze bundling of services in a model of expert-mediated (one-sided) search, and derive optimal strategies for experts and buyers. Our analysis reveals some surprising results. In particular, there are situations where offering only non-unit-size bundles of services can be pareto-improving for the expert and the buyer. Further, in markets with low search costs, the optimal strategy for the expert may well be to offer unlimited services for a single flat fee.",
"ASEEM BRAHMA, Qualcomm Inc.","MITHUN CHAKRABORTY, SANMAY DAS, ALLEN LAVOIE, MALIK MAGDON-ISMAIL","Ensuring sufficient liquidity is one of the key challenges for designers of prediction markets. Variants of the logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR) have emerged as the standard. LMSR market makers are loss-making in general and need to be subsidized. Proposed variants, including liquidity sensitive market makers, suffer from an inability to react rapidly to jumps in population beliefs. In this paper we propose a Bayesian Market Maker for binary outcome (or continuous 0-1) markets that learns from the informational content of trades. By sacrificing the guarantee of bounded loss, the Bayesian Market Maker can simultaneously offer:(1) significantly lower expected loss at the same level of liquidity, and,(2) rapid convergence when there is a jump in the underlying true value of the security. We present extensive evaluations of the algorithm in experiments with intelligent trading agents and in human subject experiments. Our investigation also elucidates some general properties of market makers in prediction markets. In particular, there is an inherent tradeoff between adaptability to market shocks and convergence during market equilibrium.","Scholar articles ASEEM BRAHMA, Qualcomm Inc.M CHAKRABORTY, S DAS, A LAVOIE…Related articles All 3 versions ","Ensuring sufficient liquidity is one of the key challenges for designers of prediction markets.

Artificial Financial Markets with Adaptive Trading Agents,"Adlar Jeewook Kim, Sanmay Das, Tomaso Poggio, Andrew Lo",Bid,Volume 1,"Motivation: In the last decade there has been a surge of interest within the finance community in describing equity markets through computational agent models [5]. At the same time, financial markets are an important application area within artificial intelligence for the fields of agent-based modeling and machine learning, since agent objectives and interactions tend to be more clearly defined, both practically and mathematically, in these markets than in other areas. Computational modeling of markets allows for the opportunity to push beyond the restrictions of traditional theoretical models of markets through the use of computational power. At the same time, the artificial markets approach allows a fine-grained level of experimental control that is not available in real markets. Thus, data obtained from artificial market experiments can be compared to the predictions of theoretical models and to data from real-world markets, and the level of control allows one to examine precisely which settings and conditions lead to the deviations from theoretical predictions usually seen in the behavior of real markets. This project is also an application area for the general problems of distributed intelligence such as collective learning, coordination and competition. We are interested in studying how software agents endowed with learning abilities might interact, co-evolve, and cooperate in societies of learning agents.",
Two-sided Bandit Problems,Sanmay Das,"What: We are studying the learning problem faced by agents in repeated matching environments, which we call the two-sided bandit problem. Standard bandit problems [1, 5, inter alia] typify the exploration-exploitation dilemma. In an n-armed bandit problem, an agent must choose which of n arms to pull at each time period to maximize long-term expected reward, while simultaneously trying to estimate the reward distribution for each arm. The agent must decide between pulling the arm with the highest expected value and pulling an arm in order to learn more about its reward distribution (even though it might have a lower expected value in this period). We generalize this to the two-sided problem, in which the arms themselves have agency. An arm gets a reward based on who pulls it, and it can reject a particular puller. This problem is related to both the literature on learning in games [3] and on two-sided search with nontransferable utility [2]. We are exploring the impact of different matching mechanisms (protocols for pairing pullers and arms) and learning algorithms.Why: Two-sided bandit problems are a natural formulation of markets in which agents of two different types match up repeatedly. Examples of such markets are the dating market, in which men and women repeatedly go out on dates while learning about the quality of those they date, and the labor market, in which firms and workers learn about each other during the course of employment. A simple twosided bandit model may not be able to capture all aspects of these markets, like utility transfers between matched agents and contracts like marriage, but it provides a useful starting …",Scholar articles Two-sided Bandit ProblemsS DasRelated articles ,"What: We are studying the learning problem faced by agents in repeated matching environments, which we call the two-sided bandit problem.

Two-Sided Bandit Problems and Matching Markets,Sanmay Das,"We are studying the learning and decision problems of agents in matching models. Das and Kamenica have defined a class of problems in multi-agent learning and decision-making called two-sided bandit problems [1]. This class of problems is intended to capture the essence of two-sided matching scenarios in which agents must learn their preferences through experience, rather than knowing them a priori. Two-sided bandit models can be applied to a wide range of markets in which two different types of agents must match with each other. Consider a repeated game in which agents gain an uncertain payoff from being matched with a particular agent on the other side of the market in each time period. A natural example of such a situation is the dating market, in which men and women repeatedly go out on dates and learn about each other. Another example is a spot labor market, in which employers and employees are matched for particular job contracts. A matching mechanism is used to pair the agents. For example, we can consider a mechanism in which all the women decide which man to"" ask out,"" and then each man selects a woman from his set of offers, with the rejected women left unmatched for that period.
