Handbook of design and analysis of experiments,"Angela M Dean, Max Morris, John Stufken, Derek Bingham",2015/6/26,Volume 7,"Experiments are run for many purposes and are prevalent in a wide range of application areas. Examples of experimental contexts include engineering for the design and improvement of complex systems, pharmaceutical industry efforts to discover and develop new drugs, and the improvement of crop yield and sustainability in agriculture. Recent improvements in computer speed and memory have led to important developments in the computational aspects of the statistical challenges associated with the various components of experimentation. This handbook provides a description of many of the recent advances in the field, as well as a detailed, comprehensive overview of the basic tools required for the optimal design of experiments and their analyses.

Information-based optimal subdata selection for big data linear regression,"HaiYing Wang, Min Yang, John Stufken",2019/1/2,Journal Journal of the American Statistical Association,"Extraordinary amounts of data are being produced in many branches of science. Proven statistical methods are no longer applicable with extraordinary large datasets due to computational limitations. A critical step in big data analysis is data reduction. Existing investigations in the context of linear regression focus on subsampling-based methods. However, not only is this approach prone to sampling errors, it also leads to a covariance matrix of the estimators that is typically bounded from below by a term that is of the order of the inverse of the subdata size. We propose a novel approach, termed information-based optimal subdata selection (IBOSS). Compared to leading existing subdata methods, the IBOSS approach has the following advantages: (i) it is significantly faster; (ii) it is suitable for distributed parallel computing; (iii) the variances of the slope parameter estimators converge to 0 as the full data size …",151
Sampling plans excluding contiguous units,"AS Hedayat, CR Rao, J Stufken",1988/1/1,Journal Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference,We consider fixed size sampling plans for which the second order inclusion probabilities are zero for pairs of contiguous units and constant for pairs of non-contiguous units. A practical motivation for the use of such plans is pointed out and a statistical condition is identified under which these plans are more efficient than the corresponding simple random sampling plans. Results on the existence and construction of these plans are obtained.,110
Multi-objective optimal experimental designs for event-related fMRI studies,"Ming-Hung Kao, Abhyuday Mandal, Nicole Lazar, John Stufken",2009/2/1,Journal NeuroImage,"In this article, we propose an efficient approach to find optimal experimental designs for event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (ER-fMRI). We consider multiple objectives, including estimating the hemodynamic response function (HRF), detecting activation, circumventing psychological confounds and fulfilling customized requirements. Taking into account these goals, we formulate a family of multi-objective design criteria and develop a genetic-algorithm-based technique to search for optimal designs. Our proposed technique incorporates existing knowledge about the performance of fMRI designs, and its usefulness is shown through simulations. Although our approach also works for other linear combinations of parameters, we primarily focus on the case when the interest lies either in the individual stimulus effects or in pairwise contrasts between stimulus types.

Support points of locally optimal designs for nonlinear models with two parameters,"Min Yang, John Stufken",2009/2/1,Journal The Annals of Statistics,"We propose a new approach for identifying the support points of a locally optimal design when the model is a nonlinear model. In contrast to the commonly used geometric approach, we use an approach based on algebraic tools. Considerations are restricted to models with two parameters, and the general results are applied to often used special cases, including logistic, probit, double exponential and double reciprocal models for binary data, a loglinear Poisson regression model for count data, and the Michaelis-Menten model. The approach, which is also of value for multi-stage experiments, works both with constrained and unconstrained design regions and is relatively easy to implement.",102
3 Optimal crossover designs,John Stufken,1996/1/1,Source Handbook of statistics,"This chapter focuses on optimal crossover designs. The principal idea associated with crossover designs is to use a number of available units for several measurements at different occasions. One possible motive for using a crossover design is that a crossover design requires fewer subjects for the same number of observations. This can obviously be an important consideration when subjects are scarce and when including a large number of subjects in the experiment can be prohibitively expensive. Another possible motive for using crossover designs is that these designs provide within subject information about treatment differences. In many applications, the different subjects would exhibit large natural differences, and inferences concerning treatment comparisons based on between subject information—available if subject effects are assumed to be random effects—would require a much …",88

Optimal crossover designs in a model with self and mixed carryover effects,"Joachim Kunert, J Stufken",2002/9/1,Journal Journal of the American Statistical Association,"We consider a variant of the usual model for crossover designs with carryover effects. Instead of assuming that the carryover effect of a treatment is the same regardless of the treatment in the next period, the model assumes that the carryover effect of a treatment on itself is different from the carryover effect on other treatments. For the traditional model, optimal designs tend to have pairs of consecutive identical treatments; for the model considered here, they tend to avoid such pairs. Practitioners have long expressed reservations about designs that exhibit such pairs and about the traditional model. The new model provides an attractive alternative that leads to appealing optimal designs.",69

Identifying locally optimal designs for nonlinear models: A simple extension with profound consequences,"Min Yang, John Stufken",2012/6/1,Volume 40," We extend the approach in [Ann. Statist. 38 (2010) 2499–2524] for identifying locally optimal designs for nonlinear models. Conceptually the extension is relatively simple, but the consequences in terms of applications are profound. As we will demonstrate, we can obtain results for locally optimal designs under many optimality criteria and for a larger class of models than has been done hitherto. In many cases the results lead to optimal designs with the minimal number of support points. ",60
24 Designs in survey sampling avoiding contiguous units,"AS Hedayat, CR Rao, J Stufken",1988/1/1,Source Handbook of statistics,"Various ideas to obtain improved estimates of population characteristics in the presence of some additional knowledge on the sampling units are available in the literature. In this chapter we discuss one of such ideas, recently introduced in a paper by Hedayat, Rao and Stufken (1988). It applies if there exists some ordering of the units under which contiguous units are anticipated to provide similar data. In such a situation, it is intuitively appealing that more information on the population can be obtained if the sample avoids pairs of contiguous units. The required ordering of the units will in most such situations be induced by a natural entity, such as time, location, and so on. It may be an ordering in one or more dimensions. As an example, small neighboring plots at a dump site for chemical waste tend to give similar measurements on the present amount of some chemical compound. With the plots as the sampling …",59
Complete enumeration of two-Level orthogonal arrays of strength d with d + 2 constraints,"John Stufken, Boxin Tang",2007/4/1,Volume 35," Enumerating nonisomorphic orthogonal arrays is an important, yet very difficult, problem. Although orthogonal arrays with a specified set of parameters have been enumerated in a number of cases, general results are extremely rare. In this paper, we provide a complete solution to enumerating nonisomorphic two-level orthogonal arrays of strength d with d+2 constraints for any d and any run size n=λ2d. Our results not only give the number of nonisomorphic orthogonal arrays for given d and n, but also provide a systematic way of explicitly constructing these arrays. Our approach to the problem is to make use of the recently developed theory of J-characteristics for fractional factorial designs. Besides the general theoretical results, the paper presents some results from applications of the theory to orthogonal arrays of strength two, three and four. ",52
A linear programming bound for orthogonal arrays with mixed levels,"Neil James Alexander Sloane, John Stufken",1996/12/15,Journal Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference,We show how the Delsarte theory can be used to obtain a linear programming bound for orthogonal arrays with mixed levels.

Optimal and efficient crossover designs under different assumptions about the carryover effects,"AS Hedayat, John Stufken",2003/1/7,Journal Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics,"In certain studies it is desirable or necessary that a subject, such as a patient in a medical trial, receive a treatment in each period. This facilitates a within-subject comparison of the treatments. Designs for studies of this type are called crossover designs or repeated measurements designs. If there are ssubjects in pperiods, the design should specify which of the ttreatments is assigned to subject jin period i, i=1,…,p, j=1,…,s. Equivalently we may think of a design as assigning each subject to one of the t  p possible treatment sequences. The choice of a design will clearly depend on the values of p, s, and t, to which we will refer as the design parameters. But for any set of design parameters, we will typically still have many design choices. To distinguish between different designs for the same design parameters, we will compare the designs under criteria that are related to the objective of the study. Often the objective is …",44

Methods of searching for highly efficient designs are proposed for situations in which it is difficult to determine an A-optimal design. Under the usual additive homoscedastic model, an A-optimal design minimizes the average variance of the least squares estimators of the control-test treatment comparisons. Majumdar and Notz (1983) gave a method for finding A-optimal designs. Their optimal designs can basically be of two types, using the terminology of Hedayat and Majumdar (1984): rectangular (R), in which every block has the same number of replications of the control, and step (5), in which some blocks contain the control t times and the others t …",42

The method starts with an orthogonal array of strength 2, possibly tight, that contains mostly 2-level factors. By a computer search of this starting array, we attempt to find as large a number of 2-level factors as possible that can be used in a new orthogonal array of strength 2 containing one additional factor at more than two levels. The method produces new orthogonal arrays for some parameters, and matches the best-known arrays for others.

Optimal designs for generalized linear models,"John Stufken, Min Yang",2012/2/14,"Journal Design and Analysis of Experiments, Special Design and Applications; Hinkelmann, K., Ed","Both HK1 and HK2 deal with experiments in which the planned analysis is based on a linear model. Selecting designs for such experiments remains a critically important problem. However, there are many problems for which a linear model may not be a great choice. For example, if the response is a binary variable or a count variable rather than a continuous measurement, a linear model may be quite inappropriate. Experiments with such response variables are quite common. For example, in an experiment to compare different dosages of a drug, the outcome may be success (the dosage worked for a particular patient) or failure (it did not work). A design would consist of selecting the different dosages to be used in the experiment and the number of patients to be assigned to the selected dosages. How can one identify a good design for such a problem in which a linear model for the binary response is simply inadequate?",29

Optimal crossover designs when carryover effects are proportional to direct effects,"Mausumi Bose, John Stufken",2007/11/1,Journal Journal of statistical planning and inference,"Crossover designs are used for a variety of different applications.

A model that has recently received renewed attention in the literature is the model in which first-order carryover effects are assumed to be proportional to direct treatment effects. Under this model, assuming that the constant of proportionality is known, we identify optimal and efficient designs for the direct effects for different values of the constant of proportionality.

Assessing the impact of carryover effects on the variances of estimators of treatment differences in crossover designs,"M Ozgu Ozan, John Stufken",2010/10/30,Journal Statistics in medicine,"Different models that include carryover effects have been studied in the optimal design literature. It has been suggested that the use of these models results in increased variances of estimated contrasts of the direct treatment effects, leading to inferior estimators in terms of precision. Under a number of models and selected designs, we present variance expressions for the pairwise differences of direct treatment effects and observe that adjusting for carryover effects need not affect the precision of estimators negatively. We investigate the existence of designs that produce estimators with relatively small variances under all models considered. We conclude that even if a model is not correct, it can still be useful in increasing the precision of estimators for treatment contrasts. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",12

Optimal setting of test conditions and allocation of test units for accelerated degradation tests with two stress variables,"Guanqi Fang, Rong Pan, John Stufken",2020/6/15,Journal IEEE Transactions on Reliability,"Conducting accelerated degradation tests (ADTs) is an effective way to assess reliability of highly reliable products. In the existing literature, most works deal with planning ADT with a single stress variable; however, the situation of more than one stress variable is commonly seen in engineering practice. To fill the gap, in this article, we provide an analytical approach to address the design issue when two stress variables are present. By using a linear mixed-effects model to describe the accelerated degradation process, we demonstrate that the design problem can be solved by, first, finding the optimal setting of test conditions and allocation of test units for a “single-variable” case, and then the initial solution is transformed to the test plan for the case of two stress variables. The transformation is done by maintaining the same value of the asymptotic variance of the estimated pth quantile lifetime, along with the …",9

Locally ϕp-optimal designs for generalized linear models with a single-variable quadratic polynomial predictor,"Hsin-Ping Wu, John Stufken",2014/6/1,Journal Biometrika,"Finding optimal designs for generalized linear models is a challenging problem. Recent research has identified the structure of optimal designs for generalized linear models with single or multiple unrelated explanatory variables that appear as first-order terms in the predictor. We consider generalized linear models with a single-variable quadratic polynomial as the predictor under a popular family of optimality criteria. When the design region is unrestricted, our results establish that optimal designs can be found within a subclass of designs based on a small support with symmetric structure. We show that the same conclusion holds with certain restrictions on the design region, but in other cases a larger subclass may have to be considered. In addition, we derive explicit expressions for some D-optimal designs.",9
Constrained multiobjective designs for functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments via a modified non‐dominated sorting genetic algorithm,"Ming‐Hung Kao, Abhyuday Mandal, John Stufken",2012/8,Journal Journal of the royal statistical society: series c (applied statistics)," Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an advanced technology for studying brain functions. Owing to the complexity and high cost of functional MRI experiments, high quality multiobjective functional MRI designs are in great demand; they help to render precise statistical inference and are keys to the success of functional MRI experiments. Here, we propose an efficient approach for obtaining multiobjective functional MRI designs. In contrast with existing methods, the approach proposed does not require users to specify weights for the different objectives and can easily handle constraints to fulfil customized requirements. Moreover, the underlying statistical models that we consider are more general. We can thus obtain designs for cases where brief, long or varying stimulus durations are utilized. The usefulness of our approach is illustrated by using various experimental settings.",9

Under this model, two observations of the same treatment on the same subject are positively correlated and therefore provide less information than two observations of the same treatment on different subjects. The introduction of the interaction makes the determination of optimal designs much harder than is the case for the traditional model. Generalising the results of Bludowsky's thesis, the present paper uses Kushner's method to determine optimal approximate designs. We restrict attention to the case where the number of periods is less than or equal to the number of treatments.

Optimal designs for mixed models in experiments based on ordered units,"Dibyen Majumdar, John Stufken",2008/6/1,Volume 36," We consider experiments for comparing treatments using units that are ordered linearly over time or space within blocks. In addition to the block effect, we assume that a trend effect influences the response. The latter is modeled as a smooth component plus a random term that captures departures from the smooth trend. The model is flexible enough to cover a variety of situations; for instance, most of the effects may be either random or fixed. The information matrix for a design will be a function of several variance parameters. While data will shed light on the values of these parameters, at the design stage, they are unlikely to be known, so we suggest a maximin approach, in which a minimal information matrix is maximized. We derive maximin universally optimal designs and study their robustness. These designs are based on semibalanced arrays. Special cases correspond to results available in the literature. ",2

The most notable design selection criteria are the popular -criterion, -criterion, and more recently, the var()-criterion, while the most notable analysis technique is the Gauss-Dantzig Selector. It has been observed that while the Gauss-Dantzig Selector is often the preferred analysis technique, differences in the screening performance of different designs are not captured well by any of the common design selection criteria. In addition, none of the criteria have any direct connection to the Gauss-Dantzig Selector. We develop two new design selection criteria inspired by large sample desiderata of the Gauss-Dantzig Selector. Then, using a multi-objective Pareto-based coordinate exchange algorithm, we find Pareto efficient designs. The obtained Pareto efficient designs perform better in …",
Locally D-Optimal Designs for Binary Responses and Multiple Continuous Design Variables,"Zhongshen Wang, John Stufken",2022/9,Journal Journal of Quantitative Economics,"We identify locally D-optimal designs for binary data when a generalized linear model with multiple continuous covariates whose values can be selected at the design stage. Yang et al. (Stat Sin 21:1415–1430, 2011) provided an explicit form for D-optimal designs when there are no interaction effects between the design variables. After providing an alternative proof of that result, we generalize the result by identifying D-optimal designs for models with interactions between the design variables that satisfy the strong effect heredity principle. We also employ orthogonal arrays to obtain more practical D-optimal designs with a smaller support size.",
Factor selection in screening experiments by aggregation over random models,"Rakhi Singh, John Stufken",2022/5/26,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.13497,"Screening experiments are useful for screening out a small number of truly important factors from a large number of potentially important factors. The Gauss-Dantzig Selector (GDS) is often the preferred analysis method for screening experiments. Just considering main-effects models can result in erroneous conclusions, but including interaction terms, even if restricted to two-factor interactions, increases the number of model terms dramatically and challenges the GDS analysis. We propose a new analysis method, called Gauss-Dantzig Selector Aggregation over Random Models (GDS-ARM), which performs a GDS analysis on multiple models that include only some randomly selected interactions. Results from these different analyses are then aggregated to identify the important factors. We discuss the proposed method, suggest choices for the tuning parameters, and study its performance on real and simulated data.",
Connected Row–Column L-Designs for Symmetrical Parallel Line Assays with Two Preparations,"Feng-Shun Chai, Rakhi Singh, John Stufken",2021/12,Journal Journal of Statistical Theory and Practice,"For parallel line assays with two preparations, an L-design is an equireplicated design that accommodates the estimation of three specific contrasts of primary interest with full efficiency. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of connected L-designs for symmetrical parallel line assays with two preparations that are conducted in a row–column design.",
Efficient orthogonal functional magnetic resonance imaging designs in the presence of drift,"Rakhi Singh, John Stufken",2021/1,Journal Statistical Methods in Medical Research,"To study brain activity, by measuring changes associated with the blood flow in the brain, functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques are employed. The design problem in event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging studies is to find the best sequence of stimuli to be shown to subjects for precise estimation of the brain activity. Previous analytical studies concerning optimal functional magnetic resonance imaging designs often assume a simplified model with independent errors over time. Optimal designs under this model are called g-lag orthogonal designs. Recently, it has been observed that g-lag orthogonal designs also perform well under simplified models with auto-regressive error structures. However, these models do not include drift. We investigate the performance of g-lag orthogonal designs for models that incorporate drift parameters. Identifying g-lag orthogonal designs that perform best …",

PERFORMANCE OF SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS FROM AN ANALYSIS PERSPECTIVE,"RAKHI SINGH, JOHN STUFKEN",2019/6/23,Journal Model-Oriented Data Analysis and Optimum Design mODa 12,"Supersaturated designs (SSDs) are useful for factor screening when only a small number of factors are active, which holds under the effect sparsity assumption. For two-level level-balanced SSDs, the E (s2)-criterion chooses a design that minimizes the non-orthogonality among all columns of a design. Jones and Majumdar [1] proposed the UE (s2)-criterion, dropped the requirement of level-balance, and provided simple constructions of UE (s2)-optimal designs for each parameter set. They also showed that there exist many UE (s2)-optimal designs given a parameter set. Given the two criteria, it becomes important to understand if either of these two criteria give designs that perform well from an analysis perspective. Various analysis methods are available for SSDs and it has been observed previously that Dantzig Selector works the best. Since SSDs are eventually used to detect active factors, in this work, we compare designs under different criteria based on their effectiveness for identifying active factors. We observe that the criteria defined above are not sufficiently discriminatory when comparing designs from an analysis perspective and we propose a new discriminatory criterion based on resolution-rank of designs. We also obtain several designs with higher resolution ranks than the ones available in the literature.",

An Invitation: Editor’s Introduction to “Desired and Feared—What Do We Do Now and Over the Next 50 Years?”,John Stufken,2009/8/1,Source The American Statistician,"With enormous amounts of data being collected and complex processes being studied nowadays, opportunities for statisticians are virtually limitless. Most statisticians are involved in some of these opportunities (and, perhaps, occasionally suffer from being pulled into too many), regardless of whether they make a living in academia, industry, or government. This is truly a golden age for statisticians (and for others with quantitative interests and/or skills). At a time that many statisticians flourish, so should statistics as a discipline. At some level this is true and there are many success stories for statistics. But just as individual statisticians can suffer from being pulled into too many activities, the discipline also seems to face serious challenges that result, among others, from an abundance of opportunities. Examples of challenges for the discipline can be found in the interesting articles “A Report on the Future of Statistics …",

Statistical Application of Orthogonal Arrays,"AS Hedayat, NJA Sloane, John Stufken, AS Hedayat, NJA Sloane, John Stufken",1999,Journal Orthogonal Arrays: Theory and Applications,"Rao (1947) introduced orthogonal arrays because of their desirable statistical properties when used in “fractional factorial” experiments. Nowadays the main statistical application of orthogonal arrays, with mixed levels or otherwise, is still as fractional factorials, although other applications have been discovered. We will present the main application in considerable detail, while only giving key references for the other applications. Unless stated otherwise, throughout this chapter the term orthogonal array is to be interpreted as including mixed level arrays.",
Orthogonal Arrays and Difference Schemes,"AS Hedayat, NJA Sloane, John Stufken, AS Hedayat, NJA Sloane, John Stufken",1999,Journal Orthogonal Arrays: Theory and Applications,"In this chapter we introduce the concept of a difference scheme and some of its generalizations. Difference schemes were first defined by Bose and Bush (1952), and are a simple but powerful tool for the construction of orthogonal arrays of strength two.",
Mixed Orthogonal Arrays,"AS Hedayat, NJA Sloane, John Stufken, AS Hedayat, NJA Sloane, John Stufken",1999,Journal Orthogonal Arrays: Theory and Applications,In this chapter we investigate orthogonal arrays in which the various factors may have different numbers of levels — these are called mixed or asymmetrical orthogonal arrays.,
Rao’s Inequalities and Improvements,"AS Hedayat, NJA Sloane, John Stufken, AS Hedayat, NJA Sloane, John Stufken",1999,Journal Orthogonal Arrays: Theory and Applications,"If the other parameters of an orthogonal array are specified, there is a limit on the number of possible factors, imposed by the defining conditions. We shall discuss these restrictions in this chapter and in Chapter 4. Section 2.2 presents the celebrated inequalities found by Rao (dy1947). Section 2.3 discusses improvements on Rao’s bounds for orthogonal arrays of strength two and three. Results on improvements for arrays of general strength are contained in Section 2.4, while Section 2.5 pays special attention to orthogonal arrays in which all the factors are at two levels.",

Orthogonal Arrays and Latin Squares,"AS Hedayat, NJA Sloane, John Stufken, AS Hedayat, NJA Sloane, John Stufken",1999,Journal Orthogonal Arrays: Theory and Applications,"The subject of pairwise or mutually orthogonal Latin squares has fascinated researchers for many years. Although there are a number of intriguing results in this area, many open problems remain to which the answers seem as elusive as ever. The known results, however, are well documented, for example in the books by Dénes and Keedwell (1974, 1991) and Laywine and Mullen (1998), or the article by Jungnickel (1990).",

GRAPH THEORY AND THE EXISTENCE OF LINEAR TREND-FREE BLOCK DESIGNS^,"Win-Chin Lin, John Stufken",1998,Journal Designs for varietal experiments in the presence of trends,"A sufficient condition is given for conversion of a block design, without alteration of its treatment-block incidence matrix, to a linear trend-free design when the block size is odd. This condition is necessary for conversion to a strongly linear trend-free design. Through introduction of a method of representing a block design by a graph and appli cation of Tutte's 1-factor theorem, one variant of the given condition is obtained. This variant condition caji be used to prove that several classes of block designs (including the balanced incomplete block (BIB) designs and balanced block designs) can be converted to linear trend-free designs. The results connect graph theory and linear trend-free block designs, and extend the known cIelsscs of block designs that can be converted to linear trend-free designs.",

Optimal Paired Comparison Designs for Factorial Experiments.,John Stufken,1988/9/1,Source Journal of the American Statistical Association,"Any standard statistical problem can be further complicated by the fact that the variables in terms of which the parameters of interest are defined may not be observable. This broadly defines measurement error problems [see Cochran (1968) for a general discussion]. Although there is a large body of literature on such problems, only recently have they begun to receive the broad attention that they deserve. Fuller's book represents the first full-length treatise on regression models with measurement errors in the independent variables. These problems can also be found under the heading of errors-in-variables. The observable variables are often referred to as proxy variables in economics and as surrogates in epidemiology. Shorter treatments of similar problems can be found in several books, including those by Kendall and Stuart (1979, chap. 29), Zellner (1971, chap. 5), and Judge, Griffiths, Hill, Lutkepohl, and Lee …",

Constrained Multi-objective Designs for Functional MRI Experiments via A Modified NSGA-II,"Ming-Hung Kao, Abhyuday Mandal, John Stufken","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an advanced technology for studying brain functions. Due to the complexity and high cost of fMRI experiments, high quality multi-objective (MO) fMRI designs are in great demand; they help to render precise statistical inference, and are keys to the success of fMRI experiments. Here, we propose an efficient approach for obtaining MO fMRI designs. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed approach does not require users to specify weights for the different objectives, and can easily handle constraints to fulfil customized requirements. Moreover, the underlying statistical models that we consider are more general. We can thus obtain designs for cases where brief, long or varying stimulus durations are utilized.
