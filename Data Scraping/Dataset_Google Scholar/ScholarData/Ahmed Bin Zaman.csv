Balancing multiple objectives in conformation sampling to control decoy diversity in template-free protein structure prediction,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Amarda Shehu",2019/12,Journal BMC bioinformatics,"Computational approaches for the determination of biologically-active/native three-dimensional structures of proteins with novel sequences have to handle several challenges. The (conformation) space of possible three-dimensional spatial arrangements of the chain of amino acids that constitute a protein molecule is vast and high-dimensional. Exploration of the conformation spaces is performed in a sampling-based manner and is biased by the internal energy that sums atomic interactions. Even state-of-the-art energy functions that quantify such interactions are inherently inaccurate and associate with protein conformation spaces overly rugged energy surfaces riddled with artifact local minima. The response to these challenges in template-free protein structure prediction is to generate large numbers of low-energy conformations (also referred to as decoys) as a way of increasing the likelihood of having a diverse decoy dataset that covers a sufficient number of local minima possibly housing near-native conformations. In this paper we pursue a complementary approach and propose to directly control the diversity of generated decoys. Inspired by hard optimization problems in high-dimensional and non-linear variable spaces, we propose that conformation sampling for decoy generation is more naturally framed as a multi-objective optimization problem. We demonstrate that mechanisms inherent to evolutionary search techniques facilitate such framing and allow balancing multiple objectives in protein conformation sampling. We showcase here an operationalization of this idea via a novel evolutionary algorithm that has high exploration …",24
Reducing Ensembles of Protein Tertiary Structures Generated De Novo via Clustering,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Parastoo Kamranfar, Carlotta Domeniconi, Amarda Shehu",2020/1,Journal Molecules,"Controlling the quality of tertiary structures computed for a protein molecule remains a central challenge in de-novo protein structure prediction. The rule of thumb is to generate as many structures as can be afforded, effectively acknowledging that having more structures increases the likelihood that some will reside near the sought biologically-active structure. A major drawback with this approach is that computing a large number of structures imposes time and space costs. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering-based approach which we demonstrate to significantly reduce an ensemble of generated structures without sacrificing quality. Evaluations are related on both benchmark and CASP target proteins. Structure ensembles subjected to the proposed approach and the source code of the proposed approach are publicly-available at the links provided in Section 1.",9
Using Sequence-Predicted Contacts to Guide Template-free Protein Structure Prediction,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Prasanna Venkatesh Parthasarathy, Amarda Shehu",2019/9/4,"Conference Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics","Template-free protein structure prediction seeks three-dimensional structures that organize the serially-bonded amino acids in ways that lower interatomic energy. It is now well understood that energy functions are unreliable guides towards biologically-active structures. This realization raises questions on the proper role and utilization of energy functions. Recent work suggests employing complementary information in the form of amino-acid contacts. Here, we advance this line of work and leverage multi-objective optimization to investigate a variety of combinations of interatomic energy and contact-based scoring. Evaluation on diverse datasets demonstrates the superiority of combining contact information with energy functions in a multi-objective optimization setting for template-free protein structure prediction.",9
Using subpopulation EAs to map molecular structure landscapes,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Kenneth De Jong, Amarda Shehu",2019/7/13,Conference Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference,"The emerging view in molecular biology is that molecules are intrinsically dynamic systems rearranging themselves into different structures to interact with molecules in the cell. Such rearrangements take place on energy landscapes that are vast and multimodal, with minima housing alternative structures. The multiplicity of biologically-active structures is prompting researchers to expand their treatment of classic computational biology problems, such as the template-free protein structure prediction problem (PSP), beyond the quest for the global optimum. In this paper, we revisit subpopulation-oriented EAs as vehicles to switch the objective from classic optimization to landscape mapping. Specifically, we present two EAs, one of which makes use of subpopulation competition to allocate more computational resources to fitter subpopulations, and another of which additionally utilizes a niche preservation technique to …",9

Decoy Ensemble Reduction in Template-free Protein Structure Prediction,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Parastoo Kamranfar, Carlotta Domeniconi, Amarda Shehu",2019/9/4,"Conference Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics","The primary challenge in template-free protein structure prediction is controlling the quality of computed tertiary structures, also known as decoys. While research on how to do so is highly active, the main rule of thumb is to generate as many decoys as can be afforded. This rule acknowledges that more decoys increase the likelihood that some will reside near the sought biologically-active/native structure. Generating large numbers of decoys imposes time and space costs. These costs percolate down to decoy selection algorithms that need to select from the generated decoys a few sufficiently near-native. In this paper, we evaluate the hypothesis that the generated decoy ensemble can be significantly reduced without sacrificing decoy quality. Evaluation on diverse proteins shows that drastic reductions can be achieved in the number of preserved decoys while retaining the quality of generated decoys via clustering …",6
Building maps of protein structure spaces in template-free protein structure prediction,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Amarda Shehu",2019/12/31,Journal Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,"An important goal in template-free protein structure prediction is how to control the quality of computed tertiary structures of a target amino-acid sequence. Despite great advances in algorithmic research, given the size, dimensionality, and inherent characteristics of the protein structure space, this task remains exceptionally challenging. It is current practice to aim to generate as many structures as can be afforded so as to increase the likelihood that some of them will reside near the sought but unknown biologically-active/native structure. When operating within a given computational budget, this is impractical and uninformed by any metrics of interest. In this paper, we propose instead to equip algorithms that generate tertiary structures, also known as decoy generation algorithms, with memory of the protein structure space that they explore. Specifically, we propose an evolving, granularity-controllable map of the …",5
Equipping Decoy Generation Algorithms for Template-free Protein Structure Prediction with Maps of the Protein Conformation Space,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Amarda Shehu",2019/3/18,Journal Proceedings of 11th International Conference,"A central challenge in template-free protein structure prediction is controlling the quality of computed tertiary structures also known as decoys. Given the size, dimensionality, and inherent characteristics of the protein structure space, this is non-trivial. The current mechanism employed by decoy generation algorithms relies on generating as many decoys as can be afforded. This is impractical and uninformed by any metrics of interest on a decoy dataset. In this paper, we propose to equip a decoy generation algorithm with an evolving map of the protein structure space. The map utilizes low-dimensional representations of protein structure and serves as a memory whose granularity can be controlled. Evaluations on diverse target sequences show that drastic reductions in storage do not sacrifice decoy quality, indicating the promise of the proposed mechanism for decoy generation algorithms in template-free protein structure prediction.",5
Protein Decoy Generation via Adaptive Stochastic Optimization for Protein Structure Determination,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Toki Tahmid Inan, Amarda Shehu",2020,Conference 2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),"Many regions of the protein universe remain inaccessible by wet-laboratory or homology modeling methods. Elucidating these regions necessitates structure determination in silico. Protein structure determination in the absence of a structural template remains a challenging task with two core problems, known as decoy generation and decoy selection. In this paper, we address the problem of decoy generation, which inherently involves exploring the unknown, vast, and high-dimensional structure space of a given amino-acid sequence in the presence of a finite computational budget for relevant structures. Leveraging a stochastic optimization framework, we first demonstrate how selection pressure can be employed to control the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Moreover, we then propose a novel algorithm that tunes its behavior towards exploration or exploitation as needed via an adaptive selection …",2
Guiding Protein Conformation Sampling with Conformation Space Maps,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Kenneth De Jong, Amarda Shehu",2022/3/22,Journal Proceedings of 14th International Conference,"Deep learning research, from ResNet to AlphaFold2, convincingly shows that deep learning can predict the native conformation of a given protein sequence with high accuracy. Accounting for the plasticity of protein molecules remains challenging, and powerful algorithms are needed to sample the conformation space of a given amino-acid sequence. In the complex and high-dimensional energy surface that accompanies this space, it is critical to explore a broad range of areas. In this paper, we present a novel evolutionary algorithm that guides its optimization process with a memory of the explored conformation space, so that it can avoid searching already explored regions and search in the unexplored regions. The algorithm periodically consults an evolving map that stores already sampled nonredundant conformations to enhance exploration during selection. Evaluation on diverse datasets shows superior performance of the algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms.",1
Adaptive Stochastic Optimization to Improve Protein Conformation Sampling,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Toki Tahmid Inan, Kenneth De Jong, Amarda Shehu",2021/12/9,Journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,"We have long known that characterizing protein structures structure is key to understanding protein function. Computational approaches have largely addressed a narrow formulation of the problem, seeking to compute one native structure from an amino-acid sequence. Now AlphaFold2 promises to reveal a high-quality native structure for possibly many proteins. However, researchers over the years have argued for broadening our view to account for the multiplicity of native structures. We now know that many protein molecules switch between different structures to regulate interactions with molecular partners in the cell. Elucidating such structures de novo is exceptionally difficult, as it requires exploration of possibly a very large structure space in search of competing, near-optimal structures. Here we report on a novel stochastic optimization method capable of revealing very different structures for a given protein …",1
Evolutionary Techniques for De Novo Protein Conformation Ensemble Generation,Ahmed Bin Zaman,2021,Institution George Mason University,The conformations in which a protein molecule arranges its amino-acid chain are primary determinants of its ability to interact with other molecules in the living cell. Discovering the functionally-relevant conformations of a protein is crucial to elucidating its functional repertoire and even further our understanding of diseases driven by mutations that affect the ability of a protein to assume specific conformations.,1
A Multi-Objective Stochastic Optimization Approach for Decoy Generation in Template-Free Protein Structure Prediction,"Ahmed Bin Zaman, Amarda Shehu",2019/2/15,Journal Biophysical Journal,"Though protein structure determines to a great extent its biological function in the cell, the disparity between the number of protein-encoding gene sequences available in genomic databases and the number of biologically-active protein structures deposited by wet laboratories is more than an order of magnitude. For this reason, computational research in in-silico protein structure determination is very active. In particular, great progress is being made in template-free protein structure prediction, where the goal is to determine the native tertiary structure from a given amino-acid sequence that lacks sequence homologs with known native structures. One of the key challenges in template-free protein structure prediction is to generate a good-quality decoy dataset that captures the underlying energy landscape available to a given protein sequence and, more importantly, contains enough native and near-native decoys …",
