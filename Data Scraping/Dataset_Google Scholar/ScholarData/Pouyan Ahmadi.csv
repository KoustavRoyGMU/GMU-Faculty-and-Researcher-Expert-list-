A robust comparison of the KDDCup99 and NSL-KDD IoT network intrusion detection datasets through various machine learning algorithms,"Suchet Sapre, Pouyan Ahmadi, Khondkar Islam",2019/12/31,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.13204,"In recent years, as intrusion attacks on IoT networks have grown exponentially, there is an immediate need for sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs). A vast majority of current IDSs are data-driven, which means that one of the most important aspects of this area of research is the quality of the data acquired from IoT network traffic. Two of the most cited intrusion detection datasets are the KDDCup99 and the NSL-KDD. The main goal of our project was to conduct a robust comparison of both datasets by evaluating the performance of various Machine Learning (ML) classifiers trained on them with a larger set of classification metrics than previous researchers. From our research, we were able to conclude that the NSL-KDD dataset is of a higher quality than the KDDCup99 dataset as the classifiers trained on it were on average 20.18% less accurate. This is because the classifiers trained on the KDDCup99 dataset exhibited a bias towards the redundancies within it, allowing them to achieve higher accuracies.",40
Analyzing navigational data and predicting student grades using support vector machine,"SriUdaya Damuluri, Khondkar Islam, Pouyan Ahmadi, Namra Shafiq Qureshi",2020/8/1,Journal Emerging Science Journal,"The advent of Learning Management System (LMS) has unfolded a unique opportunity to predict student grades well in advance which benefits both students and educational institutions. The objective of this study is to investigate student access patterns and navigational data of Blackboard (Bb), a form of LMS, to forecast final grades. This research study consists of students who are pursuing a Networking course in Information Science and Technology Department (IST) at George Mason University (GMU). The gathered data consists of a wide variety of attributes, such as the amount of time spent on lecture slides and other learning materials, number of times course contents are accessed, time and days of the week study material is reviewed, and student grades in various assessments. By analyzing these predictors using Support Vector Machine, one of the most efficient classification algorithms available, we are able to project final grades of students and identify those individuals who are at risk for failing the course so that they can receive proper guidance from instructors. After comparing actual grades with predicted grades, it is concluded that our developed model is able to accurately predict grades of 70% of the students. This study stands unique as it is the first to employ solely online LMS data to successfully deduce academic outcomes of students.",23
An outage-aware power saving cooperative routing algorithm in wireless networks,"Pouyan Ahmadi, Bijan Jabbari",2013/4/17,Conference 2013 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium (WTS),"In this paper emphasizing the relation between outage and power, we propose a novel cooperative routing algorithm, called Outage-aware K-shortest paths Cooperative Routing (OKCR), which minimizes the transmitted power while exploiting the merit of cooperative communication. The OKCR algorithm (i.e., inherently based on Yen's Kshortest paths algorithm) finds the best route between the source and the destination considering particular outage probability as its constraint. The proposed algorithm nominates k different optimum routes and then selects the best possible relay in each route on the basis of performance analysis. Simulation results show that this strategy enhances power-efficiency in comparison to non-cooperative and other existing cooperative algorithms investigated in the literature by more than 50%.",6
Speech recognition with a competitive probabilistic radial basis neural network,"Nima Yousefian, Azarakhsh Jalalvand, Pooyan Ahmadi, Morteza Analoui",2008/9/6,Conference 2008 4th International IEEE Conference Intelligent Systems,Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been a subject of active research in the last few decades. In this paper we study the applicability of a special model of radial basis probabilistic neural networks (RBPNN) as a classifier for speech recognition. This type of network is a combination of radial basis function (RBF) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) that applies characteristics of both networks and finally uses a competitive function for computing final result. The proposed network has been tested on the voices of single digit numbers dataset and produced lower recognition error rate in comparison with other common pattern classifiers. All of classifiers use Mel-scale frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) and a special type of perceptual linear predictive (PLP) as their features for classification. Results show that PLP features yield better recognition rate by considering noisy dataset.,6

A comprehensive data sampling analysis applied to the classification of rare iot network intrusion types,"Suchet Sapre, Khondkar Islam, Pouyan Ahmadi",2021/1/9,Conference 2021 IEEE 18th Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC),"With the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) network intrusion attacks, there is a critical need for sophisticated and comprehensive intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Classifying infrequent intrusion types such as root-to-local (R2L) and user-to-root (U2R) attacks is a reoccurring problem for IDSs. In this study, various data sampling and class balancing techniques-Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based oversampling, k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) oversampling, NearMiss-1 undersampling, and class weights-were used to resolve the severe class imbalance affecting U2R and R2L attacks in the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were trained on the adjusted datasets, and their performances were evaluated with a multitude of classification metrics. Here, we show that using no data sampling technique (baseline), GAN-based oversampling, and NearMiss-l undersampling, all …",4

Assessment Formats and Student Learning Performance: What is the Relation?,"Khondkar Islam, Pouyan Ahmadi, Salman Yousaf",2017/7,Conference Proceedings of The 7th Research in Engineering Education Symposium ( REES 2017),"Although compelling assessments have been examined in recent years, more studies are required to yield a better understanding of the several methods where assessment techniques significantly affect student learning process. Most of the educational research in this area does not consider demographics data, differing methodologies, and notable sample size. To address these drawbacks, the objective of our study is to analyse student learning outcomes of multiple assessment formats for a web-facilitated in-class section with an asynchronous online class of a core data communications course in the Undergraduate IT program of the Information Sciences and Technology (IST) Department at George Mason University (GMU).

A Study of Several Classification Algorithms to Predict Students’ Learning Performance,"SriUdaya Damuluri, Pouyan Ahmadi, Khondkar Islam",2019/6,Conference ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition 2019,"Identifying students who need better pedagogical support is an invaluable asset for any academic institution. The main objective of this study is to predict the students’ performance and thereby maximize their learning productivity. We focus on the students’ past academic performance to predict their future results. This is done by analyzing the various factors of course material and students’ online behavior from the Learning Management System (LMS). We also analyze several predictors that contribute to the overall student performance from the data collected. To determine the efficient model that is more accurate and precise, we compare the performance of four well-known machine learning classification algorithms. The 2017 and 2018 academic year data collected consists of user patterns, navigational behavior and the students’ daily activities from the LMS, Blackboard (Bb) Learn of the Undergraduate IT program within the Information Sciences and Technology (IST) Department at George Mason University (GMU).

Minimum outage routing in cooperative multi-hop networks,"Pouyan Ahmadi, Monireh Dabaghchian, Bijan Jabbari",2014/10/13,"Conference Communications in China (ICCC), 2014 IEEE/CIC International Conference on","We consider the joint routing and cooperation diversity problem in multi-hop networks, for which we seek to optimize the end-to-end outage. Simplifying the network structure via partitioning and identifying a set of nodes in each partition, we devise a routing strategy based on cooperative relays in decode-and-forward mode. In particular, this sub-optimal routing algorithm yields the best possible path between the source and destination pragmatically considering the outage probability as the optimization metric. To reduce the amount of required channel state information and the path computation complexity, we introduce a simplified realization, referred to as L-relay ad-hoc, in which a relay selection method based on channel gains is applied at each hop. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods under practical conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed sub-optimal strategy can perform very …",1
Comparing the Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms for Multiclass Network Traffic Classification,"DAN NGUYEN, Pouyan Ahmadi, Khondkar Islam",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"As we move into a technology-based generation, more devices will be in use, increasing network traffic activity. High levels of activity force network operators to be able to segregate traffic quickly and efficiently. This issue brings light to the importance of network traffic classification. Network traffic classifiers are expected to be able to identify the network service that a particular traffic flow belongs to, which is crucial information for network management and security. Recently, the research area has turned to machine learning (ML) algorithms to act as classifiers. With just a few attributes, machine learning classifiers can group traffic flows into classes with high accuracy. In this study, our objective was to compare various machine learning algorithms and find the optimal algorithm for network traffic classification.

Comparison of Various Machine Learning Algorithms in Spatiotemporal Modeling of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone Concentration in California Wildfires,"DAMILOLA AWOFISAYO, Pouyan Ahmadi",2020,Journal Journal of Student-Scientists' Research,"Modern air quality monitors are quite sparse spatially and only record data only a few times a day. Much research has gone into the prediction of air quality concentration in normal situations. However, not much has gone into the study of such concentrations in wildfires, which pose a greater threat to human health by producing greater amounts of fine particulate matter (PM2. 5) and ozone (O3). This study compares 7 different machine learning algorithms, 4 linear and 3 nonlinear, by creating spatiotemporal models of ozone and PM2. 5 data. The linear models tested were linear regression, ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and elastic net regularization while the nonlinear algorithms used were random forest and two forms of extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST). Using data from the EPA ozone and PM2. 5 monitors in California during 2017 wildfires, the models aim to …",
