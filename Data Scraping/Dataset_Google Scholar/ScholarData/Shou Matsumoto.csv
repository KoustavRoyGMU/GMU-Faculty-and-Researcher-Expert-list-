Probabilistic Ontology and Knowledge Fusion for Procurement Fraud Detection in Brazil.,"Rommel N Carvalho, Shou Matsumoto, Kathryn B Laskey, Paulo Cesar G da Costa, Marcelo Ladeira, Laécio L Santos",2013/1/9,Conference URSW (LNCS Vol.),"To cope with citizens’ demand for transparency and corruption prevention, the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General (CGU) has carried out a number of actions, including: awareness campaigns aimed at the private sector; campaigns to educate the public; research initiatives; and regular inspections and audits of municipalities and states. Although CGU has collected information from hundreds of different sources-Revenue Agency, Federal Police, and others-the process of fusing all this data has not been efficient enough to meet the needs of CGU’s decision makers. Therefore, it is natural to change the focus from data fusion to knowledge fusion. As a consequence, traditional syntactic methods should be augmented with techniques that represent and reason with the semantics of databases.

A first-order Bayesian tool for probabilistic ontologies,"Paulo CG Costa, Marcelo Ladeira, Rommel N Carvalho, Kathryn B Laskey, Laécio L Santos, Shou Matsumoto",2008/5/15,Journal Proceedings of the Twenty-First International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference,"One of the major weaknesses of current research on the Semantic Web (SW) is the lack of proper means to represent and reason with uncertainty. A number of recent efforts from the SW community, the W3C, and others have recently emerged to address this gap. Such efforts have the positive side effect of bringing together two fields of research that have been apart for historical reasons, the artificial intelligence and the SW communities. One example of the potential research gains of this convergence is the current development of Probabilistic OWL (PROWL), an extension of the OWL Web Ontology Language that provides a framework to build probabilistic ontologies, thus enabling proper representation and reasoning with uncertainty within the SW context. PR-OWL is based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN), a first-order probabilistic logic that combines the representational power of first-order logic (FOL) and Bayesian Networks (BN). However, PR-OWL and MEBN are still in development, lacking a software tool that implements their underlying concepts. The development of UnBBayes-MEBN, an open source, Java-based application that is currently in alpha phase (public release March 08), addresses this gap by providing both a GUI for building probabilistic ontologies and a reasoner based on the PR-OWL/MEBN framework. This work focuses on the major challenges of UnBBayes-MEBN implementation, describes the features already implemented, and provides an overview of the major algorithms, mainly the one used for building a Situation Specific Bayesian Network (SSBN) from a MEBN Theory.",47
Multi-entity bayesian networks learning in predictive situation awareness,"Cheol Y Park, Kathryn B Laskey, Paulo Costa, Shou Matsumoto",2013/6/1,Publisher GEORGE MASON UNIV FAIRFAX VA VOLGENAU SCHOOL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING,"Over the past two decades, machine learning has led to substantial changes in Data Fusion Systems globally. One of the most important application areas for data fusion is situation awareness to support command and control. Situation awareness is perception of elements in the environment, comprehension of the current situation, and projection of future status before decision making. Traditional fusion systems focus on lower levels of the JDL hierarchy, leaving higher-level fusion and situation awareness largely to unaided human judgment. This becomes untenable in todays increasingly data-rich environments, characterized by information and cognitive overload. Higher-level fusion to support situation awareness requires semantically rich representations amenable to automated processing. Ontologies are an essential tool for representing domain semantics and expressing information about entities and relationships in the domain. Probabilistic ontologies augment standard ontologies with support for uncertainty management, which is essential for higher-level fusion to support situation awareness. PROGNOS is a prototype Predictive Situation Awareness PSAW System for the maritime domain. The core logic for the PROGNOS probabilistic ontologies is Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks MEBN, which combine First-Order Logic with Bayesian Networks for representing and reasoning about uncertainty in complex, knowledge-rich domains.

High-level information fusion with bayesian semantics,"Paulo CG Costa, Kathryn B Laskey, Kuo-Chu Chang, Wei Sun, Cheol Y Park, Shou Matsumoto",2012/8,Journal Proceedings of the 9th Bayesian Modelling Applications Workshop,"In an increasingly interconnected world information comes from various sources, usually with distinct, sometimes inconsistent semantics. Transforming raw data into high-level information fusion (HLIF) products, such as situation displays, automated decision support, and predictive analysis, relies heavily on human cognition. There is a clear lack of automated solutions for HLIF, making such systems prone to scalability issues. In this paper, we propose to address this issue with the use of highly expressive Bayesian models, which can provide a tighter link between information coming from low-level sources and the high-level information fusion systems, and allow for greater automation of the overall process. We illustrate our ideas with a naval HLIF system, and show the results of a preliminary set of experiments.",22
Predictive situation awareness reference model using multi-entity bayesian networks,"Cheol Young Park, Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, Paulo CG Costa, Shou Matsumoto",2014/7/7,Conference 17th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION),"Predictive Situation Awareness (PSAW) emphasizes the ability to make predictions about aspects of a temporally evolving situation. Higher-level fusion to support PSAW requires a semantically rich representation to handle complex real world situations and the ability to reason under uncertainty about the situation. Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN) are rich enough to represent and reason about uncertainty in complex, knowledge-rich domains. In previous applications of MEBN to PSAW, the models, called MTheories, were constructed from scratch for each application. Designing models from scratch is inefficient and fails to build on the experience gained from prior work. In this paper, we argue that applications of MEBN to PSAW share similar goals and common model elements. We propose a reference model for designing a MEBN model for PSAW and evaluate our model on a case study of a defense system.",21
UnBBayes-MEBN: comments on implementing a probabilistic ontology tool,"Rommel N Carvalho, Marcelo Ladeira, Laécio L Santos, Shou Matsumoto, Paulo CG Costa",2008,Conference IADIS International Conference Applied Computing 2008,"Paper Abstract: The quest for principled approaches to represent and reason under uncertainty in the Semantic Web (SW) is a very active research subject.

There’s No More Need to be a Night OWL: on the PR-OWL for a MEBN Tool Before Nightfall,"Shou Matsumoto, Rommel N Carvalho, PC Costa, Kathryn B Laskey, Laécio L Dos Santos, Marcelo Ladeira",2011,"Source Introduction to the Semantic Web: Concepts, Technologies and Applications","The area of semantics and services has been extremely active in recent years. Advances in making semantic information explicit and machine-interpretable were key to effectively exploit data from disparate sources. In such context, Web Semantic technologies, such as ontologies-explicit formal definition of common set of terms describing and representing domains and their relations-have emerged as an integration framework to record, distinguish, operate, and integrate web resources. The ability to support inferential reasoning makes ontologies a promising tool for knowledge management. Traditional ontology languages, such as the Web Ontology Language-OWL (Patel-Schneider et al., 2004; Heflin, 2004), allow computers to effectively infer multiple meanings for a word, such as “night,” 1 but it lacks the ability to finely grade their respective plausibility within contexts. This limitation comes directly from the fact that inferential reasoning in traditional ontologies relies on different flavors of classical logic to support automated reasoning.",12

Graphical model market maker for combinatorial prediction markets,"Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, Wei Sun, Robin Hanson, Charles Twardy, Shou Matsumoto, Brandon Goldfedder",2018/11/7,Journal Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,"We describe algorithms for use by prediction markets in forming a crowd consensus joint probability distribution over thousands of related events. Equivalently, we describe market mechanisms to efficiently crowdsource both structure and parameters of a Bayesian network. Prediction markets are among the most accurate methods to combine forecasts; forecasters form a consensus probability distribution by trading contingent securities. A combinatorial prediction market forms a consensus joint distribution over many related events by allowing conditional trades or trades on Boolean combinations of events. Explicitly representing the joint distribution is infeasible, but standard inference algorithms for graphical probability models render it tractable for large numbers of base events. We show how to adapt these algorithms to compute expected assets conditional on a prospective trade, and to find the conditional state where a trader has minimum assets, allowing full asset reuse. We compare the performance of three algorithms: the straightforward algorithm from the DAGGRE (Decomposition-Based Aggregation) prediction market for geopolitical events, the simple block-merge model from the SciCast market for science and technology forecasting, and a more sophisticated algorithm we developed for future markets.",5

PR-OWL decision: A framework for decision making with probabilistic ontologies,Shou Matsumoto,2019,Institution George Mason University,"Ontologies (in the context of computer science) are engineering artifacts which formally represent knowledge in a domain, and are widely used as an instrument for enabling common understanding of the information among people or software agents.

Study of MEBN Learning for Relational Model.,"Cheol Young Park, Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, Paulo Cesar G da Costa, Shou Matsumoto",2012,Conference STIDS,"(SRL) has emerged as a new branch of machine learning for representing and learning a joint probability distribution over relational data. Relational representations have the necessary expressive power for important real-world problems, but until recently have not supported uncertainty. Statistical relational models fill this gap. Among the languages recently developed for statistical relational representations is Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN). MEBN is the logical basis for Probabilistic OWL (PR-OWL), a language for uncertainty reasoning in the Semantic Web. However, until now there has been no implementation of MEBN learning. This paper describes the first implementation of MEBN learning. The algorithm learns a MEBN theory for a domain from data stored in a relational Database. Several issues are addressed such as aggregating influences, optimization problem, and so on. In this paper, as our contributions, we will provide a MEBN-RM (Relational Model) Model which is a bridge between MEBN and RM, and suggest a basic structure learning algorithm for MEBN.

Gaussian mixture reduction for time-constrained approximate inference in hybrid Bayesian networks,"Cheol Young Park, Kathryn Blackmond Laskey, Paulo CG Costa, Shou Matsumoto",2019/5/18,Journal Applied Sciences,"Hybrid Bayesian Networks (HBNs), which contain both discrete and continuous variables, arise naturally in many application areas (e.g., image understanding, data fusion, medical diagnosis, fraud detection). This paper concerns inference in an important subclass of HBNs, the conditional Gaussian (CG) networks, in which all continuous random variables have Gaussian distributions and all children of continuous random variables must be continuous. Inference in CG networks can be NP-hard even for special-case structures, such as poly-trees, where inference in discrete Bayesian networks can be performed in polynomial time. Therefore, approximate inference is required. In approximate inference, it is often necessary to trade off accuracy against solution time. This paper presents an extension to the Hybrid Message Passing inference algorithm for general CG networks and an algorithm for optimizing its accuracy given a bound on computation time. The extended algorithm uses Gaussian mixture reduction to prevent an exponential increase in the number of Gaussian mixture components. The trade-off algorithm performs pre-processing to find optimal run-time settings for the extended algorithm. Experimental results for four CG networks compare performance of the extended algorithm with existing algorithms and show the optimal settings for these CG networks.",2
Predictive Situation Awareness for Ebola Virus Disease using a Collective Intelligence Multi-Model Integration Platform: Bayes Cloud,"Cheol Young Park, Shou Matsumoto, Jubyung Ha, YoungWon Park",2019/4/29,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.12958,"The humanity has been facing a plethora of challenges associated with infectious diseases, which kill more than 6 million people a year. Although continuous efforts have been applied to relieve the potential damages from such misfortunate events, it is unquestionable that there are many persisting challenges yet to overcome. One related issue we particularly address here is the assessment and prediction of such epidemics. In this field of study, traditional and ad-hoc models frequently fail to provide proper predictive situation awareness (PSAW), characterized by understanding the current situations and predicting the future situations. Comprehensive PSAW for infectious disease can support decision making and help to hinder disease spread. In this paper, we develop a computing system platform focusing on collective intelligence causal modeling, in order to support PSAW in the domain of infectious disease. Analyses of global epidemics require integration of multiple different data and models, which can be originated from multiple independent researchers. These models should be integrated to accurately assess and predict the infectious disease in terms of holistic view. The system shall provide three main functions: (1) collaborative causal modeling, (2) causal model integration, and (3) causal model reasoning.
