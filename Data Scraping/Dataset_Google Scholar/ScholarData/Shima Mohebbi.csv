Wastewater-based resource recovery technologies across scale: a review,"Nancy Diaz-Elsayed, Nader Rezaei, Tianjiao Guo, Shima Mohebbi, Qiong Zhang",2019/6/1,"Source Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Over the past few decades, wastewater has been evolving from a waste to a valuable resource. Wastewater can not only dampen the effects of water shortages by means of water reclamation, but it also provides the medium for energy and nutrient recovery to further offset the extraction of precious resources. Since identifying viable resource recovery technologies can be challenging, this article offers a review of technologies for water, energy, and nutrient recovery from domestic and municipal wastewater through the lens of the scale of implementation. The system scales were classified as follows: small scale (design flows of 17 m3/day or less), medium scale (8 to 20,000 m3/day), and large scale (3800 m3/day or more). The widespread implementation of non-potable reuse (NPR) projects across all scales highlighted the ease of implementation associated with lower water quality requirements and treatment …",137

Coalitional game theory approach to modeling suppliers' collaboration in supply networks,"Shima Mohebbi, Xueping Li",2015/11/1,Journal International Journal of Production Economics,"Suppliers' collaboration is a new paradigm to improve the utilization of collective intelligence in supply networks. Although existing literature advocates the notion of cooperation in supply networks, there is a dearth of studies quantitatively analyzing cost and benefit of cooperation. In this study, we first develop a model for suppliers' dynamic coalition formation using coalitional game theory. The proposed cost structure influences the utility of each possible coalition and restricts the coalition size and search space for finding possible coalitions. To distribute the profit earned by cooperation in a fair manner, a criterion named Shared Capacity Index is developed according to suppliers' capacity share in the corresponding coalition. A suppliers' cooperation algorithm is then proposed to resolve possible conflicts among network members whereby each supplier is able to explore coalitional structures autonomously. The …",50

Game theory methodology for optimizing retailers’ pricing and shelf-space allocation decisions on competing substitutable products,"Xueping Li, Sirisha Nukala, Shima Mohebbi",2013/9,Journal The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,"This paper examines the influence of competition among supply chain partners on product demand. A power law demand function that depends on product pricing and shelf-space allocation (SSA) is used. The exponents in the power law are given by the elasticities of demand. In order to achieve the optimal pricing and SSA strategies in the presence of competition, game-theory-based methodologies—Cournot and Stackelberg games—are employed. For each type of game, a Nash equilibrium is achieved by optimizing the profit as a function of demand and price. A case study is presented to demonstrate the potential of this methodology. The results of this study indicate (1) how to achieve optimal pricing and SSA strategies, (2) how manufacturers can influence demand for a product, (3) that both prices and profits decrease using the Stackelberg game as compared with the Cournot game, and (4) that …",27

In order to develop the model, 200 different mixes are cast in the laboratory as a part of an extensive experimental research program. The data used in the ANN model are arranged in a format of fourteen input parameters covering water-binder ratio, four different mineral additives (calcium carbonate, metakaolin, silica fume, and limestone), five different superplasticizers based on the poly carboxylate and naphthalene and four different Viscosity Modified Admixtures (VMAs). Two common output parameters including the mini slump value and flow cone time are chosen for measuring the rheological properties of fresh self consolidating cement paste. Having validated the model, the influence of effective parameters on the rheological properties of fresh self consolidating cement paste is investigated based on the ANN model outputs. The output results of the model are then compared with the results of previous studies performed by other researchers. Ultimately, the analysis of the model outputs determines the optimal percentage of additives which has a strong influence on the rheological properties of fresh self consolidating cement paste. The proposed ANN model shows that metakaolin and silica fume affect the rheological properties in the same manner. In addition, for providing the suitable rheological properties, the ANN model introduces the optimal percentage of metakaolin, silica fume, calcium carbonate and limestone as 15, 15, 20 …",16

However, quantitative investigations are hardly found that modeled the mechanism of the interaction among players within buyers or within suppliers, which can be the ground for the creation of coalition and sharing of experiences and information. We introduce the concept of a hierarchical coordination mechanism which allows the members of the network to share information both vertically and horizontally. In this study, the coordination process is viewed as the process where negotiators jointly search for a mutually acceptable partner through multi-agent technologies. The agents pursue individual optimal decision and interact with each other to achieve compatible and global optimization. Supply network is considered as a collection of agent-mediated decision and coordination mechanisms in a web-based environment. It provides reliable and dynamic activities to achieve high performance supply networks in both service level and coherent decision making.",1

Ensemble framework for causality learning with heterogeneous Directed Acyclic Graphs through the lens of optimization,"Babak Aslani, Shima Mohebbi",2023/1/20,Journal Computers & Operations Research,"Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are informative graphical outputs of causal learning algorithms to visualize the causal structure among variables. In practice, different causal learning algorithms are often used to establish a comprehensive analysis pool, which leads to the challenging problem of ensembling the heterogeneous DAGs with diverse and conflicting embedded information. While naive approaches such as MEDIAN and greedy heuristics are presented in the literature, a mathematical framework to build the ensemble DAG is not investigated. Therefore, we propose a two-stage ensemble framework for causality learning with heterogeneous DAGs. In the first stage, we implement a data partitioning procedure to categorize the input data. Then, we apply multiple causal learning algorithms to each class and ensemble the results across the partitions for each method. The results across different approaches in …",

Spatial Agent-Based Simulation of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles to Assess Impacts on Traffic Conditions,"Shima Mohebbi, Pavithra Sripathanallur Murali",2022/12/11,Conference 2022 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC),"Traffic congestion and its effect on aging transportation infrastructures have been a significant issue in many cities. Various policies such as fast-track lanes have been applied to optimize traffic on roadways. However, the increasing adoption of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) motivates the question of whether they can reduce traffic congestion. This study aims to evaluate the integration of CAVs into existing transportation networks, comprising of both highway and urban roads. To quantify their impact, we develop and validate agent-based simulation models. Two study sites in the State of Oklahoma were identified. We then implemented connected cruise control, green light optimized speed advisory, dynamic route selection, and pedestrians' detection as behaviors for CAVs in the simulation. The results indicated that introducing CAVs to the selected road networks improved the traffic flow by more …",
The State-of-the-Art Survey on Optimization Methods for Cyber-physical Networks,"Babak Aslani, Shima Mohebbi, Edward J Oughton",2022/10/7,Source arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.03642,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasingly complex and frequently integrated into modern societies via critical infrastructure systems, products, and services. Consequently, there is a need for reliable functionality of these complex systems under various scenarios, from physical failures due to aging, through to cyber attacks. Indeed, the development of effective strategies to restore disrupted infrastructure systems continues to be a major challenge. Hitherto, there have been an increasing number of papers evaluating cyber-physical infrastructures, yet a comprehensive review focusing on mathematical modeling and different optimization methods is still lacking. Thus, this review paper appraises the literature on optimization techniques for CPS facing disruption, to synthesize key findings on the current methods in this domain. A total of 108 relevant research papers are reviewed following an extensive assessment of all major scientific databases. The main mathematical modeling practices and optimization methods are identified for both deterministic and stochastic formulations, categorizing them based on the solution approach (exact, heuristic, meta-heuristic), objective function, and network size. We also perform keyword clustering and bibliographic coupling analyses to summarize the current research trends. Future research needs in terms of the scalability of optimization algorithms are discussed. Overall, there is a need to shift towards more scalable optimization solution algorithms, empowered by data-driven methods and machine learning, to provide reliable decision-support systems for decision-makers and practitioners.",

Designing a Coordination Mechanism to Support Healthcare Providers Consolidation,"Shima Mohebbi, Xueping Li",2014,Journal IIE Annual Conference. Proceedings,"This paper concentrates on the issue of healthcare providers' collaboration, leading to more efficient health outcomes. The proposed coordination mechanism begins with the selection of feasible and most promising healthcare providers for patients based on the similarity of requirements and the providers' profile in a multidimensional space defined by health attributes. A global health objective is then defined to align the activities of providers while the individual and conflict objectives are taken into account. This approach allows for quantifying different collaboration scenarios and synergies among providers. To allocate the benefit of collaboration in a fair manner, the cooperative game theory is utilized providing an incentive for providers to follow the coordination mechanism. The efficiency of the proposed approach is examined via simulation studies. Results demonstrate that collaboration among healthcare …",
