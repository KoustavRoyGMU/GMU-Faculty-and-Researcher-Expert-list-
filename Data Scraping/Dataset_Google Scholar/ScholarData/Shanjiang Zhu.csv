The traffic and behavioral effects of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse,"Shanjiang Zhu, David Levinson, Henry X Liu, Kathleen Harder",2010/12/1,Journal Transportation research part A: policy and practice,"On August 1, 2007, the collapse of the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis abruptly interrupted the usual route of about 140,000 daily vehicle trips, which substantially disturbed regular traffic flow patterns on the network. It took several weeks for the network to re-equilibrate, during which period travelers continued to learn and adjust their travel decisions. A good understanding of this process is crucial for traffic management and the design of mitigation schemes. Data from loop-detectors, bus ridership statistics, and a survey are analyzed and compared, revealing the evolving traffic reactions to the bridge collapse and how individual choices could help to explain such dynamics. Findings on short-term traffic dynamics and behavioral reactions to this major network disruption have important implications for traffic management in response to future scenarios.",230
Do people use the shortest path? An empirical test of Wardrop’s first principle,"Shanjiang Zhu, David Levinson",2015/8/12,Journal PloS one,"Most recent route choice models, following either the random utility maximization or rule-based paradigm, require explicit enumeration of feasible routes. The quality of model estimation and prediction is sensitive to the appropriateness of the consideration set. However, few empirical studies of revealed route characteristics have been reported in the literature. This study evaluates the widely applied shortest path assumption by evaluating routes followed by residents of the Minneapolis—St. Paul metropolitan area. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) data were employed to reveal routes people used over an eight to thirteen week period. Most people did not choose the shortest path. Using three weeks of that data, we find that current route choice set generation algorithms do not reveal the majority of paths that individuals took. Findings from this study may guide future efforts in building better route choice models.",228
Disruptions to transportation networks: a review,"Shanjiang Zhu, David M Levinson",2011/8/30,Source Network Reliability in Practice: Selected Papers from the Fourth International Symposium on Transportation Network Reliability,"Travel decisions may be very stable in a familiar environment. Major network disruptions such as the I-35W bridge collapse disrupt habitual behavior. Such “natural” experiments provide unique opportunities for behavioral studies, but the time window for such studies is limited. A well-developed methodology is crucial for both data collection and analysis, and thus the soundness of behavioral models, especially in such a limited time window. Therefore, this paper reviews both theoretical and empirical studies on traffic and behavioral impacts of network disruptions. Findings from this paper offer prospective ideas about capturing the impacts of network disruption.",97
"Analysis of Washington, DC taxi demand using GPS and land-use data","Zhuo Yang, Mark L Franz, Shanjiang Zhu, Jina Mahmoudi, Arefeh Nasri, Lei Zhang",2018/1/1,Journal Journal of Transport Geography,"Taxis remain a key asset for urban mobility despite the tremendous growth of modern mobility-on-demand service providers such as Uber and Lyft. A fundamental understanding of the factors that impact the taxi demand is essential for planning an effective multi-modal transportation system, and can also shed lights on new on-demand services. This study addressed a gap in literature by investigating the correlation between demand for taxi, land use patterns, and accessibility to other modes using detailed GPS and GIS information collected from the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. The results of the models showed a strong link between demand for taxi, land use patterns, and accessibility to other modes. Mixed land use did not show a strong correlation with taxi demand. The study also found that the taxi mode is likely to complement metro trips, but compete with bus trips, although both of these modes of travel …",91
"Agent-based model of price competition, capacity choice, and product differentiation on congested networks","Lei Zhang, David M Levinson, Shanjiang Zhu",2008/9/1,Journal Journal of Transport Economics and Policy (JTEP),"Using consistent agent-based techniques, this research explores the welfare consequences of product differentiation on congested networks. The economic analysis focuses on the source, evolution, measurement, and impact of product differentiation with heterogeneous users on a mixed ownership network. Path differentiation and space differentiation are defined and measured for a base scenario and several variants. The findings favour a fixed-rate road pricing policy compared to complete pricing freedom on toll roads. It is also shown that the impact of production differentiation on welfare is not always positive and depends on the level of user heterogeneity.",76
Potentials of using social media to infer the longitudinal travel behavior: A sequential model-based clustering method,"Zhenhua Zhang, Qing He, Shanjiang Zhu",2017/12/1,Journal Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,"This study explores the possibility of employing social media data to infer the longitudinal travel behavior. The geo-tagged social media data show some unique features including location-aggregated features, distance-separated features, and Gaussian distributed features. Compared to conventional household travel survey, social media data is less expensive, easier to obtain and the most importantly can monitor the individual’s longitudinal travel behavior features over a much longer observation period. This paper proposes a sequential model-based clustering method to group the high-resolution Twitter locations and extract the Twitter displacements. Further, this study details the unique features of displacements extracted from Twitter including the demographics of Twitter user, as well as the advantages and limitations. The results are even compared with those from traditional household travel survey, showing …",66
A portfolio theory of route choice,"David Levinson, Shanjiang Zhu",2013/10/1,Journal Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,"Although many individual route choice models have been proposed to incorporate travel time variability as a decision factor, they are typically still deterministic in the sense that the optimal strategy requires choosing one particular route that maximizes utility. In contrast, this study introduces an individual route choice model where choosing a portfolio of routes instead of a single route is the best strategy for a rational traveler who cares about both journey time and lateness when facing stochastic network conditions. The proposed model is compared with UE and SUE models and the difference in both behavioral foundation and model characteristics is highlighted. A numerical example is introduced to demonstrate how such model can be used in traffic assignment problem. The model is then tested with GPS data collected in metropolitan Minneapolis–St. Paul, Minnesota. Our data suggest there is no single dominant …",50
Indifference bands for boundedly rational route switching,"Xuan Di, Henry X Liu, Shanjiang Zhu, David M Levinson",2017/9,Journal Transportation,"The replacement I-35W bridge in Minneapolis saw less traffic than the original bridge though it provided substantial travel time saving for many travelers. This observation cannot be explained by the classical route choice assumption that travelers always take the shortest path. Accordingly, a boundedly rational route switching model is proposed assuming that travelers will not switch to the new bridge unless travel time saving goes beyond a threshold or “indifference band”. Indifference bands are assumed to follow lognormal distribution and are estimated in two specifications: the first one assumes every driver’s indifference band is drawn from a population indifference band and the second one assumes that the mean of drivers’ indifference bands is a function of their own characteristics. Route choices of 78 subjects from a GPS travel behavior study were analyzed before and after the addition of the new I …",47
Integrating an agent-based travel behavior model with large-scale microscopic traffic simulation for corridor-level and subarea transportation operations and planning applications,"Lei Zhang, Gang-Len Chang, Shanjiang Zhu, Chenfeng Xiong, Longyuan Du, Mostafa Mollanejad, Nathan Hopper, Subrat Mahapatra",2013/6/1,Journal Journal of Urban Planning and Development,"Application of microscopic traffic simulation beyond the corridor level analysis is not widely seen in literature. This is partly because of the fact that a simulation model cannot capture behavior responses such as peak spreading. This study develops a framework that integrates agent-based travel behavior models with large-scale traffic simulation to capture the regional impacts of new development. The proposed model is then applied to the I-270/I-495/I-95 corridor in the north Washington, DC metropolitan area in a case study. Findings from this study reveal the potential of the proposed model to capture network dynamics and behavioral reactions. This framework also provides a valuable tool for the evaluation of new transportation infrastructure, such as the intercounty connector (ICC) corridor currently under construction, and its operation strategies.",45

The objective of this research is to study the impact of introducing a new $2 fare for single-trip on revenue and ridership at Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) in the metro Washington DC region. The single-trip fare (STF) at CaBi is one of the three fare products aimed at casual users—the other two being 24-h pass and 3-day pass. STF was introduced inconjuction with SafeTrack, which is a major Metrorail track maintenance program intiated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. The impact analysis of STF includes studying the influence of SafeTrack on CaBi ridership.

The roads taken: Theory and evidence on route choice in the wake of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse and reconstruction,Shanjiang Zhu,2010,Institution University of Minnesota,"Route choice analysis investigates the path travelers follow to implement their travel plan. It is the most frequent, and thus arguably the most important decision travelers make on a daily basis. Long established efforts have been dedicated to a normative model of the route choice decision, while investigations of route choice from a descriptive perspective have been limited. Wardrop's first principle, or the shortest path assumption, is still widely used in route choice models.

The co-evolution of land use and road networks,"David Matthew Levinson, Feng Xie, Shanjiang Zhu",2007/7/1,Journal Transportation and traffic theory,"Transportation and land use are interdependent shapers of urban form. First, changes in land use alter travel demand patterns, which determine traffic flows on transportation infrastructure. Second, changed traffic flows drive the improvement of transportation facilities. Third, new transportation facilities change the accessibility pattern, which drives the re-location of activities and land uses. During this process, both transportation and land use are evolving constantly, leading to salient spatial transformations such as agglomeration and centralization over space and transportation networks. For example, as cities evolved in the first half of the 20th century, we saw a concentration of activities and development at the centers of cities. As freeways were constructed from the 1960s, roads also became more differentiated with regard to their functional designs and running speeds (certainly in the pre-auto era most unpaved streets were equally slow, with paved streets and highways and then freeways, some roads got much faster). Urban agglomeration and differentiated highway networks are referred to as hierarchical systems in this study.",38
"Rationing and pricing strategies for congestion mitigation: behavioral theory, econometric model, and application in Beijing","Shanjiang Zhu, Longyuan Du, Lei Zhang",2013/6/7,Journal Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences,"Some travel demand management policies such as road pricing have been widely studied in literature. Rationing poli- cies, including vehicle ownership quota and vehicle usage restrictions, have been implemented in several megaregions to address congestion and other negative transportation externalities, but not well explored in literature. Other strategies such as Vehicle Mileage Fee have not been well accepted by policy makers, but attract growing research interest. As policy makers face an increasing number of policy tools, a theoretical framework is needed to analyze these policies and provide a direct comparison of their welfare implications such as efficiency and equity. However, such a comprehensive framework does not exist in literature. To bridge this gap, this study develops an analytical framework for analyzing and comparing travel demand management policies, which consists of a mathematical …",35

Using detailed GPS data to estimate travel times on links and for origin-destination pairs, this research finds that while on average travel time improved with the reopening of the bridge, the subsequent restoration of parts of the rest of the network to their pre-collapse configuration worsened travel times significantly on average. In all cases, the distribution of winners and losers indicates clear spatial patterns associated with these network changes.",25
Capturing value of reliability through road pricing in congested traffic under uncertainty,"Shanjiang Zhu, Gege Jiang, Hong K Lo",2018/9/1,Journal Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,"Empirical studies showed that travel time reliability, usually measured by travel time variance, is strongly correlated with travel time itself. Travel time is highly volatile when the demand approaches or exceeds the capacity. Travel time variability is associated with the level of congestion, and could represent additional costs for travelers who prefer punctual arrivals. Although many studies propose to use road pricing as a tool to capture the value of travel time (VOT) savings and to induce better road usage patterns, the role of the value of reliability (VOR) in designing road pricing schemes has rarely been studied. By using road pricing as a tool to spread out the peak demand, traffic management agencies could improve the utility of travelers who prefer punctual arrivals under traffic congestion and stochastic network conditions. Therefore, we could capture the value of travel time reliability using road pricing, which is …",24

Many previous studies in this area described the stationary behavior of stochastic transportation systems using user equilibrium (UE) conditions. In contrast, this paper develops a generalized Bayesian model to analyze the dynamic behavior of stochastic transportation systems. In the proposed model, the variability of link volume and travel time stems from the stochasticity in travel demand, transportation supply (e.g. link capacity, free flow travel time, etc.) and route choice. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first work that considers the three sources of stochasticity simultaneously.

Based on a previously developed generalized Bayesian traffic model, we propose different types of perceived knowledge (i.e., mean-variance-based type, relative gap-based type, and penalty-based type) to model travelers’ daily route choice behavior concerning travel time reliability. We theoretically demonstrate the flexibility of the generalized Bayesian model in capturing various existing UE-based travel behaviors and other non-UE-based travel behaviors (e.g., penalty-based) in stochastic transportation systems. Three major conclusions are obtained. First, the route choice dynamics induced by the Bayesian model with an infinitely long memory and mean-variance-based perceived knowledge will converge to the mean-variance UE condition. Second, the convergence of route choice dynamics to a UE condition is not affected by …",19

An agent-based route choice model,"Shanjiang Zhu, David Matthew Levinson, Lei Zhang",2007/4/28,Journal Available at SSRN 1743621,"Travel demand emerges from individual decisions. These decisions, depending on individual objectives, preferences, experiences and spatial knowledge about travel, are both heterogeneous and evolutionary. Research emerging from fields such as road pricing and ATIS requires travel demand models that are able to consider travelers with distinct attributes (value of time (VOT), willingness to pay, travel budgets, etc.) and behavioral preferences (eg willingness to switch routes with potential savings) in a differentiated market (by tolls and the level of service). Traditional trip-based models have difficulty in dealing with the aforementioned heterogeneity and issues such as equity. Moreover, the role of spatial information, which has significant influence on decision-making and travel behavior, has not been fully addressed in existing models. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes to explicitly model the formation and spreading of spatial knowledge among travelers. An Agent-based Route Choice (ARC) model was developed to track choices of each decision-maker on a road network over time and map individual choices into macroscopic flow pattern. ARC has been applied on both Sioux Falls network and Chicago sketch network. Comparison between ARC and existing models (UE and SUE) on both networks shows ARC is valid and computationally tractable.

Previous studies exclusively focused on single-depot ISRP, but this study extends the problem to a multidepot case, which is more applicable in practice. To quickly generate an optimal solution, this study proposes an efficient solution heuristic that consists of four consecutive steps: site assignment, vehicle routing design, delivery quantity scheduling, and site reassignment.

Traffic flow and road user impacts of the collapse of the I-35W Bridge over the Mississippi River,"Shanjiang Zhu, David Levinson, Henry Liu, Kathleen Harder, Adam Dancyzk",2010,"Publisher Minnesota Department of Transportation, Research Services Section","Major network disruptions have significant impacts on local travelers. A good understanding of behavioral reactions to such incidents is crucial for traffic mitigation, management, and planning. Existing research on such topics is limited. The collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge (August 1, 2007) abruptly disrupted habitual routes of about 14,000 daily trips and forced even more travelers to adapt their travel pattern to evolving network conditions. The opening of the replacement bridge on November 18, 2008 generated another disturbance (this time predictable) on the network. Such “natural” experiments provide unique opportunities for behavioral studies. This study focuses on the traffic and behavioral reactions to both bridge collapse and bridge reopening and contributes to general knowledge by identifying unique patterns following different events. Three types of data collection efforts have been conducted during the appropriate frame of reference (i.e. before vs. after bridge reconstruction): 1) GPS tracking data and associated user surveys, 2) paper and internet-based survey data gauging travel behavior in the post-bridge reconstruction phase, and 3) aggregate data relating to freeway and arterial traffic flows, traffic control, and transit ridership. Differences in reactions to planned versus unplanned events were revealed. Changes in travel cost were evaluated and their temporal and spatial patterns were analyzed.

Planned and unplanned disruptions to transportation networks,"Shanjiang Zhu, David Levinson",2008/8,"Journal Transportation Research Synthesis, Minnesota Department of Transportation, Office of Investment Management","The collapse, on August 1, 2007, of the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, abruptly interrupted the usual route of about 140,000 daily vehicle trips and substantially disturbed the flow pattern of the network. In addition to the heavy losses in life and injury, the network disruption has also significantly impacted road-users and reshaped travel patterns in the Twin Cities area, which could generate significant cost due to longer travel distance, higher levels of congestion, and the resulting opportunity losses. According to Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT), rerouting alone could cost individual travelers and commercial vehicles $400,000 daily based on Metropolitan Council planning model. Xie and Levinson (2008) find a lower, but still large, estimate of expected costs to road users, between $71,000 and $220,000 per day. As a result, a significant financial incentive was given to the contractor for the early completion of the replacement bridge. A similar financial incentive was employed after the Northridge Earthquake in California (the transportation-related costs due to network disruption in Los Angeles basin exceeded $1.6 million per day (Wesemann et al., 1996)) and a contractor earned $14.8 million ($200,000 per day) for completing work on freeway I-10 66 days ahead of initial schedule.

Bounding box approach to network pruning for efficient path search through large networks,"Xi Zhou, Mohan Venigalla, Shanjiang Zhu",2017/9/1,Journal Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering,"In this paper, the term network pruning is used to describe the process of extracting an appropriate subnetwork from a larger network for efficient and accurate path search.

Economic model for vehicle ownership quota policies and applications in China,"Shanjiang Zhu, Longyuan Du, Chenfeng Xiong, Lei Zhang",2013/11/6,Journal Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences,"Traffic congestion has caused huge economic loss and environmental pollution every year. As a demand management policy to reduce congestion, vehicle ownership quota system that directly controls the number of vehicles on the road has recently been adopted in some metropolitan areas including Beijing and Shanghai. When it comes to implementation of quota system, Beijing uses the plate lottery system, so that everyone interested in owning a vehicle can participate and there's no monetary transaction in the process.

An economic model for vehicle ownership quota and usage restriction policy analysis.,Shanjiang Zhu,2012,"Description Rationing policies, including vehicle ownership quota and vehicle usage restrictions, have been implemented in several megaregions to address congestion and other negative transportation externalities. However, no model is available in the literature that allows direct comparison of these rationing policies. To bridge this gap, this study develops an analytical framework for analyzing and comparing transportation rationing policies, which consists of a mathematical model of joint household vehicle ownership and usage decisions and welfare analysis methods based on compensating variation and consumer surplus. Under the assumptions of homogenous users and single time period, this study finds that vehicle usage rationing performs better when relatively small percentages of users (i.e. low rationing ratio) are rationed off the roads and when induced demand resulting from congestion mitigation is low. When the amount of induced demand exceeds a certain level, it is shown analytically that vehicle usage restrictions will always cause welfare losses. When the policy goal is to reduce vehicle travel by a large portion (i.e. high rationing ratio), the net social benefits of vehicle ownership quota rationing policy become more obvious. The optimal rationing ratios for both rationing policies can be determined by the model, and are influenced by network congestion and congestibility. A comparison with pricing policy is also provided to illustrate their difference under various conditions. Various policy implications, as well as future research directions, are also discussed.","Rationing policies, including vehicle ownership quota and vehicle usage restrictions, have been implemented in several megaregions to address congestion and other negative transportation externalities.

Agent-based route choice with learning and exchange of information,"Shanjiang Zhu, David Matthew Levinson, Lei Zhang",2008,Source Transportation Research Board 87th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"Route choice is one of the most important choice dimensions in travel demand modeling. Research emerging from fields such as road pricing and advanced traveler Information systems (ATIS) requires travel demand models that are able to consider travelers with distinct attributes (value of time (VOT), willingness to pay, travel budgets, etc.) and behavioral preferences (eg willingness to switch routes with potential savings) in a differentiated market (where routes have varying tolls and levels of service). Traditional trip-based models have difficulty in dealing with the aforementioned heterogeneity and issues such as equity. Moreover, the role of spatial information, which has significant influence on decision-making and travel behavior, has not been fully addressed in existing models. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes to explicitly model the formation and spreading of spatial knowledge among travelers, following cognitive map theory. An Agent-based Route Choice (ARC) model was developed to track choices of each individual decision-maker in a road network over time and map individual choices into macroscopic flow pattern. ARC has been applied to both the Sioux Falls and Chicago sketch networks. Comparisons between ARC and existing models (UE and SUE) on both networks show ARC is valid and computationally tractable. To be brief, this paper specifically focuses on the route choice behavior, while the proposed model can be extended to other modules of travel demand under an integrated framework.",10
Population exposure to ultrafine particles: Size-resolved and real-time models for highways,"Shanjiang Zhu, Julian D Marshall, David Levinson",2016/12/1,Journal Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment,"Prior research on ultrafine particles (UFP) emphasizes that concentrations are especially high on-highway, and that time on highways contribute disproportionately to total daily exposures. This study estimates individual and population exposure to ultra-fine particles in the Minneapolis – St. Paul (Twin Cities) metropolitan area, Minnesota. Our approach combines a real-time model of on-highway size-resolved UFP concentrations (32 bins, 5.5–600 nm); individual travel patterns, derived from GPS travel trajectories collected in 144 individual vehicles (123 h at locations with UFP estimates among 624 vehicle-hours of travel); and, loop-detector data, indicating real-time traffic conditions throughout the study area.

Travel patterns of frequent and non-frequent users on I-66 high-occupancy toll lanes and implications for the value of time estimation,"Mecit Cetin, Shanjiang Zhu, Hong Yang, Olcay Sahin",2021/9,Journal Transportation research record,"Based on a three-month toll transaction data set that includes an anonymized unique identifier for each vehicle, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of traffic volumes and tolls on the I-66 High-Occupancy Toll (HOT) express lanes in Northern Virginia. The unique identifiers allow quantification of how frequently each vehicle travels through the corridor. Vehicles observed in selected time intervals are categorized into frequent and non-frequent groups based on the total number of trips made by each vehicle. For the morning commute, the analyses show that those traveling frequently on the HOT lanes are more sensitive to high tolls and typically travel earlier in the morning to avoid higher tolls. In other words, when tolls are relatively high (e.g., over $20), the fraction of frequent users in the traffic is much smaller as compared with that of non-frequent users (e.g., 25% versus 75%). To estimate how much toll the HOT …",3

Agent-based approach for integrating departure time and dynamic traffic assignment models,"Lei Zhang, Mostafa Mollanejad, Chenfeng Xiong, Shanjiang Zhu",2013,Source Transportation Research Board 92nd Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"The dynamic analysis of transportation networks has received much attention through the past two decades. Likewise, departure time choice models have been well studied due to their importance in dealing with peak-period traffic congestion. This paper describes research on the integration of simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) and a positive behavioral departure time model, which has been seldom discussed in the existing literature. The positive agent-based modeling approach in this paper requires longitudinal behavioral process data, but helps overcome certain limitations of traditional utility-based models and focuses more on how individuals actually make departure time and routing choices. The resulting agent-based modeling framework consists of three components: departure time choice, dynamic route choice, and dynamic network loading. By considering departure time and dynamic routing decisions together, we can more comprehensively evaluate traffic operations strategies and transportation planning scenarios. In the proposed agent-based model, fixed overall travel demand is assigned to departure time intervals and travel routes based on individuals’ day-to-day learning of the traffic pattern simulated with a DTA module. In a large-scale real-world demonstration, this agent-based approach is applied to analyze the peak spreading and route diversion effects of a new toll road project (with time-of-day pricing) in Maryland. The effect of time discretization, an important consideration in dynamic network/demand analysis, on model output is also explored and discussed.",3
Modelling changes in travel behaviour mechanisms through a high-order hidden Markov model,"Zheng Zhu, Shanjiang Zhu, Lijun Sun, Atabak Mardan",2022/10/8,Journal Transportmetrica A: Transport Science,"Integrating complicated travel behaviour mechanisms into transportation studies is necessary for understanding and modelling urban mobility. However, insufficient research has been conducted in this direction, especially when travellers make decisions using different mechanisms. This study develops a data-driven framework to model day-to-day route choice dynamics, in which different interpretable travel decision-making mechanisms and efficient model training algorithms are incorporated. The route choice is estimated following a Dirichlet distribution. By introducing a high-order hidden Markov state model, the framework can detect the routine and sudden changes of the mechanism and apply them accordingly for prediction. We propose a particle-based Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate model parameters. As a pioneering work that links transportation data with different behaviour mechanisms …",2

Improving Inventory of and Investment in Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities Through Targeted Public Outreach,"Shanjiang Zhu, Atabak Mardan, Zhou Yang",2020/1/1,Issue FHWA/VTRC 20-R17,"The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) is committed to providing and maintaining transportation infrastructure for a transportation system of multiple modes, including bicycling and walking. A complete and well-maintained bicycle and pedestrian facility inventory is critical for that mission. Given the large number of bicycle and pedestrian facilities, it is impractical to rely exclusively on VDOT staff for all data collection, processing, and maintenance efforts. A crowdsourcing approach that leverages inputs from volunteers, student interns, or both offers an attractive alternative. In addition, VDOT needs better communication channels to reach out to facility users and collect feedback on facility conditions and needs. The objective of this project is to develop a practical and effective crowdsourcing method for engaging targeted users of VDOT bicycle and pedestrian facilities to improve the existing inventory and meet the data needs for investment prioritization. To achieve this objective, this project reviewed mainstream crowdsourcing approaches that have been applied in the field of transportation and evaluated their applicability in the context of this project. The project team also interviewed agencies of localities in Northern Virginia to understand their practices and bicycling and pedestrian advocacy groups to understand the perspective of potential users. On the basis of these findings, this project developed a hybrid framework to achieve the research objective by integrating geoanalysis, crowdsourcing approaches, and targeted public outreach efforts. The results of this project led to the following conclusions:(1) among the mainstream …",1

Exploration of Corridor-Based Tolling Strategies for Virginia’s Express Toll Lanes,"Shanjiang Zhu, Mecit Cetin, Hong Yang, Olcay Sahin, Atabak Mardan",2021/8/1,Issue FHWA/VTRC 22-R5,"Virginia has invested significant resources in the development of express toll lanes (ETLs), which adjust toll rates dynamically based on the level of toll lane usage. A tool is needed to investigate the potential impact of the I-66 Outside-the-Beltway (OTB) ETLs on regional traffic patterns. This study developed a microscopic traffic simulation model in TransModeler to evaluate a set of corridor-based tolling strategies for the I-66 ETLs in NOVA. This model also considered the changes in vehicle occupancy, mode split, and departure time among travelers because of tolls based on locally collected data. An interactive map-based analyzer based on the simulation results was created to support quick scenario analysis and decision-making. I-66 OTB ETLs are estimated to bring tangible travel time improvements to the entire corridor. The simulation model showed that, compared to traffic conditions before the opening of the I-66 OTB ETLs, eastbound travel time along the general purpose lanes improved during the morning peak period by as much as 36.1% for the segment between Gainesville and Rt. 28, and 13.2% for the segment between Rt. 28 and I-495, respectively. During the afternoon peak period, Westbound travel time improved by as much as 17% for the segment between I-495 and Rt. 28, and 7.4% between Rt. 28 and Gainesville, respectively. The simulation model showed that the I-66 OTB ETLs would serve about 6,645 and 8,774 vehicles at a point right before the interchange with I-495, during the morning peak and the afternoon peak periods, respectively. When combined with the traffic on the general purpose lanes, the total throughputs …",
Guidelines for Prioritizing Curb Ramp Retrofits Under the Americans With Disabilities Act,"Hannah E MacKnight, Peter B Ohlms, T Donna Chen, Shanjiang Zhu",2021/3/1,Issue FHWA/VTRC 21-R18,"Each year, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) invests millions of dollars retrofitting curb ramps to put them in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In 2019, VDOT’s Traffic Engineering Division (TED) completed an inventory of accessibility barriers, finding that approximately 80% of VDOT’s 80,000 curb ramps were noncompliant. As part of its Americans with Disabilities Act Transition Plan, VDOT has developed a plan to retrofit these curb ramps. To prioritize ramp improvements, TED uses a functional condition rating system that is based on ramp width, type of detectable warning surface, and material condition. The purpose of this study was to identify—for a curb ramp improvement program—best practices in prioritization, investment, and program management. The scope was limited to curb ramps, with the prioritization of sidewalk improvements generally falling outside that scope. The study entailed the following seven tasks:(1) reviewing existing state and national standards and guidance,(2) reviewing the literature related to curb ramps and prioritization processes,(3) gathering information from other states and VDOT districts regarding curb ramp prioritization processes,(4) conducting a survey of Virginia agencies and organizations that work with people with vision or mobility impairments and/or older adults,(5) assessing quantitative prioritization approaches,(6) comparing prioritization processes explored in the prior two tasks, and (7) identifying program performance metrics and developing program guidelines.

A Generalized Day-to-Day Bayesian Learning Traffic Model,"Zheng Zhu, Shanjiang Zhu, Zhengfei Zheng, Hai Yang",2020,"Description The rapid growth of transportation data offers new opportunities to analyze the interaction between travel behavior and transportation system performance, and particularly when issues such as uncertainty and reliability are considered. Many previous studies in this area described the stationary behavior of stochastic transportation systems using user equilibrium (UE) conditions. In contrast, this paper develops a generalized Bayesian model to analyze the dynamic behavior of stochastic transportation systems. In the proposed model, the variability of link volume and travel time stems from the stochasticity in travel demand, transportation supply (e.g. link capacity , free flow travel time, etc.) and route choice. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first work that considers the three sources of stochasticity simultaneously. In addition, we propose a Bayesian updating approach based on the Dirichlet model to describe the route choice behavior. This approach allows researchers to consider a wide range of route choice behavior of bounded rationality in day-today traffic dynamics, including a knowledge updating mechanism based on different memory lengths and weighting factors. This framework is particularly suitable for data-driven studies supported by emerging transportation data due to the computing efficiency of the Dirichlet-based Bayesian updating mechanism and the sound behavioral foundation.

Decipher Travel Behavior Using Longitudinal Data: The Psychology of Route Choice in Familiar Networks,"Mohan Venigalla, Xi Zhou, Shanjiang Zhu",2018/1,"Description It is widely accepted that path choice of a trip is dependent on trip characteristics, network attributes, and traveler’s personal characteristics. The best-known network variables that influence route-choice are travel distance and travel time. This research attempts to study the influence of other network variables, namely signals, turns and roadway classification on route choice. Real world trip data from path trajectories tracked by Global Positioning System (GPS) in an urban area are used to isolate nearly 5,700 unique real paths. Procedures to compute theoretical shortest time path (STP) and shortest distance path (SDP) based on travel time and distance as impedance variables, respectively, are developed. Street network data is augmented with data on signalized intersections. Procedures to identify turns, quantify turn penalties and road classes along the real and theoretical paths are developed. The real paths are compared to their STP and SDP counterparts to identify discernible relationships between the network variables and the path choice.","It is widely accepted that path choice of a trip is dependent on trip characteristics, network attributes, and traveler’s personal characteristics.

"Price Elasticity of American Toll Roads: Historical Evidence, Panel Data Analysis, and Policy Implications","Jeong Yun Kweun, Shanjiang Zhu, Jonathan Gifford",2017/8,"Description Empirical analysis of price elasticity on US toll roads is urgently needed in policy debates and investment decision-making as the transportation infrastructure needs grow rapidly and the market for Private-Public Partnership is expanding in many States. This project first reviews the historical evidence on toll elasticity reported in literature, and then developed a database of US toll road to examine both the traveler’s responsiveness to road pricing and whether functional class and geographic coverage of the toll facility explains the variation in estimates of road pricing elasticity of demand. A dynamic panel data analysis of travel demand data for 64 US toll roads in 15 states from 2004 to 2013 shows that the short-run price elasticity is smaller for urban toll roads than intercity roads and smaller for interstate than non-interstate toll roads. One explanation is that despite the availability of free alternative routes in urban areas, free routes are not practical to use due to higher travel cost and reduced travel time savings because of congestion in urban areas.

Transportation.","Shanjiang Zhu, David M Levinson, Henry Liu",2016,"Description The opening of the replacement for the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge on September 18th, 2008 provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the impacts generated by this additional link on network performance. Using detailed GPS data to estimate travel times on links and for origin-destination pairs, this research finds that while on average travel time improved with the reopening of the bridge, the subsequent restoration of parts of the rest of the network to their pre-collapse configuration worsened travel times significantly on average. In all cases, the distribution of winners and losers indicates clear spatial patterns associated with these network changes.","The opening of the replacement for the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge on September 18th, 2008 provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the impacts generated by this additional link on network performance.

Understanding the Interaction of Multiple Jurisdictions for Highway Investment: Viability of Public-Private Partnership Alternatives 2!,"Nobuhiko Daito, Shanjiang Zhu, Jonathan L Gifford",2015,Source Transportation Research Board 94th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board,"2! Observing that highway public-private partnerships (P3s) have been rare for projects that cross 3! jurisdictional boundaries, this study attempts to evaluate strategic interactions of multiple 4! governments in terms of their road network investment, with the prospect to partner with a 5! private firm. There is a gap in the literature regarding network level analyses of investment 6! behavior in partnership with the private sector. In undertaking this complex analysis, this paper 7! presents a model with which to investigate how governments strategically interact with each 8! other in making these decisions. Numerical analysis of the model on a highly stylized highway 9! network was conducted to serve as the foundation for investigating various complex policy 10! alternatives not only on stylized networks but also on real highway networks. The analysis 11! demonstrated that two jurisdictions, in maximizing respective welfare given the best response of 12! the counterpart, raised toll and increased the capacity for the link that served inter-jurisdictional 13! commuters, relative to the other links. Welfare losses and negative profitability resulted. The 14! analysis suggested the analytical framework could be a tool to inform decision makers on 15! possible consequences of various policy scenarios, including the use of P3s for such contexts. 16! 17!",
Analysis of Highway Exposure to Ultra Fine Particles,"Shanjiang Zhu, Julian D Marshall, David Levinson",2012/8/1,Source University of Minnesota: Nexus Research Group Working Papers,"Studies on on-road exposure to UFP are under-reported compared to UFP con-2 centration studies in literature. This study investigates both individual and population 3 exposure to ultra-fine particle in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, Minnesota, by com-4 bining an on-road UFP concentration model with people’s travel patterns derived from 5 different traffic monitoring data sources. Spatial and temporal patterns of exposure to 6 UFP among freeway users are revealed through analysis of loop-detector traffic data, 7 while individual exposure is estimated based on GPS travel trajectories. A few hot 8 spots near major freeway interchanges represents a majority of total exposure to UFP, 9 and the exposure during workday morning and afternoon peak periods is the highest. 10 Significant disparity in individual exposure to UFP among population is observed. In 11 general, individual exposure to UFP follows a log-normal distribution. Findings from 12 this paper could significantly inform future epidemiological studies in on-road exposure 13 to UFP. 14",
Strategic Patrol Vehicle Location-Allocation Model for Freeway Incident Responses,"Shanjiang Zhu, Woon Kim, Gang-Len Chang",2011,Conference 18th ITS World CongressTransCoreITS AmericaERTICO-ITS EuropeITS Asia-Pacific,"This study discusses an application of an integer programming to develop the strategy for strategically locating incident response units over a large network so as to minimize incident response time. The developed model is applied for the Capital Beltway in Maryland, and the results are compared to alternatives strategies considered by practitioners. The advantage of the proposed model, especially for the multiple-unit case, implies its potential for the significant reduction in incident response time once implemented.",
"The Hierarchy of Roads, the Locality of Traffic, and Governance","Shanjiang Zhu, David Levinson",2011,Source University of Minnesota: Nexus Research Group Working Papers,"This study investigates the usage of road networks both within and outside of home jurisdictions (city (or town) and county of residence) by analyzing GPS data collected in the Minneapolis - Saint Paul metropolitan area, which tracked volunteersâ€™ travel behavior to determine which roads (and thus which class of roads) users chose to accommodate their travel needs. More than half of the travel on county roads and city streets occur outside of oneâ€™s home city, but most travel is within oneâ€™s home county. The average share of travel distance in the home county is more than 70 percent for both county and city streets. The high share, which does not even account for non-residents destined for the county to work or shop, e.g., implies that the free rider problem on city and county streets at the county level is minimal. Of particular con- cern is travel on city roads in cities other than oneâ€™s own. To the extent that this is to go to a destination in that city, that travel is also local. However, because city and county roads are typically funded by those jurisdictions from land-based sources such as property taxes, through trips with neither end in the city through which they are traveling are in a very real sense ""free riders"", and pose a problem. With growing trip lengths and emerging economies of scale in road management, it may be appropriate to consider moving more roads from township, town, or city level to the county level of government.",
Travels Impacts of Bridge Closures 2: Saint Croix River Bridges Final Report,"David M Levinson, Shanjiang Zhu",2010/9/13,"Description This report is prepared at the request Abby McKenzie and Ed Idzorek of MnDOT to assess the expected traveler impacts of replacing or not replacing the Saint Croix River Bridge in Stillwater, Minnesota. The model that has previously been used to evaluate different Lafayette Bridge replacement scenarios is applied, using the 20 county (“collar counties”) network from the Metropolitan Council and best estimates of 2010 land uses (population and employment). The model evaluates changes in travel cost due to network reconfigurations corresponding to different scenarios. These costs would need to be compared against construction and ongoing operations and maintenance costs, and do not account for factors such as travel time reliability, the value of a redundant network for planned or unplanned closures, or changes in land use. It can be safely assumed that were a wider, faster bridge constructed there would be more development, and thus more travel demand from the Wisconsin side of the Saint Croix River. If no replacement bridge were built, we can assume that less growth (if any) would occur, and cross-river traffic would diminish. This model does not account for changes in land use, as we do not believe this has been accurately forecast for scenarios both with and without the bridge, but does account for changes in demand given the current land use under different network configurations. This is denoted as “Variable Trip Tables” in the report.

Travels Impacts of Bridge Closures 1: Lafayette Bridge Final Report,"David M Levinson, Shanjiang Zhu",2010/9/13,"Description This study evaluates traffic reactions to two alternative construction plans of Lafayette Bridge crossing the Mississippi River in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota. We calibrate a travel demand model previously developed and evaluate network performance in dif- ferent construction phases of the two alternative scenarios. Most significant changes in traffic condition occur during the bridge closure phase of scenario 2. The measur- able impacts of bridge closure on traffic conditions are limited within the region of I-494 and US 61 to the east and I-35E to the west. The increases in freeway traffic are moderate. Most travelers choose to use the arterial bridges as alternative routes. The Robert Street Bridge and the Wabasha Street Bridge will see significant traffic increases. Overall changes in consumer surplus indicate that scenario 2 has a some- what higher user cost ($5,209/day). However, the magnitude of difference in consumer surplus is very small and well within “margin of error”. The ultimate decision needs to consider construction cost savings due to faster construction, and safety issues in addition to changes in user cost.","This study evaluates traffic reactions to two alternative construction plans of Lafayette Bridge crossing the Mississippi River in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Access to Destinations: Monitoring Land Use Activity Changes in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Region,"Michael Iacono, David Levinson, Ahmed El-Geneidy, Rania Wasfi, Shanjiang Zhu",2008,Publisher Minnesota Department of Transportation,"This study presents an effort to track and model land use change in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Region. To that end, we make use of a unique, high-resolution, cell-level set of land use data for the Twin Cities. The data represent 75 meter by 75 meter land use cells, observed at several points in time during the period from 1958 to 2005. These data are used to validate three different types of land use models, which then are used to forecast land use several decades into the future. The models applied in this study include Markov Chain models, Markov Chain- Cellular Automata (MC-CA) models, and an empirical model based on a logistic regression specification. The models are intended to have a simple, transparent structure that allows the user to identify sources of forecast error. Forecasts of land use are made both for the entire study area and also for a specific corridor along State Highway 610 in the northwestern suburbs of the Twin Cities. The study concludes with a brief discussion of the limitations of the models, and how they might meaningfully be expanded and applied.",
Monitoring Multi-modal Travel Demand Month-by-month through Data Fusion and Integration,"Zhuo Yang, Bo Peng, Yixuan Pan, Shanjiang Zhu, Lei Zhang","Conventional travel behavior data collection methods such as the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) have been the primary source of travel behavior information for transportation agencies. However, the relatively high cost of traditional travel surveys often prohibits frequent survey cycles. With decision makers increasingly requesting recent and up-to-date information on multimodal travel trends, establishing a sustainable and timely travel monitoring program based on available data sources from the public domain is in order. This paper develops a package of methods that are tailored to data of different quality for different modes in the public domain, and can collectively reveal month-to-month travel trends dynamically in a metropolitan area. The proposed methods will be demonstrated through case studies in three different metropolitan areas. A comparison with mode split trend based on household survey data collected in the same metropolitan area showed the effectiveness of the proposed method. Future studies will further address the data gap and reliability issue.","Scholar articles Monitoring Multi-modal Travel Demand Month-by-month through Data Fusion and IntegrationZ Yang, B Peng, Y Pan, S Zhu, L Zhang","Conventional travel behavior data collection methods such as the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) have been the primary source of travel behavior information for transportation agencies.
