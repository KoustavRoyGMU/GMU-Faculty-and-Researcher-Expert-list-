Semantics-based obfuscation-resilient binary code similarity comparison with applications to software plagiarism detection,"Lannan Luo, Jiang Ming, Dinghao Wu, Peng Liu, Sencun Zhu",2014/11/11,Book Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSOFT international symposium on foundations of software engineering," Existing code similarity comparison methods, whether source or binary code based, are mostly not resilient to obfuscations. In the case of software plagiarism, emerging obfuscation techniques have made automated detection increasingly difficult. In this paper, we propose a binary-oriented, obfuscation-resilient method based on a new concept, longest common subsequence of semantically equivalent basic blocks, which combines rigorous program semantics with longest common subsequence based fuzzy matching. We model the semantics of a basic block by a set of symbolic formulas representing the input-output relations of the block. This way, the semantics equivalence (and similarity) of two blocks can be checked by a theorem prover. We then model the semantics similarity of two paths using the longest common subsequence with basic blocks as elements. This novel combination has resulted in strong …",233
Neural machine translation inspired binary code similarity comparison beyond function pairs,"Fei Zuo, Xiaopeng Li, Patrick Young, Lannan Luo, Qiang Zeng, Zhexin Zhang",2019,Conference Proceedings of the 26th Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS),"Binary code analysis allows analyzing binary code without having access to the corresponding source code. A binary, after disassembly, is expressed in an assembly language. This inspires us to approach binary analysis by leveraging ideas and techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), a rich area focused on processing text of various natural languages. We notice that binary code analysis and NLP share a lot of analogical topics, such as semantics extraction, summarization, and classification. This work utilizes these ideas to address two important code similarity comparison problems. (I) Given a pair of basic blocks for different instruction set architectures (ISAs), determining whether their semantics is similar or not; and (II) given a piece of code of interest, determining if it is contained in another piece of assembly code for a different ISA. The solutions to these two problems have many applications, such as cross-architecture vulnerability discovery and code plagiarism detection. We implement a prototype system INNEREYE and perform a comprehensive evaluation. A comparison between our approach and existing approaches to Problem I shows that our system outperforms them in terms of accuracy, efficiency and scalability. And the case studies utilizing the system demonstrate that our solution to Problem II is effective. Moreover, this research showcases how to apply ideas and techniques from NLP to large-scale binary code analysis.",167
Semantics-based obfuscation-resilient binary code similarity comparison with applications to software and algorithm plagiarism detection,"Lannan Luo, Jiang Ming, Dinghao Wu, Peng Liu, Sencun Zhu",2017/1/18,Journal IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,"Existing code similarity comparison methods, whether source or binary code based, are mostly not resilient to obfuscations. Identifying similar or identical code fragments among programs is very important in some applications. For example, one application is to detect illegal code reuse. In the code theft cases, emerging obfuscation techniques have made automated detection increasingly difficult. Another application is to identify cryptographic algorithms which are widely employed by modern malware to circumvent detection, hide network communications, and protect payloads among other purposes. Due to diverse coding styles and high programming flexibility, different implementation of the same algorithm may appear very distinct, causing automatic detection to be very hard, let alone code obfuscations are sometimes applied.

Touch well before use: Intuitive and secure authentication for iot devices,"Xiaopeng Li, Fengyao Yan, Fei Zuo, Qiang Zeng, Lannan Luo",2019/10/11,Book The 25th annual international conference on mobile computing and networking,"Internet of Things (IoT) are densely deployed in smart environments, such as homes, factories and laboratories, where many people have physical access to IoT devices. How to authenticate users operating on these devices is thus an important problem. IoT devices usually lack conventional user interfaces, such as keyboards and mice, which makes traditional authentication methods inapplicable. We present a virtual sensing technique that allows IoT devices to virtually sense user 'petting' (in the form of some very simple touches for about 2 seconds) on the devices. Based on this technique, we build a secure and intuitive authentication method that authenticates device users by comparing the petting operations sensed by devices and those captured by the user wristband. The authentication method is highly secure as physical operations are required, rather than based on proximity. It is also intuitive, adopting …",41
Repackage-proofing Android Apps,"Lannan Luo, Yu Fu, Dinghao Wu, Sencun Zhu, Peng Liu",2016,Conference Proceedings of the 46th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2016),"App repackaging has become a severe threat to theAndroid ecosystem. While various protection techniques, such as watermarking and repackaging detection, have been proposed, a defense that stops repackaged apps from working on user devices, i.e., repackage-proofing, is missing. We propose a technique that builds a reliable and stealthy repackage-proofing capability into Android apps. A large number of detection nodes are inserted into the original app without incurring much overhead, each is woven into the surrounding code to blur itself. Once repackaging is detected, a response node injects a failure in the form of delayed malfunctions, making it difficult to trace back. The response nodes and detection nodes form high-degree connections and communicate through stealthy communication channels, such that upon detection several of the many response nodes are selected stochastically to take actions …",41
A cross-architecture instruction embedding model for natural language processing-inspired binary code analysis,"Kimberly Redmond, Lannan Luo, Qiang Zeng",2019,Conference The NDSS Workshop on Binary Analysis Research (BAR),"Given a closed-source program, such as most of proprietary software and viruses, binary code analysis is indispensable for many tasks, such as code plagiarism detection and malware analysis. Today, source code is very often compiled for various architectures, making cross-architecture binary code analysis increasingly important. A binary, after being disassembled, is expressed in an assembly languages. Thus, recent work starts exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) inspired binary code analysis. In NLP, words are usually represented in high-dimensional vectors (i.e., embeddings) to facilitate further processing, which is one of the most common and critical steps in many NLP tasks. We regard instructions as words in NLP-inspired binary code analysis, and aim to represent instructions as embeddings as well. To facilitate cross-architecture binary code analysis, our goal is that similar instructions, regardless of their architectures, have embeddings close to each other. To this end, we propose a joint learning approach to generating instruction embeddings that capture not only the semantics of instructions within an architecture, but also their semantic relationships across architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on building cross-architecture instruction embedding model. As a showcase, we apply the model to resolving one of the most fundamental problems for binary code similarity comparison---semantics-based basic block comparison, and the solution outperforms the code statistics based approach. It demonstrates that it is promising to apply the model to other cross-architecture binary code analysis tasks.",40
A multiversion programming inspired approach to detecting audio adversarial examples,"Qiang Zeng, Jianhai Su, Chenglong Fu, Golam Kayas, Lannan Luo",2019,Conference Proceedings of the 49th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN),"Adversarial examples (AEs) are crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to inputs such that a machine-learning based classifier incorrectly labels them. They have become a severe threat to the trustworthiness of machine learning. While AEs in the image domain have been well studied, audio AEs are less investigated. Recently, multiple techniques are proposed to generate audio AEs, which makes countermeasures against them urgent. Our experiments show that, given an audio AE, the transcription results by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems differ significantly (that is, poor transferability), as different ASR systems use different architectures, parameters, and training datasets. Based on this fact and inspired by Multiversion Programming, we propose a novel audio AE detection approach MVP-Ears, which utilizes the diverse off-the-shelf ASRs to determine whether an audio is an AE.

Resilient decentralized android application repackaging detection using logic bombs,"Qiang Zeng, Lannan Luo, Zhiyun Qian, Xiaojiang Du, Zhoujun Li",2018/2/24,Book Proceedings of the 2018 International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization,"Application repackaging is a severe threat to Android users and the market.

We instead consider building the detection capability into apps, such that user devices are made use of to detect repackaging in a decentralized fashion. The main challenge is how to protect repackaging detection code from attacks. We propose a creative use of logic bombs, which are regularly used in malware, to conquer the challenge. A novel bomb structure is invented and used: the trigger conditions are constructed to exploit the differences between the attacker and users, such that a bomb that lies dormant on the attacker side will be activated on one of the user devices, while the repackaging detection code, which is packed as the bomb payload, is kept inactive …",34

Proximity-based pairing approaches are very usable, but can be exploited by co-located malicious devices. Approaches based on a user's physical operations on IoT devices are more secure, but typically require inertial sensors, while many devices do not satisfy this requirement.

Pfirewall: Semantics-aware customizable data flow control for home automation systems,"Haotian Chi, Qiang Zeng, Xiaojiang Du, Lannan Luo",2019/10/17,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.07987,"Emerging Internet of Thing (IoT) platforms provide a convenient solution for integrating heterogeneous IoT devices and deploying home automation applications. However, serious privacy threats arise as device data now flow out to the IoT platforms, which may be subject to various attacks. We observe two privacy-unfriendly practices in emerging home automation systems: first, the majority of data flowed to the platform are superfluous in the sense that they do not trigger any home automation; second, home owners currently have nearly zero control over their data. We present PFirewall, a customizable data-flow control system to enhance user privacy. PFirewall analyzes the automation apps to extract their semantics, which are automatically transformed into data-minimization policies; these policies only send minimized data flows to the platform for app execution, such that the ability of attackers to infer user privacy is significantly impaired. In addition, PFirewall provides capabilities and interfaces for users to define and enforce customizable policies based on individual privacy preferences. PFirewall adopts an elegant man-in-the-middle design, transparently executing data minimization and user-defined policies to process raw data flows and mediating the processed data between IoT devices and the platform (via the hub), without requiring modifications of the platform or IoT devices. We implement PFirewall to work with two popular platforms: SmartThings and openHAB, and set up two real-world testbeds to evaluate its performance. The evaluation results show that PFirewall is very effective: it reduces IoT data sent to the platform by 97% and …",23

Exploiting the inherent limitation of l0 adversarial examples,"Fei Zuo, Bokai Yang, Xiaopeng Li, Qiang Zeng",2019,"Conference 22nd International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses (RAID 2019)","Despite the great achievements made by neural networks on tasks such as image classification, they are brittle and vulnerable to adversarial example (AE) attacks, which are crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to inputs in order that a neural-network-based classifier incorrectly labels them. In particular, L 0 AEs are a category of widely discussed threats where adversaries are restricted in the number of pixels that they can corrupt. However, our observation is that, while L 0 attacks modify as few pixels as possible, they tend to cause large-amplitude perturbations to the modified pixels. We consider this as an inherent limitation of L 0 AEs, and thwart such attacks by both detecting and rectifying them. The main novelty of the proposed detector is that we convert the AE detection problem into a comparison problem by exploiting the inherent limitation of L 0 attacks. More concretely, given an image I, it is pre-processed to obtain another image I'. A Siamese network, which is known to be effective in comparison, takes I and I'as the input pair to determine whether I is an AE. A trained Siamese network automatically and precisely captures the discrepancies between I and I'to detect L 0 perturbations. In addition, we show that the pre-processing technique, inpainting, used for detection can also work as an effective defense, which has a high probability of removing the adversarial influence of L 0 perturbations. Thus, our system, called AEPECKER, demonstrates not only high AE detection accuracies, but also a notable capability to correct the classification results.",13

Heap memory snapshot assisted program analysis for android permission specification,Lannan Luo,2020/2/18,"Conference 2020 IEEE 27th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)","Given a permission-based framework, its permission specification, which is a mapping between API methods of the framework and the permissions they require, is important for software developers and analysts.

One of the common building blocks for static analysis is the generation of a global call graph. However, as common for object-oriented languages, the target of a virtual function call depends on the runtime type of the receiving object, which is undecidable statically.

Validating the Contextual Information of Outdoor Images for Photo Misuse Detection,"Xiaopeng Li, Xianshan Qu, Wenyuan Xu, Song Wang, Yan Tong, Lannan Luo",2018/11/21,Journal arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08951,"The contextual information (i.e., the time and location) in which a photo is taken can be easily tampered with or falsely claimed by forgers to achieve malicious purposes, e.g., creating fear among the general public. A rich body of work has focused on detecting photo tampering and manipulation by verifying the integrity of image content. Instead, we aim to detect photo misuse by verifying the capture time and location of photos. This paper is motivated by the law of nature that sun position varies with the time and location, which can be used to determine whether the claimed contextual information corresponds with the sun position that the image content actually indicates. Prior approaches to inferring sun position from images mainly rely on vanishing points associated with at least two shadows, while we propose novel algorithms which utilize only one shadow in the image to infer the sun position. Meanwhile, we compute the sun position by applying astronomical algorithms which take as input the claimed capture time and location. Only when the two estimated sun positions are consistent can the claimed contextual information be genuine. We have developed a prototype called IMAGEGUARD. The experimental results show that our method can successfully estimate sun position and detect the time-location inconsistency with high accuracy. By setting the thresholds to be 9.4 degrees and 5 degrees for the sun position distance and the altitude angle distance, respectively, our system can correctly identify 91.5% of falsified photos with fake contextual information.",
